Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a women's everyday basic T-shirt. Historically, the last 5 weeks of demand (Jan 7 to Feb 10) have been relatively stable: 61, 71, 61, 52, 51. The mean demand across these 5 samples is 59.2. Since this is an 'Everyday Basic' item and it is mid-February, I expect demand to remain consistent or slightly increase as we move toward spring. Promised lead time is 0. I will use the recent N=5 samples to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters, as they reflect the most recent demand environment. Setting L to 'default' matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's basic T-shirt. Historically (Jan-Feb), demand has been around 50-70 units. However, in Period 1 (Feb 11), demand spiked to 98 units, causing a stockout as only 67 were ordered (based on previous averages). Promised lead time L=0 was confirmed by the Period 1 arrival. Given the stockout and the recent jump to 98, I will use a recent_N approach to capture this higher demand regime. N=3 is chosen for demand forecasting to weigh the recent spike heavily while still acknowledging earlier February levels. L is set to default (0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) averaged 59.2 units. Recent performance (Periods 1 and 2) shows a significant demand surge to 98 and 92 units respectively (+~60%). This likely reflects a peak for 'Everyday Basics' as spring approaches. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is indeed 0 (P1 and P2 orders arrived immediately). However, in both P1 and P2, demand exceeded the amount ordered, resulting in lost sales and 0 ending inventory. We need to raise the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this higher regime. I will use the mean of the most recent 2 periods (avg 95) as the basis, as it's significantly higher than the 5-week pre-game average. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 11 (Period 1): demand increased from a 5-week average of 59 to an average of 95 (+61%). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4 (2019/03/04). History shows a clear demand regime shift since we started (Period 1). The 5-week historical mean was 59, but the actual demand in Periods 1-3 was 98, 92, and 130 respectively (average of 106.6). This is a women's basic T-shirt; we are entering the spring season, which likely explains the sustained upward trend. Crucially, in all three periods, demand exceeded supply (Ending Inventory = 0), meaning we are losing profit. Lead time is confirmed as 0. I am increasing mu_hat using the explicit method to 140 (targeted to cover the growing demand + buffer) to prevent further stockouts. sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this new higher-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1 confirmed: mean increased from 59 to 106.6 (+80%) with a growing trend (P3 demand was 130). Sustained stockouts occurred in P1-P3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '561445006' (women's short-sleeved t-shirt) experienced a significant demand regime shift starting in Period 1 (mid-February), likely driven by seasonal transition into spring. The baseline mean was 59, but we saw a jump to an average of 101 over the last four weeks (98, 92, 130, 84). The Period 3 demand of 130 and Period 4 demand of 84 suggest high volatility (std dev ~19.5 in the post-shift window). Lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. To handle the increased volume and recent volatility while accounting for the lower Period 4 demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) for the demand mean and standard deviation. This covers the entire new regime. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed 0-day lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Post-Feb 11 average is 101 units/week compared to pre-shift 59. Volatility has increased significantly during this shift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, which is a staple item. Since Period 1 (Feb 11), we've observed a significant demand regime shift from the early January average (~59) to a higher level. Over the last 5 periods (P1-P5), the average demand is 101.2 (98, 92, 130, 84, 102). Although P4 showed a slight dip to 84, P5 recovered to 102, confirming the higher demand level is sustained as the season moves into Spring. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory managed to avoid stockouts in the last two periods (P4-P5) after three consecutive weeks of selling out. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime (approx 101 units/week) and its associated volatility. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%, so the OR backend will calculate a base stock slightly above the mean. Setting L to default (0) as it is reliable.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '561445006' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) experienced a significant demand shift starting Period 1 (Feb 11). Previous demand (Jan-Feb early) averaged ~59 units/week, while the post-shift average (Period 1 to 6) is 101.17 units/week. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. The most recent three periods (P4-P6) show demand of 84, 102, and 101, suggesting the regime has stabilized around ~100. Because the lead time is 0, the base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) must cover only the current period's demand (1+L = 1). I will use the recent 6 periods to calculate the forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this new elevated baseline while filtering out the pre-Feb 11 data. The ending on-hand of 15 units is slightly low, so the OR backend should trigger an order of approximately 85-90 units to return to the ~100 base stock level.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Since Period 1 (Feb 11), a shift in demand from an average of 59 to approximately 101 units per week has been observed and stabilized. The last four periods (P4-P7) show demand values of 84, 102, 101, and 105, which confirms this new regime (mean \u2248 98). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Despite the stabilization, we keep seeing low ending inventory (ending at 10 units in P7), suggesting we are close to the service level limit. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (the entire post-shift period) to capture the current mean, and sigma_hat using the same window to address the increased volatility observed during the shift.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak spring/summer season (early April). Since the demand regime shift in Period 1 (Feb 11), demand has stabilized at a high level. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P1-P8) is 103.25, while the last 4 periods (P5-P8) have a mean of 105.5 with very low variance (Standard Deviation \u2248 5.7). In Period 8, we sold 114 units and ended with 0 inventory, indicating potential unmet demand at the margin. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the full demand and account for the spring seasonal ramp-up, I will use a recent window (N=5) to reflect the current stable high-demand state while setting an explicit sigma to account for the risk of stockouts seen in the recent period.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a high-level regime post-Feb 11 shift, with a 5-period average (P4-P8) of 101.2 units vs. pre-shift 59. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt, which experienced a significant demand regime shift starting in mid-February, likely due to spring seasonality. The demand has stabilized at a higher level with a post-shift average of approximately 101 units per week (periods 1-9 average is 101.4). In-transit inventory is 0 and the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. The ending inventory for Period 9 was 27 units. I will use a recent_N approach (N=9) to capture the entire post-shift regime for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), as this period covers the new baseline more accurately than the full history, which includes the lower pre-February demand. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as histories show lead time is reliably 0.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. The product is a women's short-sleeved t-shirt, a basic summer item. Demand remains in the higher regime established in Period 1 (post-Feb 11). Over the last 10 periods (P1-P10), the mean demand is 103.8. The most recent demand (P10) was 125, causing a stockout as it exceeded starting on-hand (114). Historically, April and moving into May see rising demand for summer basics. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the full post-shift regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level targets this higher average and accounts for recent volatility to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (75% service level).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445006 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is experiencing a significant demand surge coinciding with the spring season. In Period 11 (April 22), demand spiked to 183 units, well above the previous stabilized average of approximately 101 units observed between Periods 4-9. This indicates a second regime shift or a strong seasonal trend as the weather warms. Stockouts have occurred in the last two periods (P10 and P11), with 100% of available inventory sold. Lead time remains confirmed as 0. To capture this recent spike and prevent further lost sales, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (averaging 87, 125, 183 = ~131) and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on a high target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), ensuring we cover the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand spike detected starting late April (Period 11): demand reached 183 units, a 45% increase over the previous high-regime average (~101). Current 3-period average (P9-P11) is 131.6 units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in the middle of a seasonal demand increase for this T-shirt SKU, which likely corresponds to the spring/summer transition. Demand jumped significantly in Period 11 (183 units) but settled back to 117 in Period 12. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The transition from the late April spike (P11) to early May (P12) suggests a higher but more volatile baseline than the previous March/April regime. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the shift that began in Period 9 (87, 125, 183, 117), which averages 128 units per week. This provides a balance between the extreme spike in P11 and the normalization in P12, ensuring sufficient stock for the seasonal peak while managing holding costs for this basic jersey top.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand volatility confirmed in May: Demand peak of 183 (P11) moderated to 117 (P12). Current seasonal average (P9-P12) is 128 units/week, up 26% from previous high regime (101).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. This product is a women's short-sleeved t-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring/summer season. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 11 (late April), likely due to seasonal weather changes. The demand in Period 11 was 183 (stockout limited sales), Period 12 was 117, and Period 13 was 133. The average demand across this seasonal onset (P11-P13) is 144.3 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels have been tight, leading to multiple stockouts (P8, P10, P11). Given the current profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the QR target is 0.80, which favors a higher service level. I will use a N=5 period lookback for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher seasonal demand level while softening the extreme peak of P11. N=5 covers periods 9 through 13, averaging approximately 129 units per week, which provides a safe buffer for the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed seasonal demand plateau: May demand (P12-P13) has settled at an average of 125 units, following the initial late-April peak (P11) of 183.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's fitted jersey T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring/summer seasonal regime. Demand spiked significantly in late April (P11: 183) and has since settled into a higher-level plateau. The demand for the last four periods (P11-P14) has been 183, 117, 133, and 141, averaging approximately 143.5 units per week. This represents a clear shift from the previous 'high regime' average of ~101. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent seasonal level while accounting for the high volatility observed during May, I will use recent_N with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal average of ~143 and the variance associated with the recent 183-unit peak, protecting against stockouts during this high-demand window.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's T-shirt, which is currently in its peak spring/summer season. Since Period 11 (late April), demand has entered a higher seasonal regime. The last five periods (P11-P15) show demand values of 183, 117, 133, 141, and 148, resulting in a 5-period average of 144.4. This is a significant increase from the previous high-regime average of approximately 101. The transition to summer suggests this plateau (around 140-150 units) will likely persist or slightly increase. Lead time is consistently 0. I will transition the demand forecast to use recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized seasonal peak while accounting for the high volatility observed (std dev is significant due to the 183 spike). This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the updated mean (~144) and the seasonal variance.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak stabilized: May demand (P11-P15) average is 144.4 units, representing a 43% increase over the early spring regime (101).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a women's short-sleeved jersey t-shirt, which is in peak seasonal demand during the summer months. Period 16 showed a significant demand spike to 190 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). This follows a previously identified high-demand regime that stabilized around 144 units throughout May. Period 16's demand (190) is approximately 32% higher than the May average. Given the early June timing, demand is expected to remain high and potentially increase further. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture the June peak, I am shifting the mu_hat focus to recent_N=3 (Periods 14-16) to capture the accelerating trend (average 160 units). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 (covering most of the summer seasonal peak) will provide an appropriate volatility estimate to calculate safety stock for this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal demand surge: Period 16 demand reached 190 units, a 32% increase over the May average (144.4). Stockout occurred in P16 despite increased ordering.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's T-shirt, which is experiencing significant seasonal demand as we enter June. Since Period 11 (late April), demand has entered a higher and more volatile regime. Recent periods show a May average of 144.4 (P11-P15), followed by a peak of 190 in P16 and a cooling to 109 in P17 (June 3rd). A stockout occurred in P16, and P17's lower demand resulted in 75 units remaining on-hand. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the move into full summer, I expect demand to remain higher than the spring average of 101, but the volatility is high. I will use recent_N=7 (covering P11-P17) to capture this summer seasonal regime (mean ~ 146). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for recent high demand and increased variance while considering the current on-hand inventory of 75.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal demand shows high volatility: following a peak of 190 (P16), demand dropped to 109 (P17). The summer regime (P11-P17) currently averages 146 units/week.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June) managing a women's T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal increase starting from late April (P11), with demand currently characterized by high volatility (recent weekly demands: 190, 109, 81). The average demand for the 'summer regime' (P11-P18) is approximately 144 units. However, the last two periods (P17 and P18) have shown a cooling trend (109 followed by 81). Given the current on-hand inventory of 91 units and a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, I need to set parameters that recognize the overall high summer level while acknowledging the recent dip. Using recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the summer regime since the P11 spike) for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this elevated summer mean (~144) and the high volatility (std dev ~37) better than long-term averages. Lead time remains consistently at 0.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved women's T-shirt, which is experiencing a sustained summer seasonal peak. Since Period 11, the average demand has been approximately 144 units, though it exhibits significant volatility (range 81-190). Period 19 demand was 146, which is aligned with the seasonal average. In the last 4 periods (P16-P19), demand has been 190, 109, 81, and 146, averaging 131.5. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering P15-P19) to capture this summer regime while smoothing recent volatility. Lead time is consistently 0. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility seen in the current seasonal window (~42 units/period std dev).

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal regime (P11-P19) confirmed: Average demand ~144 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~38).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a women's fitted jersey T-shirt, which is a summer staple. Historically, demand for this SKU shifted from a spring average of ~101 (Periods 4-8) to a summer seasonal regime starting in late April (Period 11), averaging ~138 units over the last 10 periods (P11-P20). Although recent demand (P20: 109, P18: 81) has been lower than the seasonal peak, historical peaks reach up to 190. In early July, we remain in peak summer demand. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this summer regime (P11-P20 mean = 135.7, std dev = 34.6) while maintaining responsiveness to volatility as we move deeper into July. Profit/Holding cost ratio suggests a service level (q) of 0.80.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, and we are in the heart of the summer season for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt. Historical lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods. The summer demand regime (starting around Period 11, late April) has shown significant volatility, with demand swinging between 73 and 190. While the most recent period (P21) saw a dip to 73, the peak summer months (July/August) are likely to maintain high average demand. The average demand for the 'summer' regime (P11-P21) is approximately 130. units, though the last 5 periods (P17-P21) have averaged 103.6 units due to recent fluctuations. Given the potential for high-demand spikes in July, I will use a recent_N of 11 (covering the entire summer regime from P11 onwards) to capture the full seasonal volatility and mean (approx 130), preventing under-ordering based solely on the recent 2-week dip. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during a potential July heatwave or sale against the holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' shows a distinct summer seasonal regime that began in late April (Period 11), characterized by an average demand of approximately 144 units with high volatility. However, the last three periods (P20-P22) have shown a consistent decline in demand: 109, 73, and 56 respectively. This suggests the peak summer demand is beginning to wind down as households likely completed their core seasonal basic shopping earlier in the summer. Specifically, the average of the last 3 periods is ~79 units, compared to the previously observed 144 units. To avoid excessive holding costs as demand cools, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5. This window captures the end of the high-demand period and the current downward trend (averaging ~99 units), providing a safer bridge than the full summer history. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: July demand (P21-P22) has dropped significantly below the summer average of 144, with P22 demand at 56 units, suggestings the seasonal peak for this basic T-shirt is ending.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt is confirming a downward trend as we move further into July (Period 24). The 'summer seasonal regime' (averaging ~144 units) has clearly ended. Demand over the last three periods (P21-P23) has been 73, 56, and 92, averaging 73.7 units. This represents a significant softening compared to the previous regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs ($1.0/unit) for a lower-margin item ($4.0/unit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower demand level while maintaining enough inventory to fulfill the current trend. A base stock target using these parameters will align inventory with the immediate post-peak demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: July demand (P21-P23) has dropped to an average of 73.7 units, down approximately 50% from the summer peak average of 144, indicating the end of the seasonal peak for this basic jersey top.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445006 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is clearly exiting its high-demand summer seasonal regime. Historical demand peaked mid-summer (avg ~144 units/week), but the last four periods (P21-P24) show a significant softening with demand values of 73, 56, 92, and 78. Current date is late July (2019/7/29). As the school season and autumn approach, demand for this 'Jersey Basic' is settling into a lower, more stable regime. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 74.75. Lead time remains consistent at 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this downward shift and avoid overstocking as the seasonal peak ends, while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer to account for the residual volatility seen in Period 23.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed late July: 4-period average (P21-P24) is 74.75 units/week, a ~48% decrease from the summer peak average of 144. Support for 'Jersey Basic' seasonality follows a traditional summer peak cooling off into August.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' tops has clearly transitioned from a high-summer peak (avg ~144) to a lower August regime. Over the last five periods (P21-P25), the demand has averaged 71.8 units (73, 56, 92, 78, 60), confirming the 'softening' observed in the carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is currently 28. Lead time remains stable at 0. To prevent overstocking as the season ends and to maintain the now-lower target inventory levels, I will adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new, lower demand regime. This period (P26, Aug 5) continues the post-peak trend. The backend's base-stock calculation with these parameters will automatically account for the current 28 units on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Billie' jersey tops remains in a post-summer cooling phase. The current date is August 12. Since late July (Period 21), demand has shifted from a summer peak average of ~144 to a lower regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is 72.8 units (73, 56, 92, 78, 60, 78). This confirms the 'regime softening' noted in previous carry-over insights. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current demand level, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this lower late-summer demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts has transitioned out of the summer peak (avg ~144) into a stable late-summer/pre-autumn regime. Demand for the last 7 periods (P21-P27) has averaged 69 units. The most recent demand (P27) was 47, which aligns with the observed downward trend as we move through August. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for this lower-demand regime, I am setting the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to reflect the most recent 7 periods (N=7). This provides a more accurate forecast for the current softening trend compared to using the all-time history, which is heavily skewed by the high spring and summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level for August: 7-period average (P21-P27) is 69 units/week, down from the summer peak of 144 units (-52%).

Over the last 8 periods (P21-P28), demand has averaged 67.6 units (73, 56, 92, 78, 60, 78, 47, 57). This follows a typical seasonal cycle for basic apparel as late summer progresses. The most recent demand (P28) was 57, and the 4-period average is 60.5. I am setting the demand regime length (N) to 8 to capture the stabilized post-peak behavior while smoothing out the minor weekly fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Billie' (Women's Everyday Basics Jersey Top) has clearly transitioned from its high-summer peak (approx. 144 units/week) into a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime. The last 9 periods (P21-P29) represent this new regime, characterized by an average demand of approximately 68.3 units. The most recent three periods (P27-P29) show demand of 47, 57, and 44, suggesting a potentially deeper softening as we enter September. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining seasonal market, I will use a recent_N method with N=9 to capture this lower regime's mean and variance, while remaining responsive to the current downward trend. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further in late August: 9-period average (P21-P29) is 68 units/week, with the 3 most recent periods (P27-P29) averaging 49 units, indicating a continued seasonal decline entering autumn.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts has transitioned into a stabilized lower-level regime for the autumn season. We are currently in Period 31 (Sept 9). Looking at the history starting from the seasonal downshift in Period 21 (July 1), demand has consistently lowered. Specifically, the last four periods (P27-P30) show demand values of 47, 57, 44, and 40, averaging 47 units per week. This indicates a further slowing from the initial August average of ~68. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures this current late-season baseline while allowing for a slight buffer over the most recent observation of 40. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the service level requirement (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) is moderate and holding costs are significant ($1/unit), I will aim to match the current demand floor to avoid unnecessary inventory build-up during this declining seasonal phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened in early September: 4-period average (P27-P30) reached 47 units/week, down from the August average of 68 units (-30%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445006 (Womens Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a clear seasonal decline as we move into mid-September. Historical data shows demand has dropped from a summer high of ~144 units to a recent 4-week average (P28-P31) of 43.5 units. The most recent demand (P31) was 33, indicating that the 'Jersey Basic' category is reaching its autumn baseline. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs on a low-margin basic item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this downward trend accurately while maintaining a buffer for the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened mid-September: 4-period average (P28-P31) is 43.5 units/week, a significant drop from the August average of 68 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained seasonal decline as it enters late September. Reviewing the demand history: P29 (44), P30 (40), P31 (33), and P32 (21) show a clear downward trend. The most recent 4-period average is 34.5 units per week, which is a significant drop from the August average. Using recent_N with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this continued softening while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet the lower demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 31 units, which is close to the recent weekly average, meaning the order will be small to align with the base stock target for this lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened in late September: 4-period average (P29-P32) is 34.5 units/week, down from the early September average of 43.5 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic' T-shirts continues its seasonal decline as we move further into autumn. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has averaged 34.2 units (44, 40, 33, 21, 33). The most recent 3 periods (P31-P33) average 29 units. Given this clear downward trend, I am using a recent_N window of 4 periods to capture the current lower demand regime (averaging 31.75 units) while allowing for some week-to-week volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by the game history. Setting L=0 with recent_N=4 for demand and volatility will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that supports this lower volume without overstocking, as the seasonal cooling continues.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened into late September: 5-period average (P29-P33) settled at 34.2 units/week, a ~50% decrease from the August average of 68 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt (561445006) has continued its seasonal decline into late September. Evaluating the most recent period (P34), demand was 35 units, which aligns with the trend observed over the last four periods (P31-P34 average of 30.5 units). This represents a significant drop from the August levels (avg 68) and early September levels (avg 43.5). Given the item is a basic short-sleeved top, demand is expected to continue softening or stabilizing at a low baseline as autumn progresses in October. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this latest downward regime shift (P31-P34) accurately, which will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the lower demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened in late September/early October: 4-period average (P31-P34) is 30.5 units/week, down from the mid-September average of 43.5 units (-30%).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Billie' jersey top continues its clear seasonal decline into mid-October. The most recent 5-period average (P31-P35) has fallen to 29 units/week, significantly lower than the August average (68 units) and the summer peak (144 units). Specifically, Period 35 demand was 23 units. With an on-hand inventory of 13 units and a consistently observed lead time of 0 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this established low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering as we enter late October. L remains 'default' (0) as all historical orders have arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened mid-October: 5-period average (P31-P35) is 29 units/week, continuing the seasonal decline from the August average of 68 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 561445006 continues its seasonal decline as we move further into October. The product is a 'Jersey Basic' short-sleeved top, which typically sees its lowest demand during the autumn and winter months. In Period 36, demand dropped to 10 units, the lowest observed since the game began. The 4-period average (P33-P36) is 25.25 units, while the 2-period average (P35-P36) is only 16.5 units. Given the consistent downward trend over the last several months (from a peak of 144 to the current sub-20 levels), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=4 to capture this low-demand regime without over-reacting to the single lowest data point of 10. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current seasonal levels to minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached a new seasonal low of 10 units in Period 36. The autumn downshift is fully established, with the 5-period average (P32-P36) sitting at 24.4 units, a 64% decrease from the August average of 68 units.

The demand for 'Jersey Basic' t-shirts is in a sustained seasonal decline as we enter late October. Period 37 demand was 22 units, and the 5-period average (P33-P37) is approximately 25 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory during this downward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 5-period window (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime, while keeping L at its promised 0 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt is in a stable late-autumn low-demand regime. Following the significant seasonal decline from summer peaks, demand has leveled off over the last few weeks. The 5-period average (P34-P38) is 22 units/week, and specifically the last three periods (P36-P38) show a tight range of 10 to 22 units (average 17.3). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 14 units and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio favoring a high service level (q = 0.8), I will set the demand parameters to reflect this current low-regime stability (N=5) to ensure sufficient stock while minimizing holding costs as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn low: 5-period average (P34-P38) is 22 units/week, down from the June/July summer peak of ~144 units (-85%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt has stabilized at its autumn low. The most recent 5-period average (P35-P39) is 18.0 units, down from the previous autumn average of 22 units. Period 39 demand was 15 units. There is no evidence of a lead time shift; arrivals remain consistent with the promised 0-period lead time. Given the low demand and 15 units already on-hand, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this stability and avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase. Sigma_hat is also set using N=5 to capture current local volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at autumn low: 5-period average (P35-P39) is 18.0 units/week, a further slight decline from the late October average of 22. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445006 is in a stable autumn/winter low-demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has averaged 16.4 units (samples: 10, 22, 20, 15, 15), representing a significant decrease from the summer peak. The current inventory is 8 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current stabilized low mean and variance. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period demand coverage requirement, ensuring we replenish just enough to meet the current ~16 units/week pace.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late autumn low: 5-period average (P36-P40) is 16.4 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445006 (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently in a late autumn seasonal low. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower regime compared to the summer peak. The most recent 5-period average (P37-P41) is 16.8 units (22, 20, 15, 15, 12). Period 41 demand was 12 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current stabilized low-regime mean (~16.8 units) and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the current lower volatility. L remains at default/calculate (0).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand spiked unexpectedly to 43 units, significantly higher than the late-autumn average of ~16 units. This is likely a seasonal 'Black Friday' or early-December holiday event effect for this Jersey Basic top. The 5-period average (P38-P42) has consequently risen to 21 units. Since we are entering December (P43 starts 2019/12/2), I anticipate this elevated demand might persist or fluctuate as holiday shopping continues. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts (which occurred in P42), I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use recent demand (last 3 periods, averaging ~23.3 units) to capture this upward movement. I will also increase sigma_hat using a recent window (last 5 periods) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Early holiday demand spike detected in P42: demand increased from an average of 16 to 43 units (+168%) around late November.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are in the mid-holiday season. Period 42 saw a significant demand spike to 43 units (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday), which was followed by a sharp drop to 9 units in Period 43. This high volatility is typical for December. Considering the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' jersey top, we should expect another potential spike as we approach the final two weeks of December (weeks ending Dec 16 and Dec 23) before the post-holiday slump. The 5-period average (P39-P43) is 18.8 units, but the high variance (std ~15) suggests we need to buffer for potential pre-holiday demand. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 30 to account for potential mid-December shopping, and 'explicit' sigma_hat of 15 to handle the established holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Observed peak of 43 in P42 followed by drop to 9 in P43. Expected volatility remains high through late December.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday period (Period 45). Demand has shown high volatility recently with a spike to 43 (P42) followed by 9 (P43) and 26 (P44). This is consistent with holiday shopping patterns for basic jersey tops. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this holiday volatility while avoiding over-stocking as we approach the end of the year, I will use a short-term average (recent_N=4) for mu_hat (covering P41-P44, avg ~22.5) and sigma_hat (to account for the wide range between 9 and 43). This ensures we have enough stock for potential late-December spikes without excessive holding costs for a low-cost item ($1.0 holding vs $4.0 profit).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak holiday shopping week (Dec 23). Historical demand for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt showed a spike in late November (P42, demand 43) followed by volatility. Recent demand (P44-P45) has stabilized around an average of 27 units. However, given it is the week of Christmas, we should anticipate either a final last-minute surge or the beginning of the post-holiday clearance dip. Transitioning from the autumn low (avg ~16) to the holiday regime, the last 4 periods (P42-P45) averaged 26.5 units with high variance. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this holiday demand average while allowing for the high volatility (sigma) observed during this period to maintain a safe service level and avoid stockouts like the one seen in P42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P42-P45): average demand increased to 26.5 units/week from the autumn low of 16.4 (+61%), accompanied by high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, marking the transition out of the holiday season. The demand regime for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has averaged 25.0 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~13), reflecting holiday shopping patterns. Looking at the SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt), demand is expected to cool down in early January before the spring ramp-up. The promised lead time of 0 consistently matches actual observed lead time. Given the high volatility in the holiday regime, I will use a conservative N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the recent holiday levels while accounting for the expected start of the post-holiday dip. On-hand inventory is 20 units, which is close to the recent average demand, necessitating a moderate order to maintain service levels during the transition.
