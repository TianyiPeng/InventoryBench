Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11), managing a 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' bralette. This is the first decision period, and historical demand data shows samples: 96, 105, 130, 150 (Jan), and a sharp drop to 58 on 2019-02-04. The average of all 5 samples is 107.8. Given the Valentine's Day (Feb 14) timing, the most recent drop to 58 (Feb 4) suggests a post-restock or pre-holiday dip, or possibly a stockout in the source data. Since the current date is Feb 11, we should prepare for potential high demand around Valentine's Day and the subsequent period. Promised lead time is 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the trend while the 'explicit' parameter is not strictly necessary yet until more real-time data arrives. However, I'll set L to 'default' (0) as promised.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's lingerie item (bra). The historical demand showed a rising trend in January (96, 105, 130, 150) before dropping in early February (58). Period 1 actual demand was 28, confirming a post-Valentine's Day slump typical for this category. In-transit is 0 because the Period 1 order arrived immediately (actual lead time = 0, matching promised). Given the current on-hand of 138 and the recent low demand (58, 28), the mean of all samples (96, 105, 130, 150, 58, 28) is ~94.5. However, the most recent two weeks (58, 28) suggest a lower regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent cooling trend (avg ~60) while maintaining enough buffer for potential stabilization. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lingerie item (Clarence Push Wireless Bralette). Demand in the pre-game samples showed an upward trend through January (reaching 150) before dropping significantly in early February (58). In Period 1 and 2, demand has been 28 and 48 respectively. The promised lead time of 0 periods is currently being honored (orders placed arrive in the same period). Given the low demand in February and the high on-hand inventory (136 units vs current demand of ~40/week), the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 (covering Period 1, Period 2, and the last historical sample from Feb 4th) to capture the current lower demand regime. Lead time remains 'default' at 0.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579302001 is a 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (Lingerie/Bra). Historical demand samples showed a significant drop in early February (96, 105, 130, 150, down to 58). However, observed demand in the game has been steadily increasing: P1=28, P2=48, P3=60. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent with P1 and P2, orders arrive within the same period. The current date is March 4th. Demand for lingerie often sees a moderate uptick in early spring. The recent three-period trend (28, 48, 60) indicates a local recovery from the low of 58. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current trend, rather than the much higher January samples. L is set to default (0) as evidenced by the perfect 0-period arrivals in P1 and P2.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. The product is a women's bra/lingerie item. Historical data (including pre-game samples) shows a significant demand increase: P1(28), P2(48), P3(60), P4(101). The pre-game samples also showed a trend (96, 105, 130, 150) before a dip (58). Current on-hand is 0 following a stockout in Period 4 (demand 101, sold 76). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in P1 and P2 confirm actual lead time has been 0. I need to set mu_hat to cover the rising demand trend to recover from the stockout and prevent future lost sales. Given the recent trajectory (60, 101) and the item's nature, I'll use a recent window for demand to capture the upward momentum. Setting N=3 for mu_hat specifically considers the acceleration in the last few weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Significant upward trend observed from Period 1 (28) to Period 4 (101), resulting in a stockout. Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Clarence Push Wireless Bra. Current date is March 18, 2019. We observed a clear upward demand trend from Period 1 (28) through Period 4 (101), which resulted in a stockout in Period 4. Period 5 saw a slight cooling (75 units), but demand remains significantly higher than the initial averages. Historical samples from January/February suggest a mean around 100 with a peak of 150. Given the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the OR engine needs to cover the current period's demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent growth while acknowledging the Period 5 slight dip. Setting mu_hat to explicitly match the recent high demand (avg of last 3 periods is ~78, but P4 was 101) to buffer against further stockouts during this spring season.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (a non-wired push-up bralette) is experiencing a period of high and volatile demand. Looking at historical samples and recent performance: demand grew significantly through early March (reaching 101 in P4). While it dipped to 75 in P5, it rebounded to 91 in P6. The average demand across the last 4 periods (P3-P6) is 81.75 units, significantly higher than the initial periods. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (immediate arrival). To prevent further stockouts (as seen in P4) while managing the $1.00 holding cost versus the $19.00 profit margin, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=4 for mu_hat captures the current high-demand regime, while using N=4 for sigma_hat accounts for the recent volatility (std dev approx 17). This ensures the base stock stays high enough to satisfy the current 75-100 units/period demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: demand average for P3-P6 (81.75 units) is significantly higher than P1-P2 (38 units). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a floral lace bralette, a category that often sees increased demand during the spring season. Historical demand shows a clear upward shift starting around P3-P4. The last 4 periods (P4-P7) show a mean demand of 91 units (101, 75, 91, 97), which is significantly higher than the early period mean. This represents a sustained regime shift. Lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods across multiple arrivals (P1, P2, P5, P6, P7). To maintain service levels and account for the spring seasonal trend, I will set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on a recent window of 5 periods (P3-P7), effectively capturing the new high-demand level since the volume increased from the initial baseline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (wireless bra). Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime following an initial ramp-up. Over the last 4 periods (P5-P8), demand has been consistently high: 75, 91, 97, and 91, averaging 88.5 units. The pre-game samples (which averaged 107.8) and the early game periods (P1-P4) are less relevant now that a stable trend has emerged. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-ramp-up regime. By setting L=0 and calculating demand based on the last 4 weeks, the OR backend will target a base stock sufficient to cover one period of demand plus a safety margin balanced against the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P5-P9) for 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (Womens Lingerie) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial periods, averaging approximately 84.4 units per period (compared to 38 early on). The demand sequence [75, 91, 97, 91, 68] shows some volatility but confirms the shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. For Period 10, I am setting L to 'calculate' based on history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (P5-P9) to capture the current regime average (approx. 84 units/period), which provides a base_stock target around 85-95 units (accounting for safety stock) to meet next period's demand while minimizing holding costs on the 37 units currently on-hand. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (Womens Lingerie) peaked between late February and late March (Periods 4-8), reaching over 100 units. Since Period 9 (April 8th), we have seen a noticeable decline (68, then 49 units). This suggests the post-winter/early spring peak is subsiding. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs as demand cools, I am adjusting the demand forecast using a 'recent_N' approach where N=4 (capturing the most recent transition from high to moderate demand). This will result in a mu_hat reflective of the current ~58 unit average (P9-P10) while still accounting for recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Following a late-spring peak (avg ~90 units), demand has declined for two consecutive periods (68 and 49), suggesting a transition to a moderate-demand phase.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (bralette). Historically, we saw a peak in demand through March and early April (averaging ~90 units from P4-P8), likely corresponding to spring seasonal trends. Demand has consistently softened over the last three periods: 68, 49, and 47 units. This confirms a transition from a high-demand regime to a moderate/lower-demand phase as we move toward late spring. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level for the current regime, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (averaging the last three periods: 68, 49, 47), which captures this downward shift more accurately than the long-term average. N=3 is selected as it encapsulates the post-peak softening.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decline: Demand has stabilized at a lower level (avg 54.7 over P9-P11) compared to the spring peak (avg 90 over P4-P8).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation for Period 12 (104 units) contradicts the previous 'softening' regime (avg ~54 over P9-P11). This spike coincides with early May (2019/4/29), suggesting a cyclical or seasonal surge in late spring/early summer for this 'lace bralette'. We had a stockout in Period 12 (sold 74 out of 104 demand) because the order was insufficient (on-hand 0). With a confirmed lead time of 0, we must ensure base stock covers the current period's demand immediately. Given the high volatility (recent jump from 47 to 104), I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent peak (104) to avoid further stockouts, while using a recent window (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance (47 vs 104).

Carry-over insight: Renewed demand spike at Period 12: Demand jumped from 47 to 104 (+121%), potentially indicating a seasonal shift or promotion for early May.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 starts mid-May. Previous demand in Period 12 (104) and Period 13 (100) confirms a significant upward regime shift, likely seasonal, compared to the lower demand seen in April (avg ~55). My carry-over insight from P13 noted this spike. Current on-hand is 47 units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this high-demand phase, I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat to capture the most recent local average (approx 102 units/period). For sigma_hat, I'll use N=5 to provide enough stability to prevent excessive stockouts, given the recent volatility and previous stockout in P12. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for mid-May: P12-P13 average demand is 102 units, compared to P9-P11 average of 54.7 (+86%).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (Lingerie) has entered a new sustained high-demand phase starting around Period 12 (late April/early May). Demand for the last three periods (P12, P13, P14) has been 104, 100, and 104 units respectively, resulting in a consistent mean of approximately 102.7 units. This represents a significant jump from the April softening period (P9-P11 avg of ~55) and is even higher than the previous spring peak in March (P4-P8 avg of ~91). We are currently in mid-May, and this high-demand regime is likely to continue. On-hand inventory is 43 units, which is insufficient for the next period's expected demand. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival data. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed 0-period stability.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime for late-May confirmed: Avg demand for P12-P14 is 102.7 units, significantly exceeding the April average of 54.7 and the March peak of 91.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Clarence Push Wireless Farg' (Womens Lingerie) dropped to 66 in Period 15, following a high-demand phase (avg ~103 units during P12-P14). This suggests the late-May peak has subsided, potentially returning to the moderate levels seen in mid-April (avg ~55). However, to avoid another stockout like the ones in P4 and P12, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to weight the recent high-demand period (P12-P15 avg: 93.5) while allowing for the current downward trend. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. The Profit/Holding ratio remains high ($19/$1), justifying a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: After a sustained peak (P12-P14 avg 102.7), Period 15 demand dropped to 66 (-35%), indicating a transition out of the late-May high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2356.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 demand jumped to 139 units, contradicting the 'softening' observed in Period 15 (66 units) and resulting in a stockout. This timing (late May/early June) aligns with the start of summer and increased demand for lingerie/intimates. Since the system is currently at zero on-hand inventory and lead time is confirmed at 0, I need a parameter set that covers this higher realized demand. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 102.6 units. Given the recent volatility (66 followed by 139), I will use an explicit forecast for demand (mu_hat) around 110 units to ensure sufficient stock, while maintaining the calculated lead time which has consistently stayed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Renewed volatility/spike in late May/early June: Demand hit 139 in P16 after a dip to 66 in P15. Current 5-period average (P12-P16) is 102.6 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579302001 is in a high-growth seasonal demand regime (late spring/early summer). Demand has increased sharply: 66 (P14), 139 (P16), and 191 (P17). The current stockout for two consecutive periods (sold limited by on-hand) indicates the OR backend is significantly underestimating mu_hat. The product category (lingerie/bra) and the date (June 10) suggest continued high demand. Lead time remains stable at 0. I am switching mu_hat to 'explicit' to set a base stock level (1+L)*demand that covers the most recent peak (191) plus a safety buffer to prevent further stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility since the regime shift began in P14.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge in early June: Demand reached 191 in P17 (+37% vs P16), leading to consecutive stockouts. Current demand levels are nearly double the mid-May average of 102.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in a high-volatility demand phase for the Clarence Wireless Bralette. Recent demand has been extremely high and erratic: P16 (139), P17 (191), and P18 (129). The surge in early June led to consecutive stockouts in P16 and P17. While demand dipped slightly from 191 to 129 in the most recent period, it remains significantly above the mid-May average of 102. Given the seasonal nature of lingerie/bras and the potential for a June peak, I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this elevated 153-unit average (periods 16-18) while maintaining high volatility (sigma_hat) to protect against further 190+ unit spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize service level by using recent demand statistics to ensure the base stock is high enough to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in June: Demand shifted from a mid-May average of 102.7 to a June peak of 191 followed by 129. Average demand for the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is 153 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579302001' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a high-demand June phase. Recent demand figures are 139, 191, 129, and 139 (P16-P19), yielding a 4-period average of 149.5 units. This is significantly higher than the mid-May average of ~102 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained high-demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand level (approx. 150 units/period) to ensure sufficient stock for the end of June while maintaining the optimal service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: June high-demand regime stabilized: Average demand for P16-P19 is 149.5 units, a 46% increase over the mid-May peak (102.7). Lead time remains 0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, this SKU (a wireless lace bralette) experienced a major demand peak throughout June, with sales reaching up to 191 units. However, demand in the last two periods has cooled to 139 and 108 units respectively. This suggests the peak 'high summer' or early June surge is tapering off into a more stable mid-summer regime. The average demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) is 141.75 units. While Period 20 shows 108 units, setting the forecast based on recent performance (N=4) balances the high June peak with the current softening to prevent a stockout if demand remains volatile. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. By using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will calculate a base stock that covers approximately 142 units of demand plus a safety margin for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating after June peak: Average demand for P17-P20 is 141.75, down from the early June high but still significantly above mid-May levels (~100).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579302001' (a lace push-up bralette) is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Demand in Period 21 unexpected spiked to 188 units, up from 108 in Period 20, following a peak of 191 in Period 17. The current average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 151 units, which is significantly higher than the mid-May average of ~102. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this volatile summer peak and avoid stockouts (as seen in P12, P16, and P17), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand state while excluding the lower-demand spring data. The OR engine's high service level (q=0.95 given profit 19 and holding cost 1) combined with these parameters will maintain a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge confirmed: Period 21 demand (188) returns to June peak levels (191 in P17). Current high-demand regime average (P17-P21) is 151 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579302001' (Womens Lingerie Bralette) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime throughout June and July. Analysis of recent demand indicates a significant mean shift: Period 16-22 demand values are 139, 191, 129, 139, 108, 188, and 150. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is approximately 149.2 units, which is significantly higher than the earlier mid-May average (~102), confirming a established summer peak. Period 22 demand was 150. Given the consistent lead time of 0 (confirmed by all previous periods including P22), a recent_N approach with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat is chosen to capture this higher volatility and volume. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 149.2 unit mean and its associated standard deviation to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: July demand transition confirmed: Average demand for P16-P22 (mid-June to mid-July) has stabilized at approximately 149.2 units, representing a 46% sustained increase over the mid-May 'high' of 102.7 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 579302001 (a wireless lace bralette) shows a high-demand regime throughout June and July, likely driven by summer seasonality. While demand peaked in early June (191) and early July (188), the most recent observation (Period 23) shows a dip to 102. However, looking at the broader summer window (P17-P23), the average demand remains high at approximately 144 units per period. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period responsive ordering. Given the volatility of the recent peaks and the drop in P23, I will use a window of the last 7 periods (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window (P17-P23) covers the entire recent high-demand summer phase, providing a robust mean and variance estimate to maintain a high service level while the OR backend optimizes for the $19 profit weighting. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-day lead time.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (bralette) is currently in a high-demand summer regime, though demand has stabilized somewhat from the June peaks. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P18-P24) is approximately 133 units, compared to the mid-May average of 102. Recent demand shows some volatility (ranging from 102 to 188), but the average remains significantly higher than early Spring levels. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the current July demand stabilization while ignoring older, lower-demand data points. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect the recent volatility observed during this peak season. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~133 units plus a safety buffer for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: July demand stabilization: Average demand for P18-P24 is 133.3 units, confirming a 30% increase over the mid-May 'high' (102.7 units) and establishing a new baseline for the summer season.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. This product is a bralette (lingerie), which typically sees higher demand through the summer season. Looking at the demand history, there was a significant peak in June/July (averaging near 150 units). However, the most recent demand sample from Period 25 dropped to 71 units, following a lower 102 units in Period 23 and 117 units in Period 24. While the summer season is still active, there is evidence of a transition away from the 'extreme' July peak into a more moderate late-summer phase. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P20-P25) is approximately 122.7 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 0 periods throughout the game history. To avoid over-ordering based on the June/July peaks while still maintaining enough stock to cover potential volatility in August, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=6 for mu_hat correctly reflects the current cooling trend (avg ~122.7) compared to the higher P17-P22 average (~149). For sigma_hat, N=6 will capture the recent volatility seen during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening in August: Demand has decreased for three of the last four periods (102, 117, 71), moving away from the 150+ unit peaks seen in June and early July.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. Historical demand for the last few periods (P23-P26: 102, 117, 71, 114) shows a clear deceleration from the June/July summer peak (avg ~150). The 'August softening' noted in the carry-over insights is persisting, with the 4-period average now at 101 units. Period 25 was particularly low (71), while Period 26 saw a slight recovery (114). Given the product is a lace bralette, we are likely exiting the peak summer demand season. I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg ~103.6) while maintaining enough responsiveness to handle the lingering volatility (range 71-117). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which is confirmed by every successful arrival message in history.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: August demand stabilization confirmed at ~100 units. The 4-period average (P23-P26) is 101, down from the June/July average of ~150 (-33%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 showed a massive, unexpected demand spike to 196 units (up from 114 in P26), leading to a stockout. This occurs on August 12th, which may correspond to late summer sales or 'back to university/college' demand for lingerie. Reviewing the history, demand has transitioned from a stable August level of ~100 units to this new high. The previous July peaks were also around 188-191. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this surge, using approximately 175 units to balance the recent spike with the preceding month's average, and increase sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (196 vs 71 within a 3-week window). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals (P27 order arrived P27).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in mid-August: Period 27 demand reached 196 units, a 72% increase over the previous week and matching the summer's highest peaks, likely driven by late-summer promotions or seasonal shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3102.00

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bralette has entered a significantly more volatile and high-volume phase starting in August (late summer). After a period of stabilization around 100 units in early August (P23-P26), demand spiked to 196 in P27 and remained high at 168 in P28. This suggests a late-summer surge, potentially linked to end-of-season shifts or back-to-school/university shopping for lingerie. The average demand over the last two weeks is 182 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I need to ensure the base stock covers this elevated demand immediately to avoid the stockouts seen in P27. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 180 to reflect this current peak regime, while maintaining a high sigma_hat (using recent_N=5 to capture August's high variance) to provide a safety buffer against the observed volatility (range 71 to 196).

Carry-over insight: Late-August demand surge confirmed: P27-P28 average demand is 182 units, a 78% increase over the early-August baseline of 102.5 units (P23-P26), matching the highest peaks observed during the June/July summer season.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1959.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, demand moderated to 111, following the mid-August spike (P27: 196, P28: 168). While the recent 2-week average was 182, the broader August trend shows significant volatility between ~100 and ~200 units. The product is a push-up terrace bralette, often associated with summer and early autumn fashion. As we enter September (P30: 2019/9/2), we must balance the possibility of sustained 'back-to-school' or late-summer demand with the risk of holding too much inventory as the season progresses. Actual lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering P25-P29) which captures the high-volatility window and results in an average demand estimate of approximately 132 units per period (before the (1+L) multiplier), providing a safety buffer while acknowledging the recent dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to account for the high standard deviation observed during the August spikes.

Carry-over insight: September transition: After a late-August peak (P27-P28 avg 182), demand cooled to 111 in P29. The 5-period window (P25-P29) maintains an average of 132 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the single SKU (a lace bralette) has recently cooled following a late-August peak (Period 27: 196, Period 28: 168). Specifically, demand for the last two periods (P29: 111, P30: 89) indicates a transition away from the late-summer 'spike' back toward a more moderate baseline observed earlier in August (P23-P26 average ~100). The last 3 periods (P28-P30) average 122.7 units. Given the seasonality of high-summer/late-summer fashion, I expect demand to stabilize around 100-110 units in September. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering based on the late-August volatility while maintaining a safe service level for the current moderate-demand regime, I will use a recent window (N=4) for mu_hat (average demand P27-P30 is 141) to catch the downward trend but keep a buffer, and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: September demand transition: Demand has declined for two consecutive periods (111, 89) following the late-August peak (196, 168), suggesting a return to the ~100-unit baseline seen in early August.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Historical demand shows a significant decline in September (72, 89, 111) following a late-August peak (168, 196). This suggests a transition from the high-demand summer season back to a lower-demand regime, likely around the 100-unit baseline seen earlier in August. With on-hand inventory at 151 units and current demand trending downwards, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P28-P31) which captures the downward trend (avg ~110). This provides enough safety stock to cover demand during the current period given the 0-period lead time, while preventing overstocking as the season cools. Sigma_hat is set to the recent 4-period standard deviation to reflect current volatility during this transition.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime softening: Demand has transitioned from a late-August peak (avg 182) to a lower level in September (P29-P31 avg 90.7 units), representing a 50% decrease.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 579302001 (Women's Clarence Push Wireless Bralette) is currently in a post-summer softening phase. Historically, demand peaked in June-July (avg ~150) and again in late August (avg 182). Since Period 29 (late August/early September), demand has consistently declined for four periods: 111, 89, 72, and 62. This indicates a shift back towards the lower baseline observed in early spring or a new autumnal regime. The current 3-period average (P30-P32) is approximately 74.3 units, significantly lower than the preceding month. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this downward trend into late September, ensuring the inventory doesn't bloat as sales slow down. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: September demand slowdown confirmed. Demand has decreased for four consecutive periods (111, 89, 72, 62), bringing the recent average to ~74 units, a 60% reduction from the late-August peak (182).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bralette has been in a sustained decline throughout September, with the most recent 4-period average (P30-P33) falling to approximately 79.5 units, down from the late-August peak of 182 units. Period 33 specifically showed a slight uptick to 95 units after four consecutive weeks of decline, indicating that the 'bottom' of this softening regime may be around 75-95 units. Given the transition into early October, demand is expected to remain in this moderate baseline. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent stabilizing level (avg ~80) and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility compared to the summer peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The OR backend with these parameters will maintain a safety stock appropriate for the current lower demand level while avoiding overstocking as the season changes.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor identified: After a 60% decline from late-August peaks, demand has leveled out with a 4-period average (P30-P33) of 79.5 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for the SKU 579302001 (a push-up bralette) has entered a stable post-summer regime. Following a sharp decline from late-August peaks (~180 units), demand has stabilized in September and early October. The last five periods (P30-P34) show demand values of 89, 72, 62, 95, and 66, resulting in a 5-period average of 76.8 units. This confirms the previously identified 'September floor' near 80 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent arrival messages. Inventory levels are currently lean (39 units on-hand), necessitating an order. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this stabilized lower demand level while maintaining sufficient stock for the observed volatility (standard deviation remains relatively high due to the bounce between 60 and 95).

Carry-over insight: October baseline stability: Demand for P30-P34 has stabilized at an average of 76.8 units, confirming the transition out of the high-demand summer and late-August peak periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for SKU 579302001 (Women's Bralette) has stabilized into a mid-autumn baseline following the transition out of the high-demand summer and late-August peak periods. The average demand over the last six periods (P30-P35) is 73.2 units, which is significantly lower than the summer peaks of 150+ units. Period 35 demand was 55 units, continuing the general downward or stable trend. Given that the promised and actual lead times are consistently 0, I will use a conservative window for forecasting. A 'recent_N' of 6 for mu_hat (73.2 units per period) and sigma_hat captures the current regime without being overly influenced by the previous high-demand months. This setting balances the $19.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost by maintaining stock slightly above the recent mean demand.

Carry-over insight: October stability confirmed: Demand for P30-P35 has settled into a consistent lower-volume regime with an average of 73.2 units, down approximately 60% from the late-August peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 579302001 (Women's lace bralette) is currently in a sustained low-volume regime after the summer peaks. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P30-P36) is approximately 68 units, significantly lower than the previous summer and late-August peaks. The most recent demand (P36) dropped further to 37 units, though this may be a single-period outlier or the start of a late-autumn softening. To prevent excess inventory while maintaining a high service level for this $19 profit item, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mean and volatility to capture this October stabilization. Lead time has been consistently 0 throughout the history, so I am maintaining 'calculate' for L. This approach aligns the base stock with the current ~70 unit/period consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed as low-volume October baseline: average demand for P30-P36 is 68.0 units, representing a stable floor following the September decline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 579302001 (Women's Clarence Push Wireless Bra) is currently in a stable, low-volume October regime. The historical data shows a clear transition from a high-demand summer period (June-August peaks of 150-190 units) to a significantly lower and steady baseline in late September and October. Specifically, demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) has been 66, 55, 37, and 39 units respectively, averaging 49.25 units. This is a further decrease from the September early-floor estimate of ~70 units. Given the consistency of these lower numbers, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current stable regime. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has consistently been 0. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the reduced volatility observed in this stable period, ensuring we don't over-stock based on the higher summer variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained late-October demand baseline established: Average demand for P34-P37 has decreased to 49.3 units, compared to the early-October average of ~70 units (-30%).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the SKU 579302001 (Women's Lingerie/Bralette) has entered a low-volume stability phase following the seasonal summer peaks and late-August surge. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has been 66, 55, 37, 39, and 33, representing a consistent downward trend and stabilization toward a late-fall baseline. The 5-period average is 46 units, and the 3-period average is 36.3 units. Given the transition into early November, demand is expected to remain in this moderate-to-low regime before any potential holiday season uptick. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent stabilization while excluding the higher late-September/early-October data. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility in this stable period. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers immediate demand with minimal holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late-fall demand baseline confirmed at ~40 units. Average demand for P36-P38 is 36.3 units, a 47% decrease compared to the early-October average of ~68 units (P30-P36).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU (women's lingerie bralette) has entered a stable low-volume late-fall regime. Over the last four periods (P36-P39), demand has been exceptionally consistent: 37, 39, 33, 33 (average 35.5). This represents a significant step down from the early-October average (~68) and a massive reduction from the summer peaks (>150). The lead time remains reliably 0. I will transition to using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this localized low-demand stability while ignoring the much higher historical summer and spring volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a lower base stock level, reducing holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Late-fall demand floor established at ~35 units. P36-P39 demand is extremely stable (stdev < 3) following the October decline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in a stable late-fall demand regime for this bralette SKU. Demand has been extremely steady over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), with values of 37, 39, 33, 33, and 28 (mean: 34.0, std: 4.3). This represents a significant decline from the October baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. I will transition the forecast to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this precise late-fall floor and prevent overstocking as we approach the end of the game (Period 47). I will use N=5 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the low volatility (stdev is ~4.3 compared to the all-time stdev of 47+).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Late-fall demand floor confirmed at ~34 units (P36-P40 average). Demand is stable with low volatility (stdev 4.3).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has been remarkably stable for the last 6 periods (P36-P41), averaging 33.1 units with a very low standard deviation (4.5 units), confirming the late-fall floor previously identified. Black Friday (late November) and the December holiday season are approaching, which often triggers a significant demand spike for lingerie and apparel. Although the recently observed demand is low (~33 units), the immediate proximity to the holiday season warrants a more responsive forecasting approach rather than relying on a long historical average or just the recent floor. I will use EWMA with a gamma of 0.4 to allow the forecast to rise quickly if a Black Friday surge begins this period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Entering holiday season (late Nov/Dec): Demand floor of ~33 units (P36-P41) may shift rapidly due to seasonal gifting/promotions.

This confirms our expectation of a seasonal surge in the lingerie category as we enter December. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time has consistently been 0, I will keep L at 0. To capture the current holiday upward trend without overreacting to a single spike, I will use an EWMA with a gamma of 0.7 to prioritize the most recent information (the jump to 68) while acknowledging the previous low-volume baseline. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat set to a higher value (30) to account for the increased volatility typically seen during December retail peaks and to ensure a higher service level during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 68 units, a 106% increase over the late-fall average of 33 units (P36-P41), coinciding with the start of December.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season. Demand for this bralette surged from a late-fall baseline of ~33 units to 68 units in P42 (Date: Nov 25) and 98 units in P43 (Date: Dec 2), representing a 196% increase from the prior floor. This confirms a significant seasonal trend associated with December. Stockouts occurred in both P42 and P43 due to this rapid acceleration. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during the peak weeks of December, I will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' forecast that reflects this holiday surge. Given demand jumped from ~30s to ~70 to ~100, I anticipate demand for Period 44 to likely exceed 100 units. I will set mu_hat (which covers 1+L = 1 period) at 120 units and increase sigma_hat to 35 to account for the high volatility observed during historical peak periods (e.g., June/August peaks).

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak acceleration: Demand increased from 33 (P41) to 68 (P42) to 98 (P43), confirming a steep seasonal climb for December (+196% over late-fall baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3382.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak holiday season (mid-December). Demand has accelerated exponentially over the last three periods: 68 (P42), 98 (P43), and a massive surge to 232 (P44), causing consecutive stockouts. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the product description (lingerie/bralette) and the date (Dec 16), we are likely at or very near the seasonal peak. History shows a previous peak in late August where demand reached ~196 units before cooling, but this holiday surge has already surpassed that level. Given the stockout in P44 at 232 units, the 'true' demand is likely higher. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 260 to account for potential unobserved demand and the proximity to Christmas. Sigma_hat is set to 50 via 'explicit' to handle the high volatility seen in these peak shifts. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Extreme holiday peak confirmed: Demand surged from 98 (P43) to at least 232 (P44), representing a 136% increase and resulting in a total stockout. This exceeds the previous summer peak of 196.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3177.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the December holiday season (Dec 23). Historical data shows a massive demand surge starting in Period 42 (68 units), accelerating in Period 43 (98 units), and peaking in Period 44 (232 units). Period 45 demand remains high at 176 units. This product (a lace push-up bralette) is a typical high-demand item for the gifting and holiday season. While Period 45 demand (176) is lower than Period 44 (232), it is still significantly higher than any non-summer or non-holiday baseline. Given that Period 46 is Dec 23 (just before Christmas), we expect high immediate demand followed by a potential post-holiday drop in Period 47. However, to avoid stockouts in this volatile window, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P42-P45) which capture the entire holiday climb and peak (avg 143.5 units). Current on-hand is 167. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this high-volatility, high-volume regime while the backend calculates the safety stock necessary for the high profit margin ($19 vs $1 cost).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak reached in P44/P45: The December holiday surge peaked at 232 units (P44) and remains high at 176 units (P45), averaging 143.5 units over the last 4 weeks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-Christmas/late December period (P47, 2019/12/30). Historical demand shows a significant holiday peak that has now begun to taper from a maximum of 232 (P44) down to 176 (P45) and 151 (P46). Given that the holiday gifting season has passed, I anticipate demand will continue to moderate back toward pre-holiday levels, which were significantly lower (~34 units in November). To avoid excess inventory while maintaining a safe service level for any remaining New Year's or winter clearance demand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P44-P46) average of 186 units to ensure sufficient stock for one more potential high-demand week, while sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the high volatility of the holiday surge). Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Post-holiday demand decline observed. Demand dropped from 232 (P44) to 151 (P46), a 35% reduction from the peak, indicating the end of the December surge.
