Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 1 (2019-02-11), we have 5 historical demand samples: 97, 79, 82, 148, 102. The mean is 101.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 27.8. The product is a 'Bella waistbelt', which is a fashion accessory. Given the current date is Feb 11, we are approaching the Valentine's Day period, which might explain the spike to 148 in late January and consistently decent demand. Promised lead time is 0. Since this is the first period, internal inventory is empty. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand distribution. L is set to 'default' (0). The OR backend will compute the base stock using these parameters to meet the target service level based on the $4.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed demand was 54 units, which is significantly lower than the historical samples provided (range 79-148, mean 101.6). This suggests a possible downward shift in demand as we move deeper into February. The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed in Period 1 (ordered 125, arrived 125). I will use a conservative approach for the demand forecast. Since we only have one period of live data (P1=54) alongside historical samples, I will use recent_N with N=3 to blend the recent low demand with the previous historical points to avoid overreacting to a single low data point while still acknowledging the downward trend. This results in a mu_hat based on (1+0) * mean(54, 102, 148) = 101.3. I will keep L at default (0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 is a 'Bella waistbelt'. We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25), approaching early March. Historical demand data from early January to early February shows an average of 101.6 units per week. However, the first two periods of the game (Feb 11 and Feb 18) showed lower demand of 54 and 45. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). My on-hand inventory is 96. Given the discrepancy between earlier historical peaks (e.g., 148 on Jan 28) and the recent low demand, I will use recent_N to forecast demand based on the more conservative recent observations while still accounting for the historical mean to prevent stockouts if demand reverts. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to encompass the last 3 units of game history plus the tail of historical samples, balancing recent trends with the higher Jan values.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a women's waist belt. Promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirm the actual lead time is consistently 0. Historical demand samples (97, 79, 82, 148, 102) and recent in-game demand (54, 45, 35) show a downward trend compared to the initial samples. The average of all available samples (8 total) is approximately 80 units, while the average of the last 3 periods is only 44.6. Given the transition from late winter to early spring, demand for this accessory appears to be cooling off significantly. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and avoid overstocking, as inventory has been accumulating (ending on-hand is 86, which is twice the recent average demand).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Bella waistbelt'. Historically, demand samples provided were: 97, 79, 82, 148, 102 (Mean ~101.6). However, in-game demand for Periods 1-4 has been 54, 45, 35, and 14 respectively. This shows a significant downward trend or a difference from the initial seed data. Since the product is an accessory (belt), there isn't an obvious major spike for March 11, though we should be wary of spring fashion shifts. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for P1, P2, and P3. For Period 4, the order was 0, so no arrival was expected. Current on-hand is 72. Given the declining demand (last 4 periods average 37), the current on-hand inventory should cover the immediate demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower in-game demand levels compared to the pre-game samples, and use the calculate method for L as the lead time has been stable at 0.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Bella waistbelt. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, as evidenced by successful arrivals in Periods 1, 2, and 3. Demand analysis shows a significant downward trend following the initial samples. The early samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~101 units/week, but the last 5 periods (since Feb 11) have seen demands of 54, 45, 35, 14, and 11, respectively, showing a clear regime shift toward lower demand as the season progresses past the early year peak. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend without being overly skewed by the high initial Jan values. On-hand inventory is 61, which currently covers several weeks of the current low demand, so the OR backend will likely recommend a small or zero order to reduce holding costs while maintaining the high service level required by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected after 2019-02-11: Average demand dropped from >100 units to <32 units over the last 5 weeks.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/03/25). Reviewing historical demand, there was a significant regime shift starting around Period 4. The initial training data and first two weeks (Period 1-2) showed demand averaging 80+, but the last three weeks have seen demand fall to 14, 11, and 37 (average ~21). The product is a wide waist belt, and the late March timing may indicate a post-winter seasonal dip or transition. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by periods 1, 2, and 3. On-hand inventory is 24, which currently covers roughly one week of the recent average demand. To minimize holding costs while protecting against the slight uptick seen in Period 6 (37 units), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples, which captures the lower regime (avg 20.67), and sigma_hat using the same period to reflect the higher relative volatility in this low-volume state. The OR engine will then decide if an order is needed to meet the base stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 (Bella waistbelt) has experienced a significant demand regime shift. Pre-period 1 demand averaged ~100 units, but from Period 1 to Period 7, demand dropped to an average of 32.7 units (54, 45, 35, 14, 11, 37, 13). Specifically, the last four periods (March onwards) show an even lower average of 18.75 units. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the post-shift average while smoothing the high volatility observed in Period 6. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held across Period 1, 2, 3, and 7 (lead time 0 evidenced in all arrivals), so I will use the default lead time. No units are currently in transit, and on-hand inventory is 20, which is roughly equal to one period of the recent demand average. By sets mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the lower current demand level while maintaining a safety buffer for the intermittent spikes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-08. Demand for the Bella waistbelt has shifted significantly downward since mid-February. Pre-February demand averaged ~100 units, but from Period 1 to Period 8, the demand sequence is [54, 45, 35, 14, 11, 37, 13, 10]. The most recent 5 periods (Periods 4-8) show an average demand of approximately 17 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 35 units, which covers more than two weeks of current demand. I will set L to 0 based on observed history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 4-8) and prevent excessive inventory accumulation while maintaining a buffer against the moderate volatility seen in Period 6.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's waistbelt. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift: early data (Jan/Feb) had demand averages ~100+, but since mid-February (Period 1 onwards), demand has significantly dropped and stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last 9 periods, the average demand is 24.8, with the most recent 5 periods (Periods 5-9) averaging only 15.2 units. The current on-hand inventory is 30 units, which covers approximately two periods of recent average demand. The promised lead time is 0, and all observed lead times have consistently been 0. Given the low holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), but very low recent demand, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment and avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer. No shipments are missing.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/04/22). History shows a stable actual lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The SKU is a 'Bella waistbelt'. A significant demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 6 (mid-February), where demand dropped from an initial average of over 100 to a much lower level. Looking at the last 10 periods of data (since Period 1), demand has been: 54, 45, 35, 14, 11, 37, 13, 10, 5, 23. The mean of these 10 periods is 24.7 units. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (Periods 6-10), demand is 17.6 units. Given the low on-hand inventory (7 units), there is a risk of a stockout if demand reverts toward the recent mean or spikes. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced view that respects the recent lower demand while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the volatility observed (e.g., the jump from 5 to 23 last period). L is set to 'default' as 0-period lead time is consistent.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Bella waistbelt) has transitioned to a significantly lower demand regime since February. Comparing the pre-February average (approx. 101 units/week) to the recent history (Periods 1-11), the demand has averaged approximately 25 units/week. Specifically, looking at the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11), demand has been 13, 10, 5, 23, and 36, averaging 17.4 units. The recent uptick in demand (last two periods) suggests a potential stabilization or slight recovery within this lower regime. Given the promised lead time L=0 is consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period), I will set L to 'calculate'. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent fluctuations while respecting the current lower-demand context. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the current volatility of this regime. Current on-hand is low (3 units), so this will trigger a replenishment order based on the new mean.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) following a stockout in Period 12, where demand (43) exceeded the available inventory (28). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand has shown a significant upward trend over the last three periods (23, 36, and 43), recovering from the lower regime mentioned in the carry-over insights. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet the rising trend and prevent further stockouts. The backend will calculate the base stock using the current profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), targeting an 80% service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increasing: Average demand over the last 3 periods (P10-P12) rose to 34 units, up from an average of 15 units between P4-P10.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Bella waistbelt' is currently in Period 14 (May 13). Demand has shown a distinct upward trend recently. Period 10-13 demand values are 23, 36, 43, and 34, averaging approximately 34 units per period. This is significantly higher than the low-demand trough observed in March/April (approx 15 units/period). I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this current demand regime (Periods 10-13). Although the promised lead time is 0 and historical arrivals have consistently confirmed L=0, I will use 'calculate' for L to remain robust. The OR engine will use these parameters to target a service level based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 9 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 10: Average demand increased to approx 34 units/period (Periods 10-13), compared to 15 units/period (Periods 4-9).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Bella waistbelt) has experienced a sustained demand regime shift since Period 10 (2019/4/15). The average demand from Period 10 to Period 14 is approximately 34.4 units per period (23, 36, 43, 34, 36), compared to the prior lower demand period. The current 'on-hand' inventory is only 5 units, which is significantly below the current weekly demand. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To meet the higher demand and prevent stockouts (as seen in Period 12), I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this 34-unit average. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this new regime and lead time 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observation for Period 15 (2019-05-20) shows a significant spike to 105 units, far exceeding the recent average of ~35 units established since Period 10. This product is a 'Bella waistbelt', and late May often sees a surge in accessory sales for summer fashion or late spring events. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all recorded arrivals. Based on the demand history from Period 10 onwards (23, 36, 43, 34, 36, 105), there is a clear upward trend culminating in a significant spike. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this regime shift while heavily weighing the recent high demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to account for the increased volatility introduced by the Period 15 spike. The goal is to set a high enough base stock to capture these larger demand events without over-ordering excessively if it was an outlier.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected at Period 15: Demand jumped to 105 units from a stable 34-unit average (Period 10-14), suggesting a new high-demand seasonal regime or peak event.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 (Bella waistbelt) has entered a significant high-demand regime since Period 15. Previous demand leveled around 34-36 units, but the last two periods (P15 and P16) saw spikes to 105 and 93 units respectively, coinciding with the late May/early June seasonal transition. The system has experienced stockouts in both periods despite ordering based on the previous regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 observations where orders were placed. To capture the current high-demand surge and prevent further stockouts, I am applying the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the trend starting from P14 (just before the surge) through the peak. This will significantly increase the base stock level to match the ~100 unit/period requirement.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Period 15-16 average demand is 99 units, a nearly 3x increase from the P10-P14 average of 34 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history for the 'Bella waistbelt' shows highly volatile demand. After a significant surge in Periods 15 (105 units) and 16 (93 units), Period 17 saw a sharp decline to 28 units. This volatility makes predicting the next period difficult. The carry-over insights correctly identified a high-demand regime, but Period 17 suggests this 'seasonal peak' or 'event' may have been short-lived or entered a lower-intensity phase. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 82 units on-hand and an average demand of approximately 75 units over the last three weeks (105, 93, 28), I will use a recent_N window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures both the extreme peaks and the most recent drop (P14: 36, P15: 105, P16: 93, P17: 28), providing a balanced forecast (average ~65.5). This approach helps protect against another sudden spike while accounting for the recent deceleration, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a two-period peak (P15-P16 avg: 99), demand dropped sharply in P17 to 28 units, indicating the surge was a transient event or has concluded.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 experienced a high-demand surge in Periods 15 and 16 (avg. 99 units), which immediately dropped back toward the previous baseline in Periods 17 and 18 (28 and 17 units respectively). Currently, on-hand inventory is 82 units, which is quite high given the recent drop in demand. To prevent further unnecessary stock accumulation while the demand stabilizes, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to average the two peak periods and the two low periods (approx 60 units), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for this high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression confirmed: Following the Period 15-16 surge (avg 99), Period 17-18 demand returned to lower levels (avg 22.5), suggesting the peak has concluded.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

The recent demand surge (Period 15-16, avg 99) has clearly concluded. Demand in the last three periods (P17-P19) has averaged 26 units (28, 17, 33), aligning with the regime observed between Periods 10-14 (avg ~34). Current on-hand inventory is 66 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately two periods of the current demand level. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by history. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this post-surge stabilization and prevent overstocking, while keeping L at calculate to reflect the standard 0-period lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand peak observed in Periods 15-16 (avg 99 units) has clearly subsided. Since Period 17, demand has stabilized at a lower level with a 4-period average of 26.5 units (28, 17, 33, 28). This aligns with the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 19 noting a regression to a lower demand regime. The current on-hand inventory of 38 units is sufficient to cover approximately 1.5 periods of demand at this rate. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period). I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current post-surge environment, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that prevents over-ordering while maintaining availability for the current demand level.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Bella waistbelt) ended Period 21 with 0 on-hand inventory due to a significant demand spike (76 units), which followed a period of lower demand (around 30 units). This spike likely corresponds to a mid-summer seasonal peak (early July), which carries over into the current period (July 8th). Historically, lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To meet this heightened demand and restore inventory levels, I will adjust mu_hat using 'recent_N' over the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21), which captures the baseline and the recent surge (Avg: 36.4). Combined with the 0-period lead time, this will trigger the OR backend to place an order sufficient to cover the current period's expected demand while maintaining a buffer. I will use 'recent_N' (N=5) for sigma_hat as well to account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge detected: Period 21 demand spiked to 76 units, interrupting the previous low-demand regime (avg 26 units from P17-P20).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 (Bella waistbelt) is currently experiencing a summer demand surge. Following a spike to 76 units in Period 21 (July 1st), Period 22 demand reached 83 units (July 8th). This confirms a transition from the lower mid-summer regime (approx. 26 units) to a high-demand peak, likely driven by summer event/festival season or clearance activities. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit, following a stockout in Period 22. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maximize profit during this surge and avoid further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent two-period average (approx. 80 units). Given the high volatility observed during previous surges (e.g., May peaks), I will use a larger N for sigma_hat or an explicit value to ensure the base stock covers potential demand spikes while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand surged to an average of 79.5 units over Periods 21-22 (July 1-8), compared to the prior 4-week average of 26.5 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand summer peak, as confirmed by carry-over insights and recent history (P21: 76, P22: 83, P23: 63). The average demand over these last 3 periods is approx 74 units, which is a significant increase from the June average of ~26 units. Given the transition from early July peaks into late July, I expect a slight normalization but still elevated levels compared to the spring. Leading time consistently remains 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 41 units with 0 in-transit. To ensure high service levels during this volatile period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus the OR engine on the current summer regime, while keeping L at the default (0) as evidenced by the consistent 'lead_time was 0 periods' in the game history.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Bella waistbelt' is currently in a summer peak regime that has sustained for 4 periods (P21-P24). The average demand during this surge is approximately 74.5 units per period (76, 83, 63, 76), which is a significant increase from the prior late-June average of ~26 units. Given the date is now July 29, we should anticipate this summer accessory demand to remain elevated but potentially start tapering as the season progresses. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this current summer demand level accurately. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to capture the volatility of this high-demand period, as the standard deviation has increased compared to the stable low-demand periods previously observed. These parameters will ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the ongoing summer peak while respecting the higher risk of holding inventory.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime confirmed (P21-P24): Avg demand approx 74.5 units, up from P17-P20 average of 26.5 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P21-P25) has stabilized at a higher level than the early summer average, with mean demand around 70 units (P21: 76, P22: 83, P23: 63, P24: 76, P25: 51). The average over this 5-period window is 69.8 units. Although P25 showed a slight drop to 51, the overall pattern suggests the high-demand summer regime is still active. Inventory is currently at 31 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility summer phase while allowing the slight downturn in P25 to temper the forecast slightly. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~70 units and protects against the observed variability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (wide waist belt) is currently in a sustained summer high-demand regime. Analyzing the demand from Period 21 to Period 26, we see a mean demand of approximately 68.3 units (76, 83, 63, 76, 51, 61), which is significantly higher than the spring average. The current date is 2019-08-12, indicating we are still in the summer peaks for fashion accessories. Since Period 21, demand has stayed consistently between 51 and 83 units. To capture this specific regime, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=6 (covering Periods 21-26). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to account for the variance in this specific summer window. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L is set to calculated average (0). On-hand inventory is currently low (20), so the backend needs to order to replenish for the upcoming period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P21-P26): average demand approx 68.3 units, significantly higher than P17-P20 average of 26.5 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Wide waist belt) is currently in a sustained summer demand regime. Since Period 21 (early July), demand has consistently averaged approximately 67 units (ranging from 51 to 83). The most recent demand (Period 27) was 64 units, confirming this higher plateau remains active as we move into mid-August. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable 0-period performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand behavior specifically within this high-demand summer regime (Periods 21-27). This ensures the base stock calculation targets the current mean of ~67 units rather than being diluted by early-year low-demand data, thus maintaining a high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (wide waist belt) is currently in a sustained high-demand summer regime. Since Period 21 (early July), demand has averaged approximately 70 units per week (P21-P28: 76, 83, 63, 76, 51, 61, 64, 86). The most recent demand (P28) was 86 units, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The current date is 2019/8/26, which is late August; while the summer peak may begin to taper soon, the last 8 periods demonstrate a consistent level of elevated demand compared to the spring months. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and maintain high service levels (critical given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this specific summer regime accurately. L is set to calculated as lead times have been 0 consistently.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P21-P28) confirmed: Average demand sustained at ~70 units/period, significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime of ~26 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bella waistbelt has been in a sustained high-demand summer regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 29, the average demand has been approximately 71 units per period (642 total units / 9 periods). The most recent two periods (P28 and P29) show even higher levels at 86 and 83 units respectively, indicating that the summer peak has not yet tapered off as of late August. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To capture this sustained regime while remaining responsive to the slight upward trend in the last few weeks, mu_hat will be set using recent_N with N=9 (the length of the current regime). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers these higher demand levels. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to reflect the volatility seen during this summer peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' is currently in a high-demand summer regime that began around Period 21. Recent demand (P28-P30) has intensified, averaging 89 units per period (86, 83, 98), compared to the earlier summer average of ~70. This suggests a peak-of-summer or back-to-school surge. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time consistently at 0 periods, I need to ensure the base stock covers the anticipated high demand for the next immediate period (Review + Lead = 1 period). Since the most recent 3 periods show a sustained higher level than the previous 7-period average, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike and prevent stockouts. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified further starting Period 28: 3-period average increased to 89 units, compared to the P21-P27 average of ~68 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 (Bella waistbelt) is currently in a sustained high-demand summer/early autumn regime. Since Period 28, demand has intensified, with the last four periods showing demand of 86, 83, 98, and 74 units (average 85.25). The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift at Period 28 where the average increased to approximately 89 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this most recent high-demand intensity (Periods 28-31) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals in the same period), so L is set to 'default'. Current on-hand is 22, targeting a stock level that covers ~85 units plus safety stock to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 28-30.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime confirmed starting Period 28: 4-period average demand is 85.25 units, significantly higher than the previous Summer regime average of ~68 units (P21-P27).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 28 (late August). Over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged 83.2 units per period (86, 83, 98, 74, 75), which is a significant increase from the mid-summer average of ~68 units. The product is a 'Bella waistbelt', which likely sees steady or increasing demand towards the autumn fashion season. All historical orders have consistently arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, including the most recent periods. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-intensity regime (avg 83.2). Since lead time is consistently 0, L=0 is appropriate to minimize holding costs while the base stock covers one period of demand.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime confirmed starting Period 28: 5-period average demand is 83.2 units, up from the P21-P27 Summer average of ~68 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bella waistbelt (589748001) has entered a high-intensity phase starting from Period 28 (Aug 19). The most recent period (P33) saw a significant surge to 142 units, the highest recorded demand in the history. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P28-P33) is 93.16 units, which is a marked increase over the Summer regime (P21-P27) of ~68 units. Given this recent escalation and the stockout in P33 (where demand of 142 was only partially met by 92 units), I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture this current high-demand regime. This provides a forecast of (1+0)*93.16. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-intensity demand regime confirmed starting Period 28: Average demand increased to 93 units (P28-P33), significantly exceeding the previous Summer regime average of 68 units (P21-P27).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-intensity demand regime that began around Period 28 (late August) continues into early October. The average demand from Period 28 to 34 is approximately 91.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P34) was 83 units, confirming that demand remains significantly elevated compared to previous periods. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels while tracking the current high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the data since the start of this specific high-intensity shift (Period 28). This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the current average demand of ~92 units and its associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P28-P34) remains stable: 7-period average demand is 91.5 units, compared to the summer average of 68 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 589748001 (Women's waistbelt) is currently in a sustained high-intensity regime that began around Period 28 (late August). Over the most recent 8 periods (P28-P35), the average demand is 89.4 units per period, significantly higher than the previous Summer regime (avg ~68.3). Recent weekly demand figures (86, 83, 98, 74, 75, 142, 83, 74) show high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 22), particularly due to the spike in Period 33. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. Given the current date is mid-October and demand remains strong, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this regime accurately while maintaining a buffer for volatility using recent_N for sigma_hat.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Bella waistbelt) has entered a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 28 (late August). The average demand from Period 28 to Period 36 is approximately 91.1 units per period, which is significantly higher than the previous summer average of ~68 units. Recent demand samples show 83, 74, and 84 units, indicating the regime is stable. The current inventory is 25 units on-hand with zero in-transit. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue to use L=0. I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9, covering Period 28 to Period 36) to capture the current high-intensity regime accurately, and sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same range to account for the observed volatility, including the spike to 142 in Period 33.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P28-P36) remains stable: 9-period average demand is approximately 91.1 units, compared to the previous summer average of 68 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 (Bella waistbelt) is in a high-intensity demand regime that began around Period 28 (late August). The average demand from Period 28 to Period 37 is approximately 91 units per period (samples: 86, 83, 98, 74, 75, 142, 83, 74, 84, 108). Most recently, in Period 37, demand spiked to 108 units, causing a stockout as starting on-hand was 107. The actual lead time consistently confirms the promised lead time of 0 (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). To maintain high service levels and capture this sustained demand, I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime characteristics. Lead time L is set to 'default' as 0-period arrivals are consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P28-P37) confirmed: 10-period average demand is 90.7 units with high volatility (max 142), significantly higher than the previous Summer average of 68 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 is in a sustained high-intensity demand regime that began around Period 28. Over the last 11 periods (P28-P38), the average demand is approximately 92.9 units per period (compared to the previous summer average of ~68). The most recent demand (P38) was 115 units, following 108 units in P37, indicating the trend remains strong as we enter November. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To ensure we capture this high demand while accounting for volatility (max of 142 observed), I am using lead time L=0, setting mu_hat based on the last 11 periods of the current regime (N=11), and sigma_hat also based on the last 11 periods to capture the increased variance (standard deviation in this window is ~20-22). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for the next period.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P28-P38) sustained: 11-period average demand is 92.9 units (range 74-142), significantly higher than the previous Summer average of 68 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 is currently in a sustained high-intensity demand regime that began around Period 28 (mid-August). For the last 12 periods (P28-P39), the average demand has been 92.3 units per period. The most recent demand was 86 units, following a peak of 115. While there is significant volatility (standard deviation remains high), the mean is stable around the 92-unit mark. Current inventory is 25 units, and actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level), I will use the last 12 periods (N=12) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entire current high-demand regime. This provides a balance between responding to the recent level shift and managing the high variance observed in this period (e.g., the 142 and 115 spikes).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 is in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 28. Over the last 13 periods (P28-P40), the average demand has been approximately 92.2 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 19.3 units. The most recent demand (Period 40) was 91 units, which is consistent with this regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for a reactive ordering strategy. Given the date is mid-November, we remain in a potential high-demand season for fashion accessories like waist belts. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock covers the high volume while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance. Inventory is currently low (19 units), so the OR backend should trigger an order to replenish up to the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P28-P40) sustained: 13-period average demand is 92.2 units (range 74-142), significantly higher than the previous Summer average of 68 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (wide waist belt) is in a stable, high-intensity demand regime that began around Period 28 (late August). The average demand over the last 14 periods (P28-P41) is approximately 91.5 units, with a slight cooling observed in the most recent period (68 units). Given the current date is November 25, 2019, we are entering the peak holiday shopping season, where demand for accessories often remains high or spikes. Although Period 41 was lower, it remains within the expected volatility of this regime (range: 68-142). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting L to 'default' (0). To capture the current high-demand regime while allowing for the recent slight softening and volatility, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the regime from P28 onwards). This ensures the base stock reflects the sustained high volume observed over the last three months rather than the much lower historical averages from spring and summer.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 is currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 28, which has intensified recently. Most notably, Period 42 (late November/Cyber Week context) saw a massive demand spike to 187 units, the highest in the history of the game. This spike suggests a significant seasonal peak associated with year-end sales events. The average demand for the last 15 periods (P28-P42) is approximately 98.5 units, but the last 3 periods average 115 units. Given the transition into early December, I expect demand to remain at these elevated levels or slightly higher. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels during this critical peak while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach (N=15) to capture the high-regime average while manually adjusting mu_hat via explicit method to 150 units to account for the current upward momentum and the observed 187-unit peak, ensuring the OR engine's 'cap' does not prematurely truncate necessary stock. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 40 to account for the high volatility seen in the recent 187 and 142 unit spikes.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand spike detected Period 42: Demand reached 187 units (highest peak), confirming a late-year intensification of the existing high-demand regime (P28-P42 average: 98.5 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final weeks of 2019 (December). Historical demand analysis shows a standard high-intensity regime starting in Period 28 (avg ~92), followed by a massive seasonal spike in Period 42 (187 units), likely associated with Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Period 43 demand dropped back to 67 units. Historically, the high-demand regime (P28-P41) had an average of approximately 92 units. However, given the extreme volatility (spike to 187) and the proximity to the end of the year, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=16 to capture the high-intensity regime (starting P28) while factoring in the recent volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory (117) and the OR backend's target service level (based on a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio) will properly scale the order to cover potential pre-holiday surges without excessive carrying cost.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year seasonal spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 187 units (+100% vs regime average), followed by a return to moderate levels (67) in Period 43.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the final stages of a high-demand end-of-year regime. Demand reached a massive peak in Period 42 (187 units) but has since corrected to 67 units (P43) and 90 units (P44). The 'High-intensity demand regime' starting at Period 28 is the most relevant baseline, with a mean of ~92 units. However, given we are in the peak holiday shopping weeks (mid-December), demand is likely to remain elevated above the summer/autumn average or exhibit high volatility. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. I will use the recent_N method with N=17 (covering the shift at Period 28 through Period 44) to capture the current high-demand distribution while accounting for the recent holiday volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the immediate pre-Christmas week. Historically, specifically in Period 42 (late November), we saw a major peak (187 units). Since then, demand has stabilized between 67-90 units (average 77.7 over the last 3 periods). Given the 'Wide waist belt' product description, we are likely in a high-demand gifting season, though we may see a slight drop-off post-Christmas (Period 46/47). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the immediate post-spike stabilization level, resulting in an expected demand of ~78 units. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher volatility seen during the end-of-year peak period to maintain a sufficient service level.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, representing the final week of the year and the transition into early January. Historical data from early 2019 (P1-P3) shows demand between 35-54 units. Over the last 4 periods (P43-P46), demand has softened from the late-November peak (187 units in P42) and stabilized at an average of 73 units (67, 90, 76, 59). Given the end of the holiday season and the start of a more conservative demand regime observed in previous winter months, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this post-holiday stabilization. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 57, which is close to the most recent demand of 59, justifying a replenishment order to maintain service levels for the upcoming week.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Average demand (P43-P46) has stabilized at 73 units after the P42 peak of 187 units.
