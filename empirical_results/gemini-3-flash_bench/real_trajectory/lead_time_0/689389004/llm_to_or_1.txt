Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand samples show a significant upward trend: starting from 56-60 units in early January and hitting 107 units in the most recent period (Feb 4). This suggests a positive demand regime shift, likely due to spring/post-winter transition for this viscose blouse. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is promised at 0, I will set mu_hat to capture this recent increase. I'm using N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to weigh the most recent high-demand periods (82, 71, 107) more heavily than the earlier January data. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility associated with this shift. Lead time (L) is set to 'default', as we have no historical arrivals yet to suggest deviations from the promised 0-period lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed lead time was 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 86 units, following a trend of increasing demand (from 60 to 107 in the historical samples provided, though the most recent sample before the game was 107 and Period 1 came in at 86). Given the product description (viscose shirt, long sleeves) and the February date, we are in a transition period towards spring. The historical mean of all samples including Period 1 is 77. Standard deviation is roughly 18. Setting L to default (0). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the last 4 historical samples + Period 1) to capture the upward trend seen in the historical data while acknowledging the slight dip in Period 1. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' is a straight-cut viscose shirt from the Divided Collection. Current date is 2019/02/25. Historical demand samples (before P1) showed a moderate range (56-107), but Period 2 experienced a significant spike to 151 units, coinciding with the typical late February/early March transition toward spring fashion and potentially early spring break shopping. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, due to the stockout in Period 2 (81 units sold out of 151 demanded), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to accommodate this higher demand regime. I will use a recent_N method for both mean and standard deviation to capture the recent high volatility and demand increase. N=5 is chosen to balance the pre-game samples with the most recent observed spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019-02-18 (Period 2): demand spiked to 151, significantly higher than the previous 5-week average of ~75. This suggests a seasonal shift for 'Garment Upper body / Shirt' items.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4 (2019-03-04), we are managing SKU 689389004 (Viscose Shirt). The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the history of Periods 1, 2, and 3 where orders arrived in the same period they were placed. Demand history shows a baseline of ~73 (initial data) followed by a massive spike to 151 in Period 2, then a stabilization to 78 in Period 3. Given the product description (viscose shirt, long sleeves) and the March date, we are entering the spring transition where demand for lighter layers often increases but remains volatile. The spike to 151 suggests potential for high peaks, but the return to 78 indicates that 151 was likely an outlier or a temporary stock-up event. To balance the high holding cost (equal to profit), I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent shift (avg of 151, 78, and the current trend) while preventing over-ordering from a single outlier. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=6, including historical data) to ensure the variance calculation accounts for the high volatility seen in Period 2, protecting against stockouts during similar spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand for the 'Denise Shirt' showed stability around 75 units in early 2019, followed by a significant spike (151 units) in mid-February (Period 2), and a subsequent decline to 78 and 62 units in late February/early March. The spike in Period 2 appears to have been an isolated event rather than a sustained regime shift, as the last two periods (P3: 78, P4: 62) are closer to the earlier average of ~75. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 43 units on-hand. Given that Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which translates to base stock = mu_hat. To prevent over-inventorying after the spike, I am using the last 3 samples (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the recent trend (97 avg) while still factoring in the spike's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 2 proved temporary; demand has returned to a lower range (60-80 units) in Periods 3 and 4.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (Denise Shirt) experienced a significant demand spike in Period 2 (151 units), which the system previously identified as a potential seasonal shift. However, over the last three periods (P3-P5), demand has stabilized at a lower level: 78, 62, and 57 respectively. The average demand across these last three periods is approximately 65.6 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Based on the profit/holding cost ratio ($1/$1), the target cycle service level q = 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand. Using N=3 for mu_hat will focus on the most recent post-spike regime, while using a larger N=6 for sigma_hat (including the spike) provides a prudent buffer against the volatility observed in Period 2, ensuring the backend doesn't underestimate potential variability during this seasonal transition into March.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization: Demand has converged to a range of 57-78 (avg ~66) over Periods 3-5, confirming the Period 2 spike was an outlier or a very brief peak rather than a sustained shift.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/03/25. Historically, lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory reached 0 in Period 6 due to a demand of 81 outstripping starting on-hand (66). Recent demand has stabilized after an earlier spike: Period 3-6 demand values are [78, 62, 57, 81], averaging 69.5. Including the pre-spike data from Jan/Feb (60, 56, 82, 71, 107), we see a consistent baseline between 55 and 85, excluding the Period 2 outlier (151). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time. Mu_hat will use the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture the post-spike stabilization period (mean ~70), and sigma_hat will use the same N=4 to capture current volatility without being skewed by the outlier spike in Period 2. The backend will target a 50% service level (Profit vs Holding cost are both $1.0), which is appropriate given high holding costs relative to profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a significant increase in Period 7 (117 units) following a period of stabilization (averaging ~66 units in Periods 3-5) and a moderate rise in Period 6 (81 units). The product, a viscose shirt, is likely entering a spring seasonal peak as we enter April. In-transit and on-hand inventory are currently zero, so we need to capture this upward trend immediately. Using recent_N with N=3 for demand parameters will prioritize the recent uptick (81 and 117) and the pivot point (57) while smoothing the earlier spike from Period 2. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use N=3 to capture the most recent regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 6/7: Average demand increased from ~66 to ~100 as seasonal spring demand for viscose shirts accelerates into April.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' (a viscose shirt) is experiencing a sustained seasonal demand increase as we move into April. Over the last three periods (Periods 6, 7, 8), demand has been 81, 117, and 141 respectively, significantly higher than the earlier baseline (avg ~66). The last two periods specifically show we are stock-out constrained, as ending inventory hit 0 and demand (117, 141) exceeded units sold (70, 85). We have successfully confirmed that the lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed arrive in the same period). To address the recent trend, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 to capture this upward shift in demand while maintaining a high service level through the OR backend's natural safety stock calculation. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the target service level q is 50%, but since the OR policy is capped at a 95% service level visibility, providing an accurate mean for the last 3 periods (average ~113) will allow the system to order sufficient stock to meet the rising Spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive periods (P6: 81, P7: 117, P8: 141) compared to the previous average of 66. This aligns with seasonal demand for viscose shirts in April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for SKU 689389004 (Viscose Shirt) has been highly volatile, peaking at 141 in Period 8 before dropping to 72 in Period 9. My carry-over insight correctly identified a seasonal uptick from Period 6-8, but Period 9 shows that the extreme peak was not sustained. April demand for lightweight viscose shirts is generally strong but fluctuates based on early spring weather. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, which I will maintain. Given the stockouts in Periods 6, 7, and 8 followed by a high-demand drop in Period 9, I will use a recent window (N=4: Periods 6-9) to capture the current spring demand regime while moderating the extreme peak. This period's inventory (on-hand 41) needs to be supplemented to cover anticipated demand of ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a viscose shirt, which typically sees high demand in late spring (April/May). Recent history shows a significant demand surge in Periods 6, 7, and 8 (81, 117, 141), which then cooled off in Periods 9 and 10 (72, 62). However, looking at the full history and seasonal context (late April), we are likely in a high-demand regime compared to the early year (Feb/Mar). The zero lead time has been consistent across all 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 41. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10) to capture the recent spring demand levels while acknowledging the slight cooling in the last two weeks. This averages to approximately 94.6 units per period. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 will capture the high volatility (from 141 to 62) observed in this regime. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.00), suggesting a target service level (crityical ratio) of 0.50, though the OR backend's inventory cap logic will also apply.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' (Viscose Shirt) is currently in a spring demand phase. Analysis of the last 6 periods (Period 6 to Period 11) shows a distinct shift with an average demand of approximately 94 units (81, 117, 141, 72, 62, 90). This is higher and more volatile than the mid-March stabilization period. The current date is April 29, 2019, heading into May; while spring peaks often occur in April, demand usually remains elevated before the summer transition. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. In Period 11, the ending inventory was 5 units. To ensure high service levels during this volatile spring phase, I will use a recent_N window of 6 to capture the mean (\u03bc\u0302) and variance (\u03c3\u0302) since the regime shift that began in Period 6. This allows the backend to calculation a base stock that covers the expected 90-100 unit demand while accounting for the high volatility seen in early April.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility demand regime confirmed from Period 6 to Period 11 (2019/3/18 - 2019/4/22), with an average demand of 93.8 units compared to the previous stabilization average of 66.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (viscose shirt) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 6 (2019/3/18), aligning with spring seasonality. Over the last 7 periods (P6-P12), demand has averaged 89.14 units, though it remains volatile with a standard deviation of approximately 30.7. The most recent demand (P12: 61) was lower than the regime average, but still significantly higher than the early February baseline. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Since starting on-hand is low (33 units) and demand is volatile, I will use a recent_N (N=7) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current seasonal regime and ensure the base stock is high enough to prevent stockouts while reflecting the recent average demand of ~89 per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-20.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 13: 35) is significantly lower than the April peak (Period 8: 141), suggesting the 'spring' rush for this viscose shirt may be cooling off as we enter mid-May. The average demand over the last 8 periods (since the start of the high-demand regime in Period 6) is 82.375 units, but the most recent 5 periods show a decline (72, 62, 90, 61, 35) with an average of 64 units. Given that Profit equals Holding Cost ($1.00 each), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. I will use recent_N (N=5) for the demand forecast to capture this downward trend while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to use. On-hand inventory is 55 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand sample of 35.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 13: Demand dropped to 35 units, falling below the previous 'high' regime range (61-141) and returning closer to early-period stabilization levels, suggesting the end of the spring seasonal peak.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P13: 35, P14: 31) confirms a significant downward regime shift compared to the high-demand spring period (avg ~94). This aligns with the 'Garment Upper body / Shirt' category seasonality as we move past the spring peak. The stabilization at a lower level (~31-35) suggests we should update our forecast using a smaller window of the most recent observations. N=2 is too small, so I will use N=3 (P12: 61, P13: 35, P14: 31) to capture the trend while providing a slightly more conservative buffer. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The Profit and Holding cost are equal (1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: Average demand decreased from ~94 (P6-P12) to ~33 (P13-P14), representing a late-spring seasonal cooling for blouses.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' (a viscose blouse) is currently in a distinct 'low' demand regime following a seasonal spring peak. Demand has consistently dropped over the last three periods: P13 (35), P14 (31), and P15 (25), suggesting it is moving out of peak season as June approaches. The average demand during this new regime (P13-P15) is approximately 30 units, a sharp contrast to the previous peak average of ~94. To maintain high service levels while minimizing holding costs (which equal profits, suggesting a 50% critical ratio), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this lower regime. Observed lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods, which I will reflect by using the default lead time setting and recent_N for averages.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 689389004 (Viscose Shirt) has entered a clear downward regime shift starting Period 13 (2019/5/6). Historical demand for the last four periods (P13-P16) has been consistently low: 35, 31, 25, and 17, with an average of 27 units. This represents a significant decline from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~94). The current date is June 3, 2019, which suggests we are past the spring seasonal peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime. I am keeping L at 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~94 (P6-P12) to ~27 (P13-P16) as the spring seasonal peak for blouses concluded.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a low-demand regime that began in Period 13 (2019/05/06). Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has ranged from 17 to 35 units, with a mean of 27.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 7.2. This confirms the decline from the earlier spring peak (avg ~94). The current date is 2019/06/10, entering the summer season where demand for this 'Straight-cut shirt' appears consistent with these lower levels. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 0 units in-transit. Given equal profit and holding cost ($1.00), the target service level is 50%, roughly equivalent to the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this latest regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful same-period arrivals.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved viscose blouse. Demand analytics show a significant and sustained regime shift starting at Period 13 (May 6). The previous 'high' regime (P6-P12) averaged 93.8 units/period, whereas the current 'low' regime (P13-P18) has dropped to an average of 24.3 units (35, 31, 25, 17, 27, 11). This decline matches the expected seasonal lifecycle for a long-sleeved shirt as summer starts. In Period 18, demand reached a new low of 11. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (Holding Cost = Profit = $1.0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this current low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets the ~24 units per period average rather than the historical highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~94 (P6-P12) to ~24 (P13-P18) as the summer season begins and interest in long-sleeved viscose blouses declines.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (viscose shirt) is currently in a low-demand regime that began around Period 13 (early May). Demand has averaged 25.0 units over the last seven periods (P13-P19) and 19.3 units over the last three periods (P17-P19). This shift reflects the transition into the summer season, where demand for long-sleeved shirts typically declines compared to the spring peak. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (which equal profit per unit) while maintaining a sufficient service level for this lower but slightly volatile demand (recent demand: 27, 11, 19), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this specific low-demand regime since P13. This filters out the high-demand data from March and April.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved viscose shirt, which is experiencing a sustained low-demand regime following its spring peak. In the last eight periods (P13-P20), demand has averaged approximately 23.1 units, significantly lower than the ~94 units seen during the spring peak. The most recent demand (P20: 17, P19: 19, P18: 11) confirms this stabilizing low trend. To reflect this current regime and avoid overstocking while holding costs equal profit ($1.0 each), I am using a recent_N window of 8 periods for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so I will stick to the default lead time setting.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 21) spiked to 46 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 8-week average (P13-P20) of approximately 23 units. This suggests either a mid-summer clearance event or a brief resurgence in interest for 'Straight-cut shirts'. However, with on-hand inventory at 0 and a profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the optimal base stock is the median of expected demand. Looking at the last 9 periods (P13-P21), demand values are: 35, 31, 25, 17, 27, 11, 19, 17, 46. The mean of this recent regime is approximately 25 units. While the Period 21 spike is notable, one data point is insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift back to high demand. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this recent low-demand stabilization while giving some weight to the recent uptick. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 ('DENISE SHIRT S.0') is experiencing a new demand surge. Since Period 21 (July 1st), demand has spiked to 46 and 60 units, significantly higher than the low-summer average of ~24 discovered at Period 13. This likely corresponds to mid-summer sales or clear-out events. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%. However, because we have hit zero inventory for two consecutive periods, we must aggressively adjust parameters to capture this new volatility. I am choosing N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to prioritize the shift observed in Periods 20, 21, and 22. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Demand increased from ~24 to ~53 units (+120%) over the last two weeks, suggesting a mid-summer peak for shirts.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a mid-summer demand phase. Demand spiked to 46 and 60 in Periods 21 and 22, but settled back to 33 in Period 23. The carry-over insight from Period 23 notes a regime shift at Period 21 with avg demand increasing to ~53. However, with the most recent observation of 33, a more conservative recent mean is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs, as Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, leading to a target service level of 50%. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the increased demand from Period 21-23 while allowing the more recent lower value to influence the forecast. Lead time consistently remains 0 as observed in every past period (N-Z=0).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in Period 25 (late July). Looking at the recent demand history, there was a brief mid-summer spike in Periods 21 and 22 (demand of 46 and 60), which has since cooled down in Periods 23 and 24 (demand of 33 and 27). This suggests the late-July demand is stabilizing around a mean of ~30-40 units. Since Period 21, the market regime has shifted from the very low June levels (~18) to a slightly higher summer level. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current summer regime (Periods 21-24), which yields an average demand of 41.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will maintain L=0. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the current demand level without overstocking as we move towards August.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a mid-to-late summer phase. After a brief demand peak in Period 21-22 (~53 avg), demand has softened over the last three periods (P23-P25) to an average of 30.3 units (33, 27, 31). This indicates the 'mid-summer peak' mentioned in Carry-over Insights was temporary. The current inventory position is 11 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 0 and actual lead times consistently being 0, the backend should focus on the most recent demand regime (last 3-5 periods) to set base stock levels. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the average of the recent peak and the subsequent cooling (avg ~39), providing a buffer for volatility while avoiding overstocking as we move further into August.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer peak in Periods 21-22 (avg ~53) has subsided; demand for Periods 23-25 has stabilized at a lower average of ~30 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the viscose shirt (689389004) has recently stabilized after a mid-summer peak. In Period 26 (2019/8/5), demand was 41, which is higher than the average of the preceding three weeks (~30), potentially indicating the start of a late-summer/pre-fall bump. Historically, demand for this item is volatile. Since the inventory is currently 0, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to meet current demand levels while considering the unit profit/holding cost ratio (1:1), which implies a target service level of 50% in the backend OR calculation. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the behavior of the last month (P23-P26: 33, 27, 31, 41), which averages ~33 units. This period is mid-August, approaching the transition to autumn where long sleeves might see renewed interest. Setting L=0 as consistently observed.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a late-summer/early-autumn demand phase. Recent history shows demand has climbed from the stable ~30 units (Periods 23-25) to 41 (Period 26) and 59 (Period 27), suggesting a potential ramp-up as consumers look for long-sleeved viscose blouses for the transition into fall. The item is currently out of stock (Ending Inventory = 0) following a demand of 59, which exceeded the order of 33. The promised lead time remains 0 and has consistently been 0 in practice. To capture this rising trend while protecting against the volatility seen in the last two weeks, I will use a recent window (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the transition from the stabilization phase (avg 30) to the current higher demand levels (avg ~38 across the last 5 periods), providing a balanced base stock for the OR controller to compute the next order.

Carry-over insight: Demand ramp-up observed starting Period 26: demand increased from stable ~30 units to an average of 50 units over Periods 26-27, potentially indicating early fall seasonal interest.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (viscose shirt) is exhibiting a clear late-August demand ramp-up, likely associated with the 'Back to School' or early fall season. Demand has risen consistently over the last three periods: P26 (41), P27 (59), and P28 (79). This confirms the 'early fall seasonal interest' noted in the previous carry-over insight. Using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat specifically targets this upward trend (average ~60), while a slightly longer window (N=5) for sigma_hat captures the increasing volatility (ranging from 31 to 79). The observed lead time remains stable at 0 periods, but stockouts in the last three periods (ending on-hand = 0) indicate the OR backend's previous parameters were too conservative for this growth. By setting N=3 for mu_hat, I aim to provide the backend with a base stock level that covers this higher demand regime and prevents further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand ramp-up confirmed: Demand has increased for three consecutive weeks (P26: 41, P27: 59, P28: 79), signaling the start of a fall seasonal regime with an current average of 60 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. We are in a confirmed fall seasonal demand ramp-up for the Denise Shirt, which is a long-sleeved viscose blouse. Looking at the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has been 41, 59, 79, and 51, averaging 57.5 units. While Period 29 showed a slight dip (51) from Period 28's peak (79), it remains significantly elevated compared to the mid-summer average of ~30. Based on seasonal logic for a long-sleeved shirt entering September, I expect demand to remain in this higher range or continue to grow. To capture the current regime while allowing for recent growth, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The confirmed lead time remains 0 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'DENISE SHIRT S.0' (soft viscose shirt) has definitively entered a fall seasonal regime. Since Period 26, demand has consistently been higher than the summer trough (Period 26: 41, Period 27: 59, Period 28: 79, Period 29: 51, Period 30: 66), averaging 59.2 units per period compared to the previous ~30 units. The most recent demand (Period 30) of 66 units confirms this elevated level continues into September. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 0, I need to set base stock levels to capture this new mean. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the average of the current fall regime (59.2) and for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (std approx 14). Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal regime confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~59 units over Periods 26-30, up from the summer trough of ~30 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a confirmed fall seasonal regime. Since Period 26 (August 5), demand has increased from a summer trough of ~30 units to a higher range of [41, 51, 51, 59, 66, 79], with an average of approximately 58 units over the last 6 periods. The most recent demand (P31) was 51 units. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. Historical data from early Spring (Periods 6-12) suggests that demand for this type of blouse can reach averages of ~94 units, so shielding against current volatility is important. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which the backend will calculate. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, but I will use the 'calculate' method to ensure any occasional drifts are captured by the OR backend's historical processing where possible.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a 'Fall seasonal regime' which began around Period 26 (August 5). Since then, demand has stabilized at a higher level than the summer trough. Specifically, over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), demand values have been 41, 59, 79, 51, 66, 51, and 64, resulting in an average of approximately 58.9 units per period. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) have shown consistent demand levels (66, 51, 64) with an average of 60.3. This confirms the stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. Historically, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same-period), so I will maintain L=0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the entirety of this fall regime shift while smoothing out the weekly fluctuations (sigma_hat also uses N=7 to reflect this regime's volatility). This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current seasonal 'plateau' for viscose shirts as we move further into September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 is currently in a 'fall seasonal regime' that began around Period 26 (August). Demand has been consistently higher than the summer trough, with the most recent Period 33 showing a spike to 87 units. Over the last 8 periods (P26-P33), demand has averaged 62.3 units with significant volatility. Recent demand for 'Straight-cut shirt' items typically increases as autumn progresses. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this fall regime's average, while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the recent high volatility (87, 64, 51, 66) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal regime strengthening: Average demand for Periods 26-33 is 62.3, up from the summer average of ~30. Recent demand (P33) hit a local peak of 87 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (viscose shirt) is currently in a fall seasonal regime. Since Period 26 (August), demand has increased from a summer trough of ~30 to a fall average of ~64 units. Specifically, over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), demand values have been 41, 59, 79, 51, 66, 51, 64, 87, and 44, yielding a mean of 60.2 and a standard deviation of 15.8. The most recent demand (P34) was 44, following a peak of 87 in P33, suggesting continued volatility within this regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized but volatile fall demand while ensuring sufficient stock for potential weekly peaks (like the 87 observed in P33), I will use the last 9 periods (N=9) to calculate parameters. This balances the recent seasonal shift against short-term fluctuations.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' is a long-sleeved viscose shirt. Historical demand analysis shows a fall seasonal regime started around Period 26 (August), with demand averaging approximately 62 units through Period 33. However, the last two periods (P34: 44, P35: 31) show a noticeable cooling in demand, departing from the 50-80 unit range seen previously. This suggests the peak of the fall interest may be subsiding as we move into mid-October. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'concluded' messages (P34 and P35 arrived on the same period they were ordered). I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand parameters to capture the fall regime while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting N=10 covers the timeframe from Period 26 onwards, effectively weighting the current seasonal environment. With both profit and holding cost at $1.0/unit, the backend targets a 50% service level, essentially aiming for the mean demand. Current on-hand is 30 units, which is close to the most recent demand (31), so a modest order is expected to replenish stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed starting Period 34: after a fall peak averaging ~62 units (P26-P33), demand dropped to 44 and 31 in P34-P35, suggesting the end of the primary fall sales window for this item.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '689389004' (viscose shirt) has entered a clear cooling phase following a sustained fall regime. Demand over the last three periods has dropped significantly (P34: 44, P35: 31, P36: 26) compared to the previous fall average of ~62. This aligns with the seasonal transition out of early fall shirt demand. Given this cooling trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower volume (averaging approx. 33.6 units) and avoid over-ordering into late October. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 32 units, which nearly covers the expected demand for the current period, so the OR backend should generate a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Average demand for Periods 34-36 has dropped to 33.7 units, a ~46% decrease from the fall peak average of 62.3, signifying the end of the fall seasonal peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'DENISE SHIRT' has significantly cooled following the fall peak. The regime shift identified in Period 36 and confirmed in Period 37 shows demand dropping from a peak average of ~62 units to a much lower level (P34: 44, P35: 31, P36: 26, P37: 32). This confirms the end of the fall seasonal window. For Period 38 (Oct 28), I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new 'cooling' regime. The calculated average for the last 4 periods is 33.25. Setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the inventory policy reflects the current lower demand and reduced volatility, avoiding excess holding costs for a product that is now out of season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 689389004 (viscose shirt) has definitively cooled following the fall peak, as noted in the carry-over insights for Period 37. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has been 44, 31, 26, 32, and 23 units, respectively, with a clear downward trend towards stabilization. The average demand over these 5 periods is 31.2 units, which is significantly lower than the fall average of ~62 units. Given the seasonal nature of the product (viscose shirts, long sleeves), we expect demand to remain at these lower levels as we enter November. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on all historical data. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this lower stabilizer, and setting sigma_hat using the last 8 periods to ensure enough volatility coverage to minimize stockouts during this transition while controlling holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 34-39) confirms a sustained downward shift following the fall peak. Demand values for the last six periods are 44, 31, 26, 32, 23, and 14, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 28.3 units. This aligns with the 'cooling' phase identified in the carry-over insights as the season transitions into late autumn/winter. Given that lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I am setting L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture this current cooling regime (P34-P39) while excluding the previous high-demand fall peak. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the lower current demand, minimizing holding costs while still covering the observed volatility in this lower range (standard deviation ~10.4).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this item (Denise Shirt, a soft viscose blouse) has been steadily declining as the weather turns colder, confirming a transition into a winter trough. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has dropped from 26 to 9 units, with the most recent three periods (P38-P40) averaging only 15.3 units. Given the seasonality of a 'viscose weave' shirt, demand is expected to remain low until the next spring cycle. As the promised lead time remains 0 and orders have consistently arrived on time, I will set L to 'default'. To avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase and minimize holding costs, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average 18.8) and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (P36-P40). This ensures the base stock reflects the current cooling trend while maintaining a slim buffer for minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Demand has dropped below 25 units for three consecutive periods (P38: 23, P39: 14, P40: 9), averaging 15.3 units. This marks a deeper winter cooling phase compared to the previous 'cooling' average of 33.7 units in Periods 34-36.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 689389004 (soft viscose shirt) is currently in a deep winter cooling phase. At Period 41, the demand remains low at 12 units, following a trend of 23, 14, and 9 units in the preceding weeks. The average demand over the last four periods (P38-P41) is 14.5 units, which is significantly lower than the previous cooling average of ~34. Given that are heading into December, demand for light viscose shirts is expected to stay low until after the holiday season or until early spring previews appear. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this sustained low-interest period. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level (q) is 0.5, essentially aiming for the median demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the viscose shirt (SKU 689389004) has entered a stable low-demand regime characteristic of the winter season. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 14.2 units, which is a significant drop from the fall average of ~62. Period 42 showed a demand of 13, continuing this trend. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation and on-hand inventory at 2 units, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5-period average (N=5) to avoid overstocking during this low-sales phase. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 42 conclude'.

Carry-over insight: Winter stabilization confirmed: Average demand for Periods 38-42 has stabilized at 14.2 units, confirming a consistent low-demand regime for the winter season.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/9 (Period 44). We are in a confirmed winter low-demand regime. Average demand since Period 38 (starting 2019/10/28) has been 14.6 units (23, 14, 9, 12, 13, 17). The last period (P43) saw a slight uptick to 17 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show an actual lead time of 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while recognizing the low seasonal demand for a viscose blouse in December, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture this winter regime (Periods 38-43). The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on this low mean and variance. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock will effectively target the median demand (plus safety stock for variance) to balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/16 (Period 45). The product is a long-sleeved viscose shirt, which is currently in a winter low-demand regime. Average demand for the winter period (P38-P44) has been 14 units. Recent demand samples are: P40=9, P41=12, P42=13, P43=17, P44=10. This confirms a stable, low-volume pattern. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this specific winter regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time is consistently 0, and all shipments have arrived within the same period (L=0), so I will maintain the default lead time setting. On-hand inventory is 5, with 0 in-transit. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on a recent 14-unit average, ensuring we cover immediate demand while minimizing holding costs for this slow-moving period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 689389004 (viscose shirt) is currently in a stable winter low-demand regime. Since Period 38 (late October), demand has consistently remained below 25 units, with the most recent five periods (P41-P45) showing demand of 12, 13, 17, 10, and 14. This confirms the 'Winter stabilization' insight noted in the carry-over history. The mean demand for these last 5 periods is 13.2 units with a relatively low standard deviation. As the current date is December 23rd, we are in the peak of the winter season where demand for this type of long-sleeved shirt is expected to remain consistent and low until the early spring transition (historically seen around Period 6/February). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. Therefore, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable winter regime statistics starting from Period 38 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintaining L at the promised lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-30. The product is a soft viscose shirt, which has shown a clear seasonal low during the winter months (November-December). Demand has been extremely stable in a low regime since Period 38. Over the last 9 periods (P38-P46), demand has averaged 14.3 units with very low volatility (standard deviation ~4.3). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by every successfully concluded period in the history. I am setting L=0 and using a recent_N approach (N=9, covering the entire winter stabilization period) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current low-demand environment. This ensures we carry minimal inventory into the new year while still meeting the consistent demand of ~14 units observed throughout December.
