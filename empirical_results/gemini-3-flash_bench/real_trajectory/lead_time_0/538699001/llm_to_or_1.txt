Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this 'V-neck strap top' shows an upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 98, 95, 128, 120, and most recently 190 on 2019-02-04. As an 'Everyday Basic' but with a 'V-neck strap' design, it is likely entering a spring seasonal ramp-up. The most recent demand (190) is significantly higher than the previous 4-week average (~110). Given the promised lead time of 0 periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent acceleration (averaging 128, 120, 190) which results in a more responsive mean of 146 per period. Since L=0, (1+L) equals 1, meaning mu_hat will effectively be 146. This prepares the inventory for the observed demand growth while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit margin.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the product (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top), we see a significant demand spike in the most recent periods. Historical demand from Jan to early Feb averaged 126 units (98, 95, 128, 120, 190). However, Period 1 demand reached 292 units, occurring in mid-February. This likely represents the start of early spring/warm-weather demand for basic tops. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on Period 1's conclusion (ordered 179, arrived 179). We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Given the sharp upward trend, I will use recent_N with N=3 for the demand components to capture the recent acceleration (120, 190, 292) while maintaining the Lead Time at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1051.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck strap top. Historically, demand was around 100-130 units in January, but spiked significantly in February (P1: 292, P2: 265). This likely represents a seasonal transition into spring/summer basics or a specific promotion. Since actual lead time is confirmed as 0 (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived immediately), I will use L=0. For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods (Feb 4th pre-game sample through P2) show a sustained higher regime (190, 292, 265). I will use the last 3 samples (P1, P2, and the 190 sample) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3. This captures the current high-demand trend while acknowledging the volatility observed during the P1 spike. This setting ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated sales velocity while managing the holding cost of $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: Mean increased from ~110 to ~250+ (approx. +125% increase).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck strap top (Everyday Basic). We are in Period 4 (early March). Since February, we have observed a significant demand regime shift. Historical samples (pre-Period 1) averaged ~108, but the last three periods (Period 1-3) show demands of 292, 265, and 194, averaging ~250. This represents a +125% increase compared to the initial baseline, likely due to early spring seasonality for this basic 'vest top' category. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this higher-volume regime while acknowledging the slight cooling in Period 3 (194). Setting L=0 explicitly to match the observed actual lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck strap top (Basics), and we are in early March. Historical data showed a significant demand surge in February compared to January (January mean ~110 vs. February mean ~225). In the most recent four periods (concluded Period 1 to Period 4), demand has been 292, 265, 194, and 168. While demand has softened slightly since the mid-February peak, it remains well above the January baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting L=0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high-demand Spring regime (avg 229), as the full history including January would underestimate current needs. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the higher volatility of this current regime. These parameters ensure the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the expected 200+ units of demand for the current period while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck strap top. Historically, demand spiked in February (avg ~212 units/period across Periods 1-5) compared to January (avg ~126 units/period). However, looking at the most recent three periods (P3-P5), demand has stabilized at a lower level (194, 168, 150) averaging 170.6 units, suggesting the initial February spike is cooling off as we transition into mid-March. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend from the peak, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility of the higher-demand regime. This keeps the base stock responsive to the tapering demand while maintaining enough safety stock for the high variance observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed in March: Mean decreased from Feb peak (~275 in P1-P2) to ~170 in P3-P5 (-38%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The product is a women's V-neck strap top (Everyday Basic). Historical demand shows a significant spike in February (Period 1: 292, Period 2: 265), followed by a taper in early March (Period 3: 194, Period 4: 168, Period 5: 150). However, Period 6 showed a sharp rebound to 233 units, resulting in a stockout (sold out 223 available units). This rebound might be driven by spring seasonality as we reach late March. Observed lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all 6 periods. Given the stockout and the recent upward shift in demand (P6=233 vs recent avg ~170), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent mean (approx 184) while accounting for the sudden spike. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the increased volatility observed in the last period. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover this expected demand plus a safety factor for the 0-period lead time environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound observed late March (Period 6: 233) following a 3-period decline, suggesting potential spring seasonal volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering April (Period 8) for a women's V-neck strap top. Historical demand shows a significant spike in February (avg ~240) followed by a dip in early March (avg ~160), and a recent resurgence in late March (Period 6: 233, Period 7: 248). Given the item is a 'Jersey Basic' vest top, demand is likely increasing as we transition into spring/summer seasons. In the last two periods, we stocked out (ending inventory zero) and sold all available units, meaning actual demand (233, 248) exceeded our starting inventory. Lead time is consistently 0. To capture this upward trend and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent demand from the last 2 periods to establish a higher base forecast (approx. 240 units/period). Setting N=2 for mu_hat specifically targets this recent rebound.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand growth confirmed: Late March (P6-P7) demand averaged 240 units, a 50% increase over the early March average of 160 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/08. The product is a Women's V-neck strap top (Basics), which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Demand has shown a significant upward trend over the last three weeks: 233 (P6), 248 (P7), and 313 (P8), averaging 265 units. The most recent demand (313) is significantly higher than the training data or early March levels, confirming the seasonal growth noted in the Carry-over Insights. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, meaning we are starting from scratch to meet this period's demand. To avoid further stockouts (which occurred in P6, P7, and P8), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the accelerating spring demand regime. Lead time remains 'default' at 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained spring demand acceleration: 3-week average reached 265 units (P6-P8), with P8 hitting a peak of 313, confirming a high-growth regime compared to mid-March.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'V-neck strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which experiences seasonal demand growth heading into spring/summer. Currently, Period 10 is 2019/04/15. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting in Period 6 (late March), with the last four periods (P6-P9) averaging 258.5 units (233, 248, 313, 240). This is a substantial increase compared to the early March average of ~160 (P4-P5). Although demand dipped slightly from P8 (313) to P9 (240), it remains high relative to previous months. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments have successfully concluded with an actual lead time of 0. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this sustained spring growth regime while keeping \u03bc\u0302 high enough to prevent further stockouts (which were observed in P6, P7, and P8).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'V-neck strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which experiences high spring seasonality as demonstrated by the Carry-over insights and historical peaks in late March/early April (P8: 313 units). Period 10 demand was 202, showing a slight cooling or fluctuation from the P8 peak, but still significantly higher than the early March mean (~160). As we are in late April (P11), steady demand is expected before the likely transition into summer peaks. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. To balance the service level (profit $4 vs holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (average of P8-P10: 251.6) to capture the current elevated spring regime while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N=3 to account for the high variance observed in this growth phase.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top', which is highly seasonal towards late spring and summer. History shows a major growth regime starting in late March (P6-P8), peaking at 313 units in P8. However, the last three periods (P9-P11) have shown a steady decline in demand (240, 202, 175). This suggests a temporary post-peak cooling or a local fluctuation before a potential May/June summer surge. Since promised and actual lead times are consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. To respond to the recent three-week downtrend while maintaining enough safety stock for a potential seasonal rebound, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat (averaging 228.6 units) to capture the broader late-spring trend (P7-P11) rather than just the most recent low of 175. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the high volatility observed during April.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed throughout April: Weekly demand decreased from a peak of 313 (P8) to 175 (P11), a 44% decline over 4 weeks.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'V-neck strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which typically sees demand growth as temperatures rise in spring (May/June). Reviewing the history: Period 12 showed a bounce-back in demand to 211 units from a previous low of 175, following a decelerating trend throughout April. With the date being May 6th, we must balance the recent downward trend against the expected late-spring/early-summer seasonal lift. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To capture the recent demand stabilization and anticipate a potential May uptick, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window (N=5) which averages approximately 188 units per week. With L=0, (1+L) * 188 = 188. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture recent volatility (approx. 25-30 units). On-hand inventory is 69 units, so an order targeting this base stock level should suffice to meet current demand while minimizing holding costs if growth remains moderate.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand stabilization and potential seasonal pivot observed. After a 4-week decline in April (313 to 175), demand rose to 211 in P12 (late April/early May), suggesting the end of the post-Easter dip and the start of pre-summer seasonality.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'V-neck strap top', a summer-season basic. Current date is May 13, 2019. Historical demand shows a peak in early April (313 units in P8), followed by a decline, and recent stabilization (166-211 units in P12-P13). As we move deeper into May, pre-summer demand is expected to remain steady or rise. The last 5 periods (P9-P13) provide a stable recent group with a mean of ~199 units, which better represents current demand than the full history or the volatile March/April peaks. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time (L=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $661.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699001 (V-neck vest top) is entering late May (Period 15), moving into peak summer seasonality for 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Historical data shows demand stabilized between 165-215 units over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), with the most recent demand at 177. Looking at the broader calendar, May/June typically sees a significant rise in demand for lightweight jersey tops. I am setting mu_hat based on an N=4 recent regime (P11-P14 mean = 182.25) but explicitly adjusting for the expected summer uptick. The observed lead time is consistently 0 (ordered Period N, arrived Period N). To capture the impending seasonal growth while managing holding costs (profit to holding ratio is 4:1), I will use an explicit forecast that assumes a moderate baseline of ~210 units per period to ensure adequate stock for the upcoming warm-weather peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stabilization in May: Demand averaged 182 units over P11-P14 (late April/mid-May), successfully ending the April downward trend. Expected summer seasonal lift starting late May/June.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. We are entering the summer season for a 'V-neck strap top', which is a quintessential warm-weather item. Historically, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (15/15 periods). Demand in May (Periods 13-15) has stabilized after the April decline, showing 166, 177, and 216 units respectively (Mean = 186). Given the seasonal nature of the product, I anticipate a demand lift as June begins. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture the recent stabilization and slight upward trend, but use an explicit mu_hat to preemptively account for the expected summer seasonal increase. I'll estimate a 20% increase over the recent 3-week average (186 * 1.2 \u2248 223) to ensure high service levels for this high-margin basic.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal lift expected: Basic vest tops (Jersey) likely to see increased demand starting late May/early June. Period 15 demand of 216 units (up from 3-week avg of 186) supports this early trend.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. The product is a jersey V-neck strap top (Womens Everyday Basics), which is a highly seasonal summer item. Period 16 demand (late May) was 220 units, and Period 15 was 216 units, suggesting a stabilized and growing demand profile as we enter June. Historically, demand for this item sees surges in the summer. Based on the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the average demand is roughly 198 units; however, the last two weeks (P15-P16) averaged 218 units. Given the transition into June, I expect demand to increase towards the levels seen in early spring (P8-P10, avg ~250). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent seasonal lift while remaining responsive to potential summer surges, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to weigh the recent May/June transition most heavily while maintaining a safety buffer. This ensures the base stock reflects the current upward trend (avg of P13-P16 is approx 195, but expected to trend higher).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed: Late May/Early June demand is consistently exceeding 215 units per week (P15: 216, P16: 220), establishing a higher floor compared to the April/May average of 180 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. We are managing a V-neck strap top, a quintessential summer basic. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Demand in Period 17 (181 units) was lower than the previous two weeks (216, 220), but this is common for basic items which fluctuate around a seasonal mean. As we are now in mid-June, we are entering the peak summer season for women's jersey tops. While Period 17 showed a slight dip, the average demand of the last 3 periods is 205 units. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer regime while maintaining responsiveness to the recent slight dip and seasonality. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the 0-period lead time + the current period's demand (L+1=1), keeping safety stock high enough for seasonal spikes without over-investing in holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17. Demand in Period 18 dropped to 125 units from a stable 3-week average of ~200, which is unexpected for a summer-relevant item (V-neck strap top). However, looking at the history, this SKU exhibits periodic volatility (e.g., P3, P10, P13). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the transition into mid-June, I will not treat the P18 dip as a permanent downward regime shift yet, but rather as volatility. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current late spring/early summer average (avg of P15-P18: 216, 220, 181, 125 = 185.5) which safely bridges the shift. Setting L to default (0).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a 'V-neck strap top', a summer-dependent basic. Demand history reflects significant seasonality: a peak in late March/early April (Spring), followed by a dip in late April/May, and a recent stabilization in June. Since June 3rd (P17-P19), weekly demand has been 181, 125, and 204. While P18 was low, P19 showed a strong rebound to 204, confirming the 'Summer demand regime' identified in the carry-over insights where demand tends to floor around 180+. Observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To capture this summer volatility and avoid stockouts during potential late-June heatwave spikes, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P15-P19) to reflect the recent summer level (~189 units). Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the high variance observed in these last few weeks (ranging from 125 to 216).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 21 (July 1, 2019), we are evaluating a 'V-neck strap top', a staple summer garment. Recent demand shows significant fluctuations: 181 (P17), 125 (P18), 204 (P19), and 158 (P20). While there were high expectations for a 'summer surge', the average demand over the last four weeks (P17-P20) is 167 units, which is lower than the early June expectations. We are currently in peak summer, where demand for v-neck strap tops is expected to remain firm but volatile due to weather or promotions. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels for potential July heatwaves, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 185, slightly above the recent June average (167) to account for potential early July seasonality. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to cover the observed volatility (standard deviation of the last 4 periods is ~33).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand volatility observed: June demand (P17-P20) fluctuated between 125 and 204 (avg 167), failing to sustain the late May peak of 220, suggesting erratic summer purchasing patterns for basics.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 begins on July 8, 2019. The demand for Period 21 was unexpectedly low at 79 units, continuing a volatile and downward trend observed since late June (P19: 204, P20: 158, P21: 79). This aligns with the 'Mid-summer demand volatility' noted in the insights, where demand for this basic vest top is no longer sustaining the early summer peak. With on-hand inventory at 140 units and a observed lead time consistently at 0, the current stock covers nearly two weeks of the most recent demand level. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining/erratic market, I am shifting mu_hat to a more responsive estimate. Using recent_N with N=4 (covering the late June to early July period) captures the sudden drop to 79 while still accounting for the slightly higher preceding weeks. This balanced approach protects against further drops while maintaining enough stock if demand rebounds to the 150-160 range seen in mid-June.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand slump: Demand dropped significantly in early July (P21: 79), following a downward trend from mid-June (P19: 204, P20: 158), suggesting a potential end-of-season tapering for this basic jersey top.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'V-neck strap top' (a basic jersey vest top) has entered a significant downward trend as we move into mid-July. Last period's demand was 55, following a drop to 79 the week prior. This marks a sharp decline from the June average of ~167. Given the 'Womens Everyday Basics' category, we are likely seeing an end-of-season clearance phase or a peak-summer slump where initial summer buying has concluded. Current on-hand inventory is 131 units, which is already double the most recent demand. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs ($1.0/unit) during this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current decline (avg ~97). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The OR backend will likely generate a very small or zero order given that on-hand (131) exceeds the expected demand for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse confirmed mid-July (P21-P22): Average demand plummeted to 67 units (-60% vs June avg), signalling end of primary summer season for basic vest tops.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics V-neck vest top has entered a significant downward trend as the peak summer season concludes. Demand has dropped from a June average of ~167 units to 79, 55, and most recently 35 units in the last three periods (P21-P23), representing an approximate 80% decrease from the mid-summer peak. Given the current date of July 22nd and the nature of the product (a summer basic), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' strategy with N=3 to capture this rapid late-season decline. The promised lead time of 0 remains consistent. With 108 units on hand and demand plummeting, the goal is to prevent excess inventory accumulation during the end-of-season clearance phase while maintaining a small buffer for residual sales.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand collapse for summer basics: Demand dropped from ~160 (June average) to 35 (P23), a decrease of nearly 80%.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Basics Vest Top (Jersey) has significantly collapsed as the summer season ends. Following the late July plunge (Period 21: 79, Period 22: 55, Period 23: 35, Period 24: 23), we are now in an end-of-season regime. Current on-hand inventory is 85 units, which far exceeds the current 4-week average demand of ~48 units and the most recent demand of 23. To maximize profit and minimize holding costs for this leftover seasonal stock, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent downward trend (averaging approx 27 units). This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary new orders while we bleed off the current 85-unit surplus. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (V-neck vest top) has entered a clear end-of-season demand collapse as of August 2019. Demand has dropped from a June average of ~167 to a recent 3-week average (P23-P25) of just 25 units. Since this is an 'Everyday Basic' jersey top, demand is unlikely to disappear entirely but will remain at a low baseline throughout the late summer/autumn transition. With 68 units currently on-hand and demand trending downward (P23: 35, P24: 23, P25: 17), the current inventory covers nearly 4 periods of future demand. To avoid unnecessary holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this low-demand regime and prevent the OR engine from ordering more until the current surplus is cleared. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699001 (Jersey Basic Vest Top) has entered a post-summer low-demand regime, as established in the carry-over insights and confirmed by recent demand data. Demand for the last four periods (P23-P26) has been 35, 23, 17, and 27, averaging ~25.5 units per week. This is a significant drop from the spring/summer peaks of 200-300 units. Current on-hand inventory is 41 units, which is approximately 1.5-2 weeks of current demand. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (actual lead time 0), the OR backend's cap and base stock logic should prevent excessive ordering. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this low-demand state for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the system targets a base stock appropriate for the current ~25 units/week level rather than the historical average. This will likely result in a near-zero order to bleed off the remaining 41 units of inventory first.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck strap top', which follows a strong summer seasonal pattern. We are currently in mid-August (Period 28). Historical demand shows a significant collapse starting in July (dropping from a June average of ~167 to a July/August average of ~38). The last four periods (P24-P27) have shown stable but very low demand: 23, 17, 27, and 28. This averages to approximately 24 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 13 units on hand and 0 in-transit, we need to satisfy the current period's demand (approx. 24 units). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this established end-of-season low-demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to place a small order to cover the deficit and maintain a lean inventory, minimizing holding costs as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer low demand regime stabilized (P24-P27): Average demand is 24 units/period, down from peak summer levels, confirming a move to a baseline 'everyday basic' level or clearance phase.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699001 (Womens V-neck vest top) is currently in a low-demand, post-summer stabilization phase. Demand has remained consistently low over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), with values of 23, 17, 27, 28, and 18, resulting in a 5-period average of 22.6 units. This confirms the 'everyday basic' baseline level identified in the carry-over insights. Since the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead times have consistently been 0, I will maintain L at default. For forecasting, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this stable low-demand regime (mu_hat approx 23). Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) provides a tight volatility estimate (approx 5.1) appropriate for this stable phase, ensuring we maintain high service levels for this basic item while minimizing holding costs for a product that has clearly exited its peak seasonal window.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699001 (Womens Everyday Basic Vest Top) is currently in a stable low-demand regime following the summer peak. Since Period 24 (late July), demand has consistently hovered between 17 and 28 units per week. The last 6 periods (P24-P29) show a mean demand of 22.8 units with a low standard deviation (~4.5). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the 'Everyday Basic' nature of the product, I expect this baseline demand to persist into September. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this stabilized post-summer regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory remains lean to minimize holding costs while covering current sales levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' v-neck strap top. Following a massive peak in the spring and summer (reaching >300 units/week), demand has settled into a significant low-volume regime for the late summer/early autumn transition. Since Period 24, weekly demand has stabilized at a mean of 21.4 units (P24-P30: 23, 17, 27, 28, 18, 24, 13). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage inventory efficiently and avoid holding costs in this low-demand phase while maintaining the 80% service level target (based on $4 profit / $1 holding cost), I will use the last 7 periods (the start of the stable low-demand phase) as the forecasting window for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is a women's basic V-neck strap top (jersey), which has transitioned from a high-demand summer item to a low-volume fall baseline. Historical demand over the last 8 periods (P24-P31: 23, 17, 27, 28, 18, 24, 13, 11) confirms a stable 'everyday basic' regime with an average of approximately 20 units per week. The most recent two weeks (P30-P31) show even lower demand (13, 11), suggesting a potential further dip as weather cools. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this stabilized post-summer baseline (Period 24-31) while being sensitive to the recent downward drift. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect the reduced volatility of this low-demand phase.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a 'Women's Everyday Basics' jersey vest top. Demand has remained stable in a low-volume 'post-summer' regime. Since Period 28, demand has averaged 15.2 units per period (18, 24, 13, 11, 12). There is no immediate evidence of an autumn spike for this specific summer-oriented basic. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. With 14 units on hand and 0 in-transit, I am maintaining parameters to cover approximately 1-2 periods of demand to minimize holding costs while ensuring availability for the current stable baseline. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this stabilized low-demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a V-neck strap top (Womens Everyday Basic), currently in a stable, low-demand regime typical for the transition from late summer into early autumn (September). Since Period 28, demand has settled into a baseline level averaging approximately 15 units per period (P28-P33 range: 9-24). The inventory position is currently 12 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs for this low-volume period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-summer stabilization (Avg ~14.5, Std ~5.5). This will ensure the base stock covers the current low-demand environment without overstocking as we move further into the off-season.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a V-neck vest top (Everyday Basic), which has transitioned from a high-demand summer peak into a low-volume autumn baseline. Since Period 28 (late August), demand has stabilized into a very low and consistent regime. For the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has been 13, 11, 12, 9, and 9, respectively, resulting in a mean of 10.8 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given the stability of this 'Everyday Basic' at this time of year (October), I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture this stable low-demand tail, covering the period since early September. This ensures we maintain a lean inventory (on-hand is currently 11) while meeting the low, consistent demand without incurring excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand baseline confirmed since late August (P28-P34): average weekly demand is approximately 15 units, following the summer peak-to-trough transition.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a V-neck strap top (summer basic) currently in a low-demand, post-summer regime. Demand has stabilized at a very low level: since Period 28 (late August), the average weekly demand has been ~14 units, and since Period 33 (late September), it has settled further to ~10 units. Current date is mid-October, well into the autumn season for this jersey basic. On-hand inventory is 8 units, with no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a lean inventory and minimize holding costs while the item is in this low-velocity phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent stability (approx. 10 units/week). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is being met.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a V-neck strap top (Women's Jersey Basic), currently in a stable late-autumn low-demand regime. Since Period 30 (early September), demand has consistently remained in the 6\u201313 unit range, with the most recent sample (P36) hitting a period low of 6 units. The 3-period average is approx 8.7 units, and the 7nd-period average (P30-P36) is approx 10.4 units. Given this stability, I will use a window of N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand baseline without noise from the summer season. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699001 (Jersey Basic Vest Top) is in a stable, low-demand baseline regime following the end of its peak summer season. Since late August (Period 28), demand has been extremely low, averaging approximately 11.5 units over the last 10 weeks (P28-P37) and 8.4 units over the last 5 weeks (P33-P37). The current period is late October, a season typically associated with low demand for lightweight sleeveless vest tops. On-hand inventory is 3 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs for this low-velocity item, I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized winter-baseline demand pattern (~12 units/week) without being overly sensitive to single-digit fluctuations. Actual lead time has remained 0.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck strap top (Jersey). It has transitioned from a high-demand summer peak to a stable, low-demand winter baseline. The current date is early November (2019/11/04), which is well into the off-season for sleeveless vest tops. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) has been extremely stable, averaging 11.2 units with a standard deviation of 5.5. Recent demand in Period 38 was only 5 units. Given the 'Everyday Basic' nature, demand is expected to remain at this floor until a spring/pre-holiday shift. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this settled low-demand regime, ensuring we don't over-order based on earlier high-volume history.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a V-neck strap top (Womens Everyday Basics), which typically experiences its lowest demand during the late autumn and winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. Since Period 35 (early October), the demand has stabilized into a very low-volume regime, averaging approximately 8 units per week (P35-P39: 11, 6, 10, 5, 6). The current date is Nov 11, 2019, which is well into the low-demand winter season for this garment type. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this low-demand period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this stable winter baseline.

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime confirmed (P35-P39): Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 8 units per week, following the summer-to-autumn transition.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's V-neck strap top (a summer-oriented basic jersey item) has entered a stable low-demand winter regime as of Period 35. Over the last 6 periods (P35-P40), the weekly demand has averaged approximately 7.8 units (11, 6, 10, 5, 6, 9) with low variance. The current date is November 18, 2019, which is deep into the off-season for vest tops. On-hand inventory is currently at 1 unit with 0 in-transit. Given the lead time is 0, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=6 to capture this current low-demand baseline. This allows the OR backend to maintain a small but sufficient stock for the winter period while minimizing holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. The product is a Women's V-neck strap vest top, which is currently in a winter low-demand regime. Historical demand since mid-October (P36-P41) has been very stable, with values of 6, 10, 5, 6, 9, 8, averaging approximately 7.3 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. The target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, which the OR backend will calculate using my provided parameters. To reflect the most recent stable low-demand regime without being over-reactive to minor weekly fluctuations, I am using recent_N = 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the period desde early October).

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 538699001 (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top) is currently in a stable winter low-demand regime. Analysis of the most recent 8 periods (P35-P42) shows demand consistently ranging between 4 and 11 units, with a mean of approximately 7.4 units per week. The latest demand (P42) was 4 units. There are no immediate holiday spikes expected for this specific basic jersey vest top category in early December that would deviate from this baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect this established low-demand winter stability, while using the default lead time of 0.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck strap top' (Jersey Basic). Currently, in Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in a deep winter low-demand regime. Historical demand since Period 35 (early October) has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 7-8 units per week. Specifically, the last four weeks (P40-P43) have shown demands of 9, 8, 4, and 4. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we should maintain a small buffer, but with demand this low, the default 'recent_N' approach over the last 5 periods (N=5 covers P39-P43) will capture the current mean of 6.2 units and moderate variance appropriately. This prevents overstocking a summer-oriented basic during the winter trough while ensuring enough on-hand inventory to cover the typical 4-9 unit weekly range.

Demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) has been 9, 8, 4, 4, 4, averaging 5.8 units per week. This aligns with the 'Winter low-demand regime' identified in Period 40 carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is 5 units, which is close to the expected weekly demand. Given the stability of this low-demand phase during December, I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability (P38-P44) while smoothing for the minor fluctuations seen in late November.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. This SKU is a women's basic V-neck strap top (Jersey). Based on the historical demand data and carry-over insights, the product is in a sustained winter low-demand regime. Since Period 35 (early October), demand has consistently remained in the single digits or low teens, with a recent 5-period average (P41-P45) of only 4.4 units per week. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Given that it is currently the Christmas week (Dec 23), demand for basic summer-style vest tops is expected to remain at its absolute minimum baseline. I will use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the period since mid-October/P35) to capture this stable low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering during the off-season. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a lean inventory, minimizing holding costs while covering the very low expected demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck strap top (jersey basic), which is currently in its winter low-demand regime as confirmed in Carry-over Insight Period 40. Demand for the last 7 periods (P40-P46) has been extremely low: 9, 8, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1, averaging 4.5 units per week. This reflects typical post-holiday and mid-winter seasonality for a lightweight vest top. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (Holding Cost = $1.0 vs Profit = $4.0) during this stagnation phase, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this specific low-demand floor. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 7 periods to account for the reduced volatility at these levels.
