Historical demand shows an average of ~57 units per week, with a notable peak of 110 units in late January. Given the high profit margin ($19) compared to the low holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred to avoid stockouts. Since the promised lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive in time to satisfy Period 1 demand.

Recent periods (late Jan to early Feb) showed 34, 50, and 37 units. The outlier of 110 on 2019-01-21 suggests a potential promotional event or specific seasonal spike that has since normalized. I will project an average demand around 45-50 units to be safe. c) Lead Time: Confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 1). This allows for just-in-time inventory management. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 73 units. With lead_time=0, any order placed now will arrive before demand is resolved in Period 2. e) Order Logic: To maintain a target inventory level covering approximately 1.5 to 2 weeks of demand (given 0 lead time), I want to end Period 2 with roughly 50-60 units. Expected demand for Period 2 is ~45. Current inventory 73 - 45 = 28. To return to a safety level of ~60, I should order approximately 32 units. However, given the product's basic nature and the low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19), slight overstocking is safer than stockouts. I will order 35 units to ensure availability.",

Demand for lightweight outerwear typically remains stable or slightly softens during the late spring (late May) as temperatures rise, before hitting summer lows. Historical demand over the last 15 periods has averaged ~45 units/week, with recent weeks (P10-P15) showing a slightly lower but consistent average of ~39 units/week. Specifically, the last 4 weeks were 54, 40, 32, and 43. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current inventory is 42 units. Since the order arrives in the same period it is placed (L=0), I need to cover Period 16 demand (estimated at ~40-45 units). With 42 units on hand, I am perfectly positioned to cover the average demand, but I will order a small amount (38 units) to maintain a safety buffer for Period 17 and avoid stockouts if demand spikes back toward the historical average (~45-50).",
