Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU is a 'Nora T-shirt', an everyday basic item. Historical demand shows a downward trend: 78, 58, 47, 42, 40. This suggests the initial demand might have been a launch surge or a seasonal peak that is now stabilizing. The average of the last 3 samples is 43, while the overall mean is 53. Since demand is clearly shifting down, I will use recent_N=3 to prevent over-ordering. Initial inventory is 0, so the backend will place an order to reach the base stock level. Promised lead time (L) is 0. I will monitor for the actual lead time starting next period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a Women's T-shirt 'Nora T-shirt', part of 'Everyday Basics'. Historical demand shows a declining trend: 78, 58, 47, 42, 40. In Period 1, demand was 48, which is slightly higher than the most recent sample but consistent with stabilizing demand. On-hand inventory is 0 because demand (48) exceeded the initial order (43). The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time=0). To calculate parameters: mu_hat should reflect the recent stable trend (~45-50 units). Given L=0, mu_hat = (1+0) * forecast. Using the recent 3 samples (42, 40, 48) gives an average of 43.3. I will set L=0 and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stabilization rather than the early high-demand peaks in January.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/2/25. The product is a Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics). Analysis of historical demand (Jan: 78, 58, 47, 42; Feb: 40) versus the last two periods (Period 1: 48, Period 2: 120) shows a significant demand spike in Period 2. The 120 demand in late February likely signals a seasonal shift toward spring basics. Evidence from concluded periods 1 and 2 confirms the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently 0 after stockouts in Periods 1 and 2. To capture the recent demand surge and avoid further stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=2, focusing on the current seasonal uptick rather than the January cooling. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but the backend cap will help prevent excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed at Period 2: demand jumped from ~40-50 range to 120 (+150%), likely indicating seasonal spring demand for jersey basics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is a seasonal jersey basic. We observed a significant demand spike in Period 2 (120 units), followed by 77 units in Period 3. The carry-over insight noted a shift from ~45 to ~120, but Period 3 shows a moderation. Averaging the two high-demand periods (120 and 77) gives ~98.5. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. To avoid stockouts while managing the high $1.0 holding cost, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime using N=2 (mean of 120 and 77). I will also use N=2 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation is sufficiently responsive to the current trend.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is an everyday jersey basic. Current date is March 11. Historical demand showed a significant peak in Period 2 (Feb 18) at 120 units, followed by a decline to 77 and then 39. This suggests a highly volatile early spring demand pattern or a stock-out induced demand distortion in earlier periods. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units. With a lead time of 0 (confirmed by all 4 previous periods), the system can react instantly. Given the recent variability (120, 77, 39), a simple mean of the last 3 periods (approx 78.6 units) is a safer forecast than the long-term average which includes prehistoric very low values (40s). I will use recent_N=3 to capture the post-shift behavior while smoothing out the most recent drop, ensuring we have enough stock if demand bounces back toward the 80-100 range.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. Analysis of historical demand shows a peak in Period 2 (120 units) followed by a gradual stabilization (77, 39, 55). The product is a Nora T-shirt (Jersey Basic), which typically sees increased interest as spring approaches in March. Historical lead time records confirm that orders arrive in the same period (L=0). However, the initial demand samples (40-78) were lower than the recent spike. In Period 5, demand was 55, and the current on-hand inventory is 24. While Period 2 was an outlier, the 'recent_N' approach will better capture the current demand baseline compared to the full history which includes lower winter values. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to include the spike but heavily weight toward the recent normalization, and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed since Period 2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598001' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is currently in the spring season (late March). Demand history shows a significant spike in Period 2 (120 units), followed by a stabilization in the 40-77 range (average approx 55 over the last 4 periods). History confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. The previous Carry-over Insight noted a regime shift, but recent data suggests the extreme jump in Period 2 was either a one-time outlier or a very short-lived peak, as demand has settled back to moderate levels (39, 55, 47). I will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized post-spike demand while discounting the early low-demand weeks and the single outlier spike. This balances the need for stock against a high 1:1 Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio, which penalizes overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized after Period 2 spike: average demand from Periods 3-6 is approx 55 units per week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. The product is a soft jersey T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics), which aligns with typical spring/summer demand patterns as the weather warms. In Period 7, demand spiked to 83 units, exceeding the recent average of ~54 units (Periods 4-6). This suggests a potential new upward trend entering April. My Carry-over Insights note a stabilization at 55 units, but Period 7's jump to 83 units indicates we need to proactively adjust mu_hat to avoid stockouts, especially since on-hand is currently 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (covering Periods 4-7: 39, 55, 47, 83) to capture the recent volatility and the latest spike, resulting in an average of 56. With L=0, mu_hat will be set to (1+0)*56. I will use the same N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 7 (83 units) compared to the previous stabilization (avg ~54), indicating a potential seasonal surge as April begins.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 8, 2019. We are managing 'Nora T-shirt', a jersey basic item. Current on-hand inventory is 1 unit with no items in transit. Historical review: Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has been volatile: after an initial spike in Feb (P2: 120), it hovered around 50, then spiked again in late March (P7: 83) before returning to 55 in P8. Given that we are moving deeper into spring, demand for t-shirts is likely to remain elevated or show further spikes. The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P3-P8) is approximately 60 units (77+39+55+47+83+55 / 6 = 59.3). Using a recent_N of 6 captures the post-spike stabilization and the recent volatility. Setting L to default (0) as lead time is reliable. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the current spring demand regime and its associated variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. We are managing a women's jersey T-shirt. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has been volatile: after an early spike in February (Period 2), it stabilized around 55, then saw another minor spike in Period 7 (83) and a sharp drop in Period 9 (28). The current on-hand inventory is 32 units. Given the transition into late spring, demand may fluctuate but doesn't show a sustained upward trend over the last two weeks (55 then 28). I will use recent_N for both mean and sigma to capture this recent cooling while maintaining a buffer for seasonal variability. Specifically, I'll use N=3 to capture the most recent regime (P7-P9), where the average is (83+55+28)/3 \u2248 55.3. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 9 demand dropped to 28 units from a 2-period average of 69 (+/- 14 units), indicating no sustained seasonal growth in mid-April yet.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/22. The product is a Nora T-shirt (Jersey Basic), which typically sees stable to increasing demand as spring progresses. Recent demand history shows significant volatility: P7 (83), P8 (55), P9 (28), and P10 (43), resulting in an average of 52.25 units over the last 4 periods. The carry-over insights previously flagged a surge and subsequent drop, suggesting there is no clear sustained upward trend yet. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting actual lead time (observed lead_time=0 in all 10 periods). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5. The OR engine will target the median demand. To capture the recent volatility without overreacting to the P9 dip, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations, reflecting the post-March 25th behavior. With L=0, the engine calculates base_stock = (1+0)*mu + z*(sqrt(1+0)*sigma).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598001' (Nora T-shirt) is a jersey basic with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. The current date is April 29, 2019, transitioning into May. Historically, lead times have been consistent at 0 periods. Demand has stabilized after the initial February/March spikes. Over the last four periods (P8-P11), demand has been 55, 28, 43, and 41, averaging 41.75 units. Period 9 was an outlier on the low side. Given the product category (Everyday Basics) and the approaching summer season, I anticipate demand will remain steady or slightly increase but won't likely experience major spikes yet. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this recent stabilization around ~42 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the reduction in volatility compared to earlier months.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a stable regime following the April 1 volatility; average demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is approximately 42 units with lower variance.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product (Nora T-shirt) is a 'jersey basic' feminine staple. Historically, demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) with values of 55, 28, 43, 41, and 41, averaging 41.6 units per week. This indicates a very stable demand regime compared to the early spring volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for all 12 periods. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). I am setting L to 0 (promised), and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the stability seen from early April through late April, while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the upcoming week based on this most recent regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Analyzing the demand history, the product ('Nora T-shirt') has stabilized significantly following earlier volatility in March and early April. Over the last five periods (P9-P13), demand values have been 28, 43, 41, 41, and 31, resulting in an average of 36.8 units per period. This regime is lower and more stable than the spring transition period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level. Given the high stability and lower mean observed recently, I am setting N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent stable regime while ignoring the older high-volatility spikes. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it is robustly 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in May: Average demand from P9-P13 is 36.8 units, showing lower variance compared to the March-April transition period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 saw a significant demand spike to 67 units after several weeks of lower, stable demand (avg ~37 in the preceding 5 periods). As we are now in late May (2019/5/20) and the product is a 'Nora T-shirt' (Everday Basics Jersey), this likely indicates the start of a sustained summer demand period. We stocked out in Period 14 (on-hand dropped to 0, satisfied 37 out of 67), so we need to aggressively adjust the order base stock to capture this higher demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent shift, I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to weight the recent jump more heavily (avg of last 3 is (31+41+67)/3 = 46.3, vs. 67 last period), and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility from the stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 14 (2019/5/13): Demand jumped to 67 units from a stable 5-period average of ~37 units, signaling the likely onset of peak summer demand for the T-shirt category.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/27, and the SKU 'Nora T-shirt' is entering its peak summer season. Historical data shows a clear regime shift: demand in Period 14 was 67 and Period 15 was 87, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~37. This follows the carry-over insight that summer demand is surging. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit because all units were sold out in Period 15. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid further stockouts during this high-demand summer phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 2 periods (P14-P15) to capture this new regime. Setting L to default (0). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the OR backend targets a 50% service level, but the 'cap' mechanism and our increased sigma_hat will help provide a safety buffer for the increasing trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 confirmed: Summer peak initiated with demand increasing from ~37 to an average of 77 units (+108%) over the last two periods (P14-P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), we are in the early summer season for the 'Nora T-shirt'. Previous insights confirmed a demand jump starting Period 14 (May 13), with demand values of 67, 87, and most recently 51 in Period 16. The average demand across this 3-period 'summer regime' is 68.3 units. The drop to 51 in Period 16 suggests that while demand is higher than the spring average (~37), it is volatile. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this new summer baseline (average 68.3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using a short N filters out the lower spring demand data that would otherwise pull the forecast too low. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period reaction to demand shifts. Setting parameters to cover this higher mean and standard deviation ensures we maximize profit while the $1/$1 profit-to-holding ratio targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P14-P16) exhibits a higher mean of 68.3 units compared to the previous spring stabilization of ~37 units, although variance remains high.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/06/10, entering the peak summer season for 'Nora T-shirt', which is a jersey basic. Historically, a regime shift was identified at Period 14 (mid-May), with demand jumping from ~37 to a higher mean. However, the last two periods (P16-P17) saw a decline from the initial surge (51 and 35 units respectively). The average demand for the 'summer regime' (P14-P17) is 60.0 units, but with very high volatility (std dev ~22). Lead time remains consistently 0. I will prioritize the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the summer regime shift while acknowledging the recent dip in demand. This targets a mu_hat based on the summer average of 60.0 units, and uses a calculated sigma to manage the significant variance observed in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient stock level despite the high demand swings (Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, meaning we target a 50th percentile base stock before the capacity cap).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt', which is highly seasonal for the summer. After a brief spike in demand in late May (P14-P15: 67 and 87 units), demand has cooled off in the last three weeks (P16-P18: 51, 35, and 43 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 56.6 units. Given we are now in mid-June, demand is expected to remain in this 'summer regime' but has stabilized at a lower mean than the initial peak spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the summer demand profile (P14-P18) while accounting for the recent decrease in mean compared to the initial surge. With equal profit and holding costs ($1), the OR engine will target a 50% service level, which is appropriate for a stable basic item. On-hand is currently 17 units with 0 in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (starting P14) has moderated after the initial May spike; the average demand for the period 2019/5/13 to 2019/6/10 (P14-P18) is 56.6 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598001 (Nora T-shirt) is in a summer demand regime that started around P14 (May 13). Demand remains highly volatile, with P19 seeing a significant spike to 92 units, the highest since February. The previous five-period average (P14-P18) was ~56.6, but the most recent observation suggests a potential secondary summer peak as we enter late June (Period 20). Starting inventory is 0, and there are no units in transit. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning we align base stock precisely with the mean demand to minimize the sum of lost sales and holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the recent volatility and the late June spike while maintaining stability, I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P14-P19) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encapsulates the entire summer regime shift recorded in the carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand volatility increased significantly in late June: Period 19 demand reached 92 units, a 63% increase over the P14-P18 average of 56.6 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt has surged significantly as we enter July, with Period 20 reaching an all-time high of 131 units. This aligns with the 'Summer demand' regime identified in carry-over insights but indicates a new, much higher intensification. The previous 5nd-period average (P15-P19) was approx 61.6, but the massive spike to 131 in P20 (a 112% increase over that average) suggests we are hitting the peak of the summer season. Given the Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend objective is a 50% service level (q=0.5), but to avoid the consecutive stockouts seen in P19 and P20, I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly. I'm choosing recent_N with N=7 to capture the summer trend (P14-P20) while giving heavy weight to the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak reached a new high in late June: Period 20 demand spiked to 131 units, confirming a high-volume, high-variance regime for the T-shirt category during July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season (July) for the Nora T-shirt, a soft jersey basic. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Demand has jumped dramatically over the last three weeks: P19=92, P20=131, and P21=142. This matches the 'Summer demand peak' insight from Period 21. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, but the order is capped by a 95th percentile safety stock limit. To protect against stockouts during this high-volume period, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent regime shift (average demand ~121.7 units). This approach ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current sharp upward trend rather than pulling from lower springtime averages.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak intensified in July: Demand for the last 3 periods (P19-P21) averaged 121.7 units, reflecting a 115% increase over the early summer average (~56.6).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season (July) for the 'Nora T-shirt', which is a 'Womens Everyday Basic'. Historical demand over the last four periods (P19-P22) has significantly surged to 92, 131, 142, and 133 units respectively, confirming a high-volume summer regime. The average demand during this four-period peak is 124.5 units per week with high volatility. Current inventory is zero, following several periods of stockouts where demand exceeded arrival. To capture this sustained peak while accounting for the high variance observed in recent weeks, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4). This matches the detected regime shift starting in mid-June. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak fully established: Average demand for Period 19 to 22 (2019/6/17 to 2019/7/08) is 124.5 units, representing a sustained high-volume regime approximately 120% higher than the early summer average.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt remains in a high-volume summer peak regime. Between Period 19 and Period 23 (mid-June to mid-July), demand has consistently ranged from 92 to 142 units, with an average of approximately 127.8 units over the last 5 periods. The most recent demand (P23) was 141. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to demand consistently exceeding order caps. The promised lead time is 0 and historical observations confirm actual lead time remains 0. To capture this sustained peak while accounting for high variance, I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the contemporary summer demand level (~128 units). Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility observed during this peak season, ensuring the base stock level is sufficiently high to minimize stockouts while the OR backend provides the necessary capping.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained through mid-July: Average demand for P19-P23 (2019/6/17 to 2019/7/15) is 127.8 units, confirming a 125% increase over early summer levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', currently in late July (2019/7/29). We are in the peak summer demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand averages 130.8 units (92, 131, 142, 133, 141, 146), showing a sustained high-volume plateau. The last three periods specifically show very high stability at 143 units. Although on-hand inventory is currently 0, the backend OR logic uses base-stock calculations to determine the order size. Given lead_time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to reflect this current peak level. I'll use recent_N with N=6 to capture the full breadth of this summer surge (which began around P19), ensuring the OR engine has enough signal to meet the 140+ unit demand seen recently while balancing against overstocking as we approach August.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand plateau confirmed: Period 21-24 demand is stable at an average of 140.5 units, representing the peak of the seasonal cycle for T-shirts.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-05. The product is a women's T-shirt, which is currently in its peak summer demand regime. Historical demand for the last five periods (P21-P25) has been consistently high and increasing (142, 133, 141, 146, 157), with an average of 143.8 units. The stock has been consistently selling out because the OR engine's orders (capped by historical mean/variance) are not keeping pace with the seasonal surge. To capture this peak and avoid lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to focus exclusively on this high-volume plateau. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so I will use the 'calculate' method to maintain this empirical evidence. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current volatility of this summer peak. This should allow the base stock calculation to cover the current high demand levels before the late-summer/autumn downturn begins.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified in late July: Demand for P21-P25 (2019/07/01 to 2019/07/29) averaged 143.8 units, marking the highest sustained regime of the year.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/12. We are in the peak summer demand phase for the Nora T-shirt, a jersey basic. Historically, the demand regime significantly shifted around late June (Period 19), with the last 5 periods (P22-P26) showing a high, sustained average demand of approximately 142.6 units (133, 141, 146, 157, 136). Although Period 26 demand (136) was slightly lower than Period 25 (157), it remains well within the peak summer range. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. I will use the last 6 periods (P21-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entirety of the established peak plateau of ~142 units. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current high-demand environment while accounting for recent variance.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/19, signifying the late-summer period for the 'Nora T-shirt'. Historically, demand peaked in July and exhibits a slight decelerating trend as we enter mid-to-late August (P26: 136, P27: 118). Despite this minor decline, the demand remains substantially higher than the spring baseline. The observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. To manage the gradual transition out of the peak summer regime while maintaining high service levels (since profit equals holding cost), I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the sustained high demand from late July to mid-August (average ~140) while allowing the OR backend to adjust to the most recent downward movement. I'm setting L to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the stable 0-period lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak established in July/early August has begun to show signs of a seasonal cooling: Period 27 demand (118) is the lowest since late June, down from the P21-P26 average of ~143.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/26. We are exiting the peak summer season for the Nora T-shirt. Historical data shows demand peaked in July and early August (averaging ~143 units), but has become highly volatile as we enter late August. Period 28 saw a surprise spike to 163 units, but Period 27 was lower (118). Given the 'Women's Everyday Basics' category and the end-of-August date, we expect a seasonal cooling to begin shortly, although the most recent 5-period average (P24-P28) remains high at 144 units. Because lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to lock in this performance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this high late-summer volume while allowing for the base-stock calculation to react to the high current variance. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N with N=5 to account for the increased volatility (118 vs 163) observed in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in late August (Period 28 demand: 163), contradicting the initial cooling signal from Period 27 (118). The summer peak is extending longer than expected but with high variance.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598001 (Women's T-shirt) is exhibiting a prolonged and volatile summer peak as we enter September. Period 29 demand reached 180 units, the highest in the history of the game, indicating that the 'seasonal cooling' signaled in Period 27 was premature. Instead, demand is surging in late August/early September. Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), the average demand is 150.4 units with high variance. Given 'lead time = 0', we need to cover the current period's highly volatile demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for the mean to capture this late-summer surge and will maintain a conservative L=0. Because profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock will primarily track the mean unless sigma_hat is adjusted; however, to prevent stockouts in this high-demand phase while balancing the risk of a sudden seasonal drop, I will rely on the capping mechanism and the 5-period average.

Carry-over insight: Late summer surge confirmed at Period 29: Demand peaked at 180 units (2019/08/26), significantly above the previous July plateau of ~140, indicating an extended high-volume season with increased volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598001 (Women's T-shirt) is entering early September (2019/09/09). Historical demand shows a late summer peak in August (Period 28: 163, Period 29: 180). However, Period 30 data (114 units) indicates a significant cooling trend as the season transitions from summer to autumn. This drop of ~36% from the peak suggests the summer 'extended high-volume season' mentioned in Carry-over Insights is subsiding. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining demand phase, I am shifting from the high-volume August regime to a recent-period calculation (N=3) that captures the current downward trajectory (P28-P30 average: 152; however, P30 alone is 114). I will use N=4 to include the start of the decline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent '0 periods' reported in all concluded messages (P1-P30).

Carry-over insight: Demand transition observed at Period 30: Summer peak (avg ~140-180) is declining as of Sep 2, with demand dropping to 114 units (-36% from P29 peak).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Nora T-shirt' (a jersey basic) is entering a seasonal transition as of mid-September (Period 31-32). Historical data shows the summer peak (avg ~140-180 units) has definitively broken: Period 30 demand was 114, and Period 31 demand was 87. This follows a clear downward trend from the late August peak of 180. To avoid excessive holding costs during this cooling phase, I am reducing mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period average (P29-P31), which captures this downward trajectory (180, 114, 87; avg ~127). Although the current on-hand inventory is 57, the 'recent_N' method will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the observed decline while maintaining a buffer for the remaining volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling confirmed: Demand dropped from a late-August peak of 180 to 87 units by Sep 9 (Period 31), a 51% reduction, signaling the end of the high-summer regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt (Everyday Basics) is clearly exiting its high-summer peak. Following the late-August surge (P29 demand: 180), demand has dropped and stabilized at a lower level: 114 (P30), 87 (P31), and 103 (P32). The average of these last three periods is 101.3 units, compared to the previous peak average of ~140-180. September usually marks a transition to fall/winter layering where basic T-shirts continue to sell but at a more moderate volume than the summer peak. I will use a N=3 period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this cooling trend and lower the base stock, preventing excess inventory as we move into autumn. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The 'Nora T-shirt' is exiting its peak summer season (July-August) and transitioning into a lower-demand autumn regime. Recent demand reflects this cooling: P30 (114), P31 (87), P32 (103), and P33 (112). While there was a slight rebound in the last two periods compared to the post-summer low of 87, the average across the last 4 periods (P30-P33) is 104 units, significantly lower than the late-August peak of 180. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since the ending inventory on P33 was 0 (stockout), I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-demand regime but maintain a safety buffer using recent standard deviation to capture the transition's volatility. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the most recent post-peak trend.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling further confirmed: Demand for the month of September (P30-P33) has averaged 104 units, a 35% decrease from the late-August high-volume regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a post-summer cooling phase for the T-shirt category. Demand peaked in late August (180 units) and has since fallen to a more stable regime. The average demand for the month of September (P30-P34) is 99.8 units (114, 87, 103, 112, 83), which is a significant drop from the peak summer levels of ~140-150. Given the 'Everyday Basics' nature of the product, we expect demand to continue stabilizing or slightly declining as autumn progresses. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking in a cooling market while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=5, covering the entire September cooling period. This balances the recent high-volume summer data with the current downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer stabilization confirmed: September demand (P30-P34) averaged 99.8 units, down from the peak summer average of ~144 units (-31%), establishing a new baseline for the autumn season.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt is in a post-summer stabilization phase. After peak summer highs (avg ~144) and late August volatility (reaching 180), demand for September (P30-P34) settled to an average of 99.8 units. The most recent demand in P35 (64 units) continues a downward cooling trend as we move further into October. I am using a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (P30-P35) to capture this post-peak regime while acknowledging the recent dip. This covers the period from 2019/09/02 to 2019/10/07. Observed lead time consistently remains 0. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that balances the $1 profit/unit against $1 holding/unit/period, essentially aiming for a 50% service level which is appropriate given equal costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer cooling further intensified in October: Demand for P35 (64 units) is the lowest since early June, confirming a shift away from the ~100 unit September baseline towards a lower autumn regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt is in a clear seasonal decline as we move further into October. After the peak summer regime (avg ~144) and a September stabilization (avg ~100), the most recent two periods (P35-P36) show a lower average of 72 units. While P36 demand (80) was higher than P35 (64), both are significantly below the September baseline, confirming a cooling trend but with some weekly variance. Actual lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture this immediate downward shift to ~72 units per period. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to provide a buffer for the observed late-season volatility while still reflecting the overall reduction in volume.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand decline confirmed: Average demand for the first half of October (P35-P36) has dropped to 72 units, representing a 28% decrease from the September baseline (~100 units).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in an autumn demand regime for the Nora T-shirt. Demand in October (P35-P37) has been 64, 80, and 88 units respectively, showing a slight upward trend within the broader post-summer cooling pattern, averaging 77.3 units. This is higher than the early October estimate but significantly lower than the July/August peak (~144 units). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Inventory is currently at 0 due to demand exceeding supply in the last period. To ensure adequate stock while acknowledging the transition to lower late-year demand, I am using a recent_N (N=4) approach to capture the stabilization after the major September drop, which results in a mean demand forecast of approximately 78.75 units per period. This balances the risk of stockouts observed in P37 with the cooling seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand stabilization confirmed: Following the September drop, demand for P34-P37 (Oct forward) has averaged 78.8 units, establishing a mid-range baseline between the summer peak (~144) and the spring low (~37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historically, demand peaked in July/August and has been cooling through the autumn. Recent demand (P34-P38) has been: 83, 64, 80, 88, 49. The average of these 5 periods is 72.8 units. The drop to 49 units in P38 suggests a potential move toward a lower winter/late-autumn regime. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the OR engine seeks a 50% service level (the median). I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent autumn stabilization/decline, which provides a more accurate forecast than including the volatile summer peak. On-hand inventory is 30 units, with zero in-transit, leaving a gap against the projected demand that the OR engine will fill.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand baseline potentially shifting lower in November: Period 38 demand (49 units) is significantly below the P34-P37 average of 78.8 units (-38%), suggesting a transition to a winter regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a transition from autumn to winter for the 'Nora T-shirt', which is a jersey basic. Historically, demand for this item is highly seasonal, peaking in late summer (reaching an average of ~144 units) and declining through autumn. Recent demand data shows a stabilization in October at around 72-80 units, but a notable dip occurred in P38 (49 units) and P39 (61 units), bringing the most recent 2-week average to 55 units. Given that we are moving deeper into November, a lower demand regime (winter baseline) is expected. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-volume regime by using the last 6 periods (P34-P39), which captures the step-down from the 100-unit September average. Sigma_hat is also updated using the last 6 periods to account for the reduced but still present volatility during this seasonal transition. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand transition confirmed: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P34-P39) has dropped to 70.8 units, compared to the September baseline of ~100 units, indicating a move towards the winter low.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' is entering its winter cooling phase. Period 40 demand dropped to 28 units, matching the previous low in Period 9 and continuing the downward trend observed since September. Across the last 3 periods (P38-P40, late Oct-mid Nov), demand has averaged 46 units (49, 61, 28), which is significantly lower than the September baseline (~100) and the early October baseline (~79). I am moving to a recent_N strategy with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition to lower volumes and relatively higher variance (CV). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand decline confirmed: Average demand for the late autumn/early winter transition (P38-P40) has stabilized at approximately 46 units, reflecting a 42% decrease from the October average (~79 units).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, moving deep into the winter season for the 'Nora T-shirt' (jersey basic). History shows a clear seasonal lifecycle: spring peak (~120), summer plateau (~140), late summer spike (180), and an autumn decline starting in September. We are now in a winter low regime. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is 46.25 units (49, 61, 28, 47). Period 41 ended with 0 on-hand inventory because the order placed (3 units) plus existing inventory (43) was insufficient to meet the demand of 47. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the current winter stabilization while allowing for slight late-November/early-December volatility, I will use a recent_N lookback of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (approx 46 units/week).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019 (Period 43). Based on historical data, demand for this basic t-shirt SKU has transitioned into a lower-volume winter regime. Following the autumn decline from ~100 units to ~79 units, the recent demand for the last five periods (P38-P42) has been 49, 61, 28, 47, and 64, averaging 49.8 units. The last two weeks (47 and 64 units) show a slight uptick compared to the mid-November low of 28, possibly indicating minor holiday interest or general variance within the winter baseline. The lead time has consistently remained at 1 period (observed arrival logic: order placed in N arrives in N with 0-period lead time), so I will use L=0. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current winter regime (avg ~50), and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the moderate variance seen in this period range.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime stabilized at Period 41: Average demand for the period 2019/10/28 to 2019/11/25 (P38-P42) is 49.8 units, representing a 37% decrease from the October average (~79).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are in a stable winter demand regime for basic T-shirts. Period 43 demand dropped significantly to 17 units, though the previous 5-period average (P38-P42) was approximately 50 units. While the Period 43 drop might signal a final year-end dip, the overall late-autumn/winter average remains near 45-50 units. On-hand inventory is 33 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N to capture the winter baseline (P38-P43, N=6) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the current seasonal state better than the high-volume summer data. This ensures we don't over-order during the seasonal low while maintaining enough stock for the observed baseline.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P38-P43) average demand is 44.5 units, confirming a sustained seasonal low for the basic T-shirt category.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). The product, a basic jersey T-shirt, is in a winter demand regime. Historical demand for the last seven periods (P38-P44) has been 49, 61, 28, 47, 64, 17, 17, yielding an average of approximately 40.4 units. Specifically, the last two periods (P43-P44) showed a significant drop to 17 units, suggesting a further seasonal cooling as the year ends. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this winter stabilization (~40 units), which provides a safer buffer than only looking at the very recent local lows. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the holding cost equals profit (1:1), the OR backend will target a 50% service level; setting sigma_hat with recent_N=7 will account for the moderate volatility observed during this winter transition.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the peak holiday season (Christmas week). For a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, we are currently in a established winter low demand regime, as noted in the Carry-over Insights (avg ~44.5 units for P38-P43). However, the most recent three periods (P43-P45) have shown even lower demand, averaging 18.3 units. While typically there might be a small holiday lift, the data suggests this specific basic SKU is trending lower, likely due to cold weather seasonality reducing demand for short-sleeved jerseys. Lead time is consistently 0 (same-period arrival). I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent drop in demand toward 18-20 units, while keeping sigma_hat at recent_N=6 to provide a buffer for any potential post-holiday clearance or gift-card spending volatility. This approach balances the current low-demand trend with the risk of stockouts if a slight year-end bump occurs.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime intensified in December: Average demand for P43-P45 (2019/12/02 to 2019/12/16) dropped to 18.3 units, a 59% decrease from the late November average (~44.5), reflecting deep winter seasonality for short-sleeve basics.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, which is the final period of the simulation. Historical demand for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt has confirmed a significant seasonal low during December, with the last four periods (P43-P46) averaging only 17.5 units, compared to the November average of ~44.5 units and the summer peak of ~144 units. The 'promised lead time' of 0 periods has remained consistent and reliable throughout the history. Since we are in the final period (Period 47) and currently hold 5 units on-hand, I will set the OR parameters to reflect this deep winter regime. I'm using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent December volume (avg 17.5) and lower volatility, ensuring the base stock level targets this current low-demand environment.
