Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for high-waisted skinny denim trousers. There is no prior 'conclude' message. Historical demand (last 5 weeks) shows: 20, 36, 191, 160, 99. The significant spike starting 2019-01-21 (from ~28 to ~150) suggests a regime shift or seasonal trend for Feb/Spring items. Total historical mean is 101.2, but the last 3 samples average 150. Based on the product type (skinny denim), seasonal demand often rises in early spring. The promised lead time is 0. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent higher demand volume (191, 160, 99) and L=default (0) to allow for immediate stocking, as we have 0 on-hand inventory.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny high-waisted denim trouser. Looking at historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), we saw a significant ramp-up: 20 -> 36 -> 191 -> 160 -> 99. In Period 1 (Feb 11), the demand was 184, which aligns with the high-demand regime observed in mid-to-late January. The inventory on-hand is 43, with 0 currently in-transit because the Period 1 order (227 units) arrived immediately (lead_time = 0). Since the promised lead time is 0 and the actual lead time for the first period was 0, I will stay with lead time 0. For demand forecasting, the average of the last 4 periods (Jan 21, Jan 28, Feb 4, Feb 11) is (191+160+99+184)/4 = 158.5. This represents the current high-demand regime better than the long-term average including the initial low weeks. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is February 25, 2019. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser (Divided collection), which typically experiences high demand during the transition from winter to spring. Demand for the last five historical weeks averaged 101.2 units (20, 36, 191, 160, 99). However, recent actual performance in Periods 1 and 2 shows demand significantly higher at 184 and 216 units respectively, indicating a shift or a seasonal peak relevant to the current dates. The average of the last 2 actual demand periods is 200 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time is indeed 0 (P1 and P2 orders arrived immediately). Moving into March, I expect this higher demand regime to persist or slightly increase as spring shopping begins. I will use recent_N=2 for mu_hat to capture this recent 200-unit demand level and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen since the jump in late January (P1, P2, and the 191/160/99 samples). L will remain at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting late January/early February: volume increased from double digits to an average of ~190-210 units per week. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/3/4. Historical data and game history show a clear demand regime shift that began in late January. Initial samples from early January were low (20-36), but starting from 2019-01-21, demand surged. The demands for the last four recorded weeks are 191, 160, 99 (from initial samples) followed by 184, 216, and 149 (from game history). This averages to approximately 166 units over the last 6 periods. The most recent three periods (game history) average 183 units. There is some volatility (sigma), with demand varying between 149 and 216 recently. Lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a recent N of 3 to capture the most current demand mean and variance, as the regime seems to have stabilized at this higher level compared to the start of the year.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' belongs to the Divided collection, which typically sees consistent demand. Looking at historical samples and game history, a clear regime shift occurred in late January/early February. Pre-conclude samples were low (20, 36), but the last four concluded periods show significantly higher demand: 184, 216, 149, 159 (average: 177 units). The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~190-210, but more recent periods (P3, P4) suggest it may be stabilizing slightly lower around 175-180. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on all previous cycles. Since L=0, we need mu_hat to cover (1+L)=1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the pre-February low-volume data. This helps the OR engine maintain a base stock that covers the ~177 unit average demand plus a safety stock for the observed volatility (Std Dev ~30).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Reviewing the history, the 'high volume' regime identified in Period 3 has stabilized. The demand for the last three periods (P3-P5) was 149, 159, and 151, which is remarkably consistent, averaging ~153 units. Prior to this, P1 and P2 were slightly higher (184, 216). This suggests a slight cooling from the initial peak but still significantly higher than the January samples. Lead time is definitively confirmed as 0 periods (all orders arrived same-period). Given the stability over the last 3 periods, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this balanced demand level (approx 153/week). Since the profit is $19 and holding cost is $1, the target service level q is approximately 0.95, meaning the OR backend will maintain a healthy buffer. On-hand is currently 76, which is about half a week of current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower but steady range (~150-160) for 3 consecutive periods following the initial February peak.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (Skinny Denim Trousers) has maintained a stable demand regime for the past four periods (P3-P6) with demand values of 149, 159, 151, and 159. This averages to approximately 154.5 units per week, significantly lower than the P2 peak of 216. Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), and lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs, I am targeting a base stock level that reflects this 'new normal' stability. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime without being influenced by the initial February spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand stability confirmed over 4 periods (P3-P6) at an average of 155 units/week; volatility has also decreased significantly compared to the initial launch phase.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has shown highly stable demand and lead-time performance. For the last five periods (P3-P7), demand has settled into a tight range: 149, 159, 151, 159, and 153. The mean demand for this stable period (N=5) is exactly 154.2 with a low standard deviation (~4.5). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals in the same period as ordered. Since we are entering April, typically a stable season for core denim items before spring/summer shifts, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this high-stability regime. L is set to 'calculate' as it consistently shows 0. On-hand inventory is very low (11), so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order to meet the base stock derived from this mean.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. In Period 8 (April 1), demand surged to 205 units, significantly exceeding the stable average of ~155 observed from Period 3-7. This spike resulted in 43 units of lost sales and an ending on-hand inventory of 0. April typically sees increased demand for spring fashion like 'Garment Lower body / Trousers'. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and account for the apparent upward shift/seasonal volatility, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use the last 6 periods (Period 3-8) to capture the higher volume regime (average ~162.7) but will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 185 to buffer against the recent 205-unit spike and compensate for the 0 units on-hand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the increased variance introduced by the recent 205-unit demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in early April (Period 8); demand spiked to 205 (+30% vs previous average), causing a stockout. Period 3-8 average is 163 units/week.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is mid-April. This SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is a core 'Divided Collection' staple. Historical demand shows a stable regime from Period 3-7 averaging ~155, followed by a spike to 205 (Period 8) and a slight normalization to 165 (Period 9). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The stockout in Period 8 occurred because base stock levels were calibrated for the lower average (155). The Period 9 order successfully replenished stock. For Period 10, demand is likely to reside in the 160-180 range as April spring fashion demand remains active. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the post-spike levels (avg ~176) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent uptick in volatility (std ~25). Setting L to 0 based on consistent historical performance.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. Historical demand shows a seasonal peak in February/March (launch/spring transition), which has stabilized and recently exhibited a declining trend in mid-April (Period 10 demand was 121 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The recent volatility (a spike in P8 followed by a drop in P10) suggests that the previous 163-unit mean is no longer accurate. I am selecting N=4 for the demand mean to capture the recent volatility and the downward trend (P7-P10: 153, 205, 165, 121; Average = 161). For sigma, I will use a larger window (N=8) to include the April spike in the variance calculation, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer despite the lower recent mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in April: recent demand ranged from a high of 205 (P8) to a low of 121 (P10), indicating a potential seasonal deceleration following the spring launch phase.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a staple denim item. Observed demand over the last three periods (P9-P11) shows a distinct downward trend (165, 121, 119), averaging 135 units/week compared to the preceding average of 163. This aligns with the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 11 suggesting a seasonal deceleration following the spring launch. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs (on-hand is currently 81) as demand cools, I am shifting the mu_hat focus to the most recent 4 periods (P8-P11) which captures the high outlier (205) and the recent lows (121, 119), resulting in a more balanced but responsive mean of ~152 units. I will use a recent window (N=5) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in April while acknowledging the lower absolute demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand deceleration confirmed: Periods 10-11 show demand stabilizing at ~120 units, a 25% decrease from the P3-P9 average of 163.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Historical demand shows a stabilization phase after a peak in early April (P8: 205). The last three periods (P10-P12) have seen demand of 121, 119, and 150, averaging 130 units per week. This represents a deceleration compared to the mid-regime average of ~160. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To manage the current on-hand inventory of 61 units and meet expected demand while minimizing holding costs, I will use a recent_N method for demand forecasting focusing on the last 3 periods (N=3) to weight the recent stabilization/deceleration more heavily. This targets a mu_hat of approximately 130 and adapts to the reduced volatility (sigma_hat) observed in this lower-demand regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). Analyzing the history (P10-P13), demand has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the early spring peak. Recent demands are 121, 119, 150, and 138, averaging approximately 132 units/week over the last 4 periods. This is a significant decrease from the early spring average of ~160+. Leads times are consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (21 units), and there is no inventory in transit. Therefore, I need to place an order that covers the upcoming demand (next 1 period) at the new stabilized lower volume. Using N=4 for mu_hat properly captures this recent deceleration while providing enough inventory to satisfy demand levels similar to the previous two weeks (150 and 138).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower regime in May (P10-P13) with an average of 132 units/week, down from the 163 units/week seen in March/April.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is in a stabilized lower demand regime following the spring peak. Over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), demand has averaged 132.8 units (121, 119, 150, 138, 136) with relatively low volatility compared to the initial launch phase. On-hand inventory is currently low (21 units) after demand exactly matched supply last period (P14). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently maintained in historical data. Therefore, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized May demand level. The OR engine will use these parameters to generate a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand (132.8 units) and maintains a safety buffer around 20-30 units based on the critical ratio (Profit $19 / Total $20 = 0.95), effectively targeting a stock level that replenishes the depleted on-hand inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. We ended Period 15 with 0 inventory due to a stockout (demand was 160, sold 154). We are in a regime that stabilized in May (P10-P15). The demand average over the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is 137 units/week. However, the most recent period (P15) saw a spike to 160, which follows a pattern of occasional volatility seen in early April. Given that the promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting actual lead time, I will use a conservative calculation for mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to reflect the stabilized May regime while acknowledging the recent uptick. Setting L to default (0). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the volatility within this current regime, specifically the range between 119 and 160.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains present in the lower regime: Period 15 saw a 17% increase (to 160) from the previous 5-period average (133), leading to a stockout. May average is now 137 units/week.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in Period 17 (early June). Historical demand analysis shows a high-volume phase in February (avg ~200), followed by a moderate stable phase in March/April (avg ~160), and a recent lower-volume phase starting in May (P10-P16 avg ~134). The most recent period (P16) saw demand dip to 115, following a spike to 160 in P15. Actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all history. Given the transition into early summer, demand for this 'superstretch denim' appears to be stabilizing in the 130-140 range but remains volatile. To account for this seasonality and the recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P10-P16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current lower-regime average (approx 134) and its associated volatility while ignoring the outdated higher-demand peaks from early spring. Setting L=0 explicitly as supported by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand dropped significantly to 86 units, following a trend of lower demand since Period 10. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 127 units/week, while the long-term average (P1-P17) is significantly higher. However, the most recent four periods (P14-P17) show even more volatility (136, 160, 115, 86). Given the SKU (High-waisted skinny denim) and the current date (June 10th), we are moving into the peak summer season where denim demand often softens compared to spring. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the last 5 periods) to capture this recent deceleration and volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increasing variance in this lower-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand deceleration observed entering June: Periods 16-17 show demand dropping to 115 and 86 respectively. The P13-P17 average is 127 units, compared to the P10-P13 average of 132 and the P3-P9 average of 163. Transitioning from spring peak to summer season is likely driving this downward trend.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are observing a transition from the spring peak to a lower summer demand regime for this skinny denim TRS SKU. Demand over the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 115, 86, and 121, averaging 107.3 units/week. This represents a significant decline from the May average (~137) and the March/April average (~163). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this downward trend while maintaining a high service level (profit/holding cost ratio suggests a ~95% target service level), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18) to capture the lower demand regime while accounting for the recent rebound from 86 to 121. The backend will calculate 1+L (1.0) times the mean of these last 5 samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for June: Average demand for P16-P18 is 107 units, a ~20% decrease from the May average of 137.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in a confirmed lower demand regime for June (summer season). In Period 19, demand dropped significantly to 78 units, continuing a decelerating trend observed in June (P16: 115, P17: 86, P18: 121, P19: 78). The average for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is 100 units. Given 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a apparel item likely seeing lower summer interest compared to the spring launch peaks, I am setting mu_hat using a small window (N=4) to capture this most recent stabilization/dip. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same window to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: June demand regime (P16-P19) confirmed at approximately 100 units/week, down from the May average of 137 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. In the previous period (P20), demand was 110 units. Examining the recent June history (P17-P20), demand has been 86, 121, 78, and 110, averaging 98.75 units. This confirms the previously noted 'June regime' of approximately 100 units/week. Lead time consistently remains at 0. As we enter July, we should maintain parameters aligned with this lower summer stabilize regime. I will use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the stabilization after the June transition. Specifically, mu_hat will use the last 5 samples (P16-P20) which average (115+86+121+78+110)/5 = 102, and sigma_hat will be based on the same period to account for the intermittent volatility observed in this range.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 experienced a stockout in Period 21 due to a demand spike of 146 units, which is significantly higher than the average demand of ~100 units observed in June (P16-P20). This spike may be associated with early July shopping or summer sales. Given the stockout and the recent volatility, I will focus on the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture the shift from the stable June period to this higher early-July demand. The average demand for P16-P21 is approximately 109 units, but the last period (146) suggests a possible upward trend or increased variance that the OR engine needs to account for to avoid further stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent fluctuation. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased entering July: Period 21 saw a significant demand spike to 146 units, up 46% from the June average of 100 units, resulting in a stockout.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which experienced a significant demand spike in early July (P21 = 146 units), possibly due to the start of summer sales or a seasonal transition. In Period 22, demand returned to a more moderate level of 111 units. The July average so far (P21-P22) is approximately 128.5 units, which is higher than the June average (~100 units). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To account for this recent shift and protect against potential stockouts during a volatile July, I am basing the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) on the last 3 periods (P20-P22). This captures the recent uptick (110, 146, 111) while remaining responsive to the current seasonal context. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine a base stock that balances the high unit profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: July demand volatility confirmed: Periods 21-22 show an average of ~129 units, a 29% increase from the June average of 100 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in a volatile phase in mid-July. Following a significant demand spike in P21 (146 units), demand has returned to more moderate levels in P22 (111 units) and P23 (106 units). The average demand for the last 3 periods (P21-P23) is approximately 121 units/week, which is higher than the June average of ~100 but lower than the April peak. Given the historical volatility (spikes leading to stockouts in P8, P15, and P21), I will use a recent window of N=4 (covering P20-P23) to capture this new July average of ~118 units. This allows the backend to account for the recent shift upward from the June lows while recognizing the tapering observed in the last two weeks. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS (superstretch high-waisted denim), currently in late July (Period 25). Historically, lead time (L) has stayed consistent at 0 periods. The demand for June (P16-P19) was significantly lower (avg ~99), but July has shown high volatility. Early July (P21) saw a spike to 146, while the most recent period (P24) saw a dramatic drop to 58. Looking at the trend since the start of July (P21-P24), the average demand is 105.25. However, Given the transition into August, we should remain cautious of both sudden spikes (like P21) and the downward pressure seen in the late-month data. The backend profit and holding cost (ratio 19:1) target a 95% service level. Setting N=4 for mu_hat specifically targets the July regime to account for the current volatility, while sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to capture the variance from both the spike and the drop to ensure adequate shielding against stockouts if demand rebounds.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). July demand (Periods 21-25) showed significant volatility followed by a sharp drop: demand was 146, 111, 106, 58, and 63. This represents a clear downward trend likely tied to the end of the peak summer retail season for denim trousers. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 96.8 units, but the most recent two periods suggest a much lower regime (~60 units/week). To avoid overstocking during this apparent deceleration while maintaining a service level for potential late-summer rebounds, I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the localized mean while allowing the OR backend to handle the current volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected late July: Periods 24-25 show a sharp decrease to an average of 60.5 units/week, a ~40% drop from the July average (P21-23) of 121 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (late July to early August) shows a notable deceleration. While Periods 24-25 averaged ~60.5 units, Period 26 saw a partial recovery to 105 units. This suggests the deep drop was perhaps temporary or indicative of high volatility in a lower-demand summer phase. Given the product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim'\u2014a staple item\u2014demand is likely stabilizing between 60 and 100 units as we move through August. I will set N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (P24-P26 average = 75.3 units), providing a buffer for the recent 105-unit print while respecting the broader downward trend from July's average of 121. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility continues in the lower August regime: after a two-week low (avg 60.5), Period 26 returned to 105 units, suggesting a stabilized floor near 75-80 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (2019-08-19). Recent demand shows significant volatility in the 'low' regime: after stabilization around 60-70 units (P24-25), demand spiked to 105 (P26) and then 153 (P27), causing a stockout. This suggest a mid-August rally or early 'Back to School' interest for denim. The July-August average (P21-27) is roughly 106 units. I will set mu_hat to capture this recent volatility and the upward trend, using N=7 to encompass the July/August shifts. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-August rally detected: Demand increased from a late-July low of 60.5 to an average of 129 over the last two periods (P26-27), likely driven by back-to-school seasonality.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (2019/8/26), a period previously identified as a 'mid-August rally' likely due to back-to-school seasonality. Recent demand for Period 27-28 averaged 146 units (153 and 139), which aligns with the demand levels seen in early July and April. This is a significant jump from the late-July low of ~60 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, it is optimal to carry enough safety stock to avoid the stockouts experienced in Period 27. I will use a recent window (N=3, Periods 26-28) to capture this new elevated regime, which averages ~132 units/week, while maintaining exposure to the current upside volatility. Setting L to 0 (promised) as confirmed by the continuous history of same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school rally confirmed in late August: Demand for P27-P28 averaged 146 units, a 140% increase from the late-July low of 60.5 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently experiencing a back-to-school demand surge. For Period 29, demand reached 162 units, following a peak of 153 in Period 27 and 139 in Period 28. The 3-period average (P27-P29) is 151 units/week, representing a significant sustained increase from the late-July low of 60.5. With the current date at September 2nd, we are at the peak of the back-to-school season. On-hand inventory is critically low at 11 units. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this current high-demand regime (avg ~151) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility during this seasonal transition. This will ensure sufficient stock cover for the current period's demand while minimizing stockout risk given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school peak confirmed: Demand for P27-P29 averaged 151 units, a ~25% increase over the early August recovery phase (P26-P27 avg: 121) and a 150% increase from the late-July floor (P24-P25 avg: 60.5).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is currently in the midst of a significant demand surge. In Period 30 (2019/9/2), demand spiked to 282 units, which is a nearly 90% increase over the previous three-period average (~151). This spike indicates a transition from the back-to-school phase into a high-demand September peak, possibly influenced by new seasonal transitions or fashion promotions. The system experienced a stockout in Period 30, selling only 171 units. To avoid continued stockouts, mu_hat must be adjusted upwards significantly. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 250 units (approximating the recent peak but slightly smoothed to manage holding risk) and sigma_hat explicitly at 60 to account for high volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the history.

Carry-over insight: September demand surge confirmed: Period 30 demand spike to 282 units (+87% vs late-August average of 151), indicating a transition into a high-volume autumn regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (superstretch denim skinny jeans) has entered a definitive high-volume autumn regime. Period 30 saw demand spike to 282, and Period 31 confirmed this trend with 289 units, representing nearly a 100% increase over the late-August average. Historically, the lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To capture this significant structural shift while accounting for the high volatility common in these surge periods, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 (the two peak periods) and increasing sigma_hat to an 'explicit' value of 60. This reflects the standard deviation observed during high-demand spikes in the history of this SKU, ensuring the OR backend maintains a high service level for the fall season and mitigates the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 21, 27, and 30.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volume regime confirmed: Period 30-31 average demand is 285.5 units, a ~100% increase over the late-August back-to-school average of 146.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4935.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained autumn high-volume regime. Demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 282, 289, and 266, confirming a significantly higher plateau compared to the August rally. The average for this regime is 279 units/week. While Period 32 demand (266) was slightly lower than Period 31 (289), it remains well within the expected range for this new phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'concluded' messages. To maintain a high service level during this peak season, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this 279-unit average and using recent volatility (N=3) for sigma_hat to account for the heightened autumn demand variance. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated 270-280 units while accounting for potential stockout risks seen in P30.

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volume regime (P30-P32) confirmed with an average demand of 279 units/week, doubling the late-August average.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has entered a massive peak demand regime in late September. Period 33 observed a record demand of 455 units, a 60% increase from the previous autumn average (P30-P32 avg: 279), resulting in a significant stockout. The date (Sept 23-30) suggests a transition into prime autumn fashion season. Given the L=0 lead time, the inventory must be replenished immediately to cover this new level of demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the autumn regime (P30-P33), which averages 323 units. However, because the demand is clearly accelerating (from ~280s to 455), I will use an explicit mu_hat of 450 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this target level and avoids further stockouts during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak acceleration: Period 33 demand reached 455 units, a 60% increase over the early September average of 279 units, signaling a peak seasonal regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-volume autumn regime. Period 33 saw a massive demand spike to 455 units, whereas Period 34 dropped to 246 units. The product (Jeans) is highly seasonal. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) is 307.6 units. Given the extreme volatility in this peak season (ranging from 246 to 455), using a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat provides a balanced forecast that respects the higher autumn volume while smoothing the outlier peak from P33. L remains 0. Sigma is set to default to capture the high volatility seen in the autumn peak. Starting on-hand is 350, which is slightly above the 5-period average, so the OR backend will order appropriately to maintain the base stock for the current volatility level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn regime volatility confirmed: Period 30-34 average demand is 307.6 units, but weekly volume fluctuates significantly between ~250 and ~450 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volume autumn regime (starting Period 30) with significant volatility. Demand for the last 6 periods (P30-P35) has been: 282, 289, 266, 455, 246, 246. The average demand for this period is 297.3 units, with a peak of 455. The recent stability at 246 for two periods follows a massive spike, suggesting high variance remains a risk. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To manage the current volatility while accounting for the high autumn baseline, I will use a restricted 6-period window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the most recent seasonal trend (Autumn) and ensures the base stock reflects the current mean (~297) and high standard deviation observed during this peak season, protecting against further spikes (like the P33 455 unit event).

Carry-over insight: Autumn high-volume regime (P30-P35) average demand is 297 units/week, with high volatility (range 246-455).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 is in the middle of a high-volume autumn regime, though recent demand suggests a deceleration from the late September peak of 455 units. Period 36 demand dropped to 158 units, which is the lowest in the autumn series (P30-P36). This could indicate the passing of the initial seasonal surge. Averaging the last 7 periods (P30-P36) gives a mean of 277 units. However, given the sharp drop in P36 (158 units) and the high 270 unit on-hand inventory, I will adjust mu_hat using a shorter window (recent_N=4) to capture the cooling trend while maintaining enough stock to cover potential volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. These parameters aim to lower the base stock level to avoid high holding costs as demand potentially softens towards the end of October.

Carry-over insight: Autumn regime deceleration: Demand in Period 36 (158 units) is significantly below the P30-P35 average of 297 units, suggesting the seasonal peak has passed.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a deceleration phase following the autumn peak. Period 36 and 37 demand (158 and 182 units respectively) are notably lower than the early autumn average of ~300. This suggests we've moved from the 'Autumn High-Volume' regime to a late-autumn stabilization phase as we approach November. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining a service level for the current regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 (capturing Periods 35-37) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand behavior of the last three weeks (averaging 195 units), which better represents the current trend than the historical peak data.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn deceleration confirmed: Periods 36-37 demand average is 170 units, a 43% decrease from the P30-P35 autumn peak average of 297 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3289.00

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November (Period 39), following a confirmed late-autumn deceleration. Demand over the last three periods (P36-P38) has stabilized at an average of 172.7 units (158, 182, 178), which is a significant drop from the September-October autumn peak average of 297 units. The Lead Time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently adequate (93 on-hand), but we must maintain a base stock that covers the current demand regime (approximately 170-175 units per week). I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization while ignoring the high-volatility peak that occurred in early October. This prevents over-ordering during the seasonal wind-down while protecting against minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P36-P38) confirmed at an average of 173 units/week, reflecting a 42% decrease from the autumn peak average of 297.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a late-autumn deceleration phase (Nov 11). The high-volume autumn peak (P30-P35) which saw averages around 297 units has dropped to a sustained lower regime (P36-P39) averaging 168.5 units. Specifically, the last four periods show demand of 158, 182, 178, and 156. This stability justifies using a 'recent_N' approach to capture the post-peak mean. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals (e.g., P39 order arrived in P39). I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime (avg ~169, std ~13) ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the anticipated 168.5 units for the upcoming period while accounting for the reduced volatility compared to the autumn peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has entered a stable late-autumn regime. Following the high-volume autumn peak (P30-P35 average: 297 units), the last five periods (P36-P40) have shown a consistent stabilization around 169 units/week (158, 182, 178, 156, 170). The current date is mid-November, and while retail often sees a secondary spike for Black Friday/holidays, the recent 5-week history provides the most accurate 'baseline' for the current regime. I will use recent_N with N=5 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stabilize trend while accounting for the moderate week-to-week volatility (range 156-182). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime (P36-P40) confirmed stable at an average of 169 units/week, down from the 297 unit autumn peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable late-autumn demand regime following the September/October peak. Current date is late November (2019-11-25). Demand has been remarkably consistent over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), with an average of 169 units/week and a range of 156-182. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this current stable average (169.1), and 'recent_N' with N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility in this regime (std \u2248 10.3) compared to the preceding autumn peak. This strategy maintains high service levels for the consistent demand while avoiding excess inventory costs.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand management for Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019) must address a massive demand spike of 506 units in Period 42. This spike aligns with Black Friday/Cyber Monday seasonality (late November). Historical patterns show this is significantly higher than the late-autumn average of 169 units. Given the date, another spike or sustained high demand is likely due to the holiday shopping season (December). The previous period resulted in a complete stockout. I am setting L=0 as consistently observed, but using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this seasonal surge. I will forecast a mu_hat of 500 units to prepare for holiday volume, significantly above the previous regime's average, and set sigma_hat to 150 to manage the high volatility observed during peak events.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge detected: Period 42 demand spiked to 506 units (+200% vs late-autumn average of 169), confirming a transition from the stable autumn regime to a high-volume December holiday regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, entering the second week of December. Historically (Period 42), we saw a massive demand spike (506 units), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday or the start of holiday shopping. Period 43 demand dropped to 110 units, which is expected following a major peak. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. For the mu_hat parameter, I am using EWMA_gamma=0.7 to quickly adapt to the volatile holiday regime while smoothing out the post-peak drop in Period 43. This choice anticipates that demand will likely rebound as we approach Christmas, though it may not reach the 500+ unit extreme again immediately. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to capture the extreme variance observed between P41-P43 (171 to 506 to 110). On-hand inventory is healthy at 637 units, which provides a buffer against another spike while the EWMA settles.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand is highly volatile: Period 42 showed a 200% spike (506 units) followed by a sharp 78% drop in Period 43 (110 units), necessitating high-responsiveness forecasting (EWMA) to manage inventory through December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). Previous periods (P42-P44) have shown extreme volatility: a massive spike to 506 units followed by two weeks of low demand (~110-113 units). This pattern suggests early holiday shopping (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) followed by a temporary lull before the final pre-Christmas surge. With 524 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we are currently overstocked for the recent 113-unit pace but must protect against a potential end-of-year rush or post-holiday clearance demand. The Lead Time is consistently 0. I will use EWMA_gamma with a gamma of 0.4 to capture the recent high-volume trend while still giving weight to the holiday spike, ensuring base stock levels are sufficient if demand surges again in the final two periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand (P42-P44) is characterized by extreme high-volume volatility (range 110-506), inconsistent with the stable autumn regime of ~170 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1376.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Christmas/Holiday season (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical demand during this period has shown extreme volatility: a massive spike in Period 42 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact) to 506 units, followed by a sharp drop to ~100-110 units in Periods 43-45. Current on-hand inventory is 429 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, we can adjust our position instantly. However, since we've seen three consecutive periods of lower demand (around 100 units) following the initial holiday spike, we need to balance the risk of another pre-Christmas or post-Christmas clearance surge with the cost of holding excess inventory. I will use EWMA with a gamma of 0.7 to weigh the most recent deceleration heavily while still acknowledging the high volatility of the season. Based on recent demand of ~100 units and on-hand of 429, the capping mechanism in the OR backend will likely result in a zero order for this period to burn through existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand (P42-P45) is characterized by high-volume volatility (range 95-506), with the most recent three periods (P43-P45) stabilizing at a lower average of 106 units/week after the initial spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1049.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), concluding the December holiday season. Demand has significantly cooled and stabilized following the major spike in Period 42. Since that spike (506 units), the subsequent four periods (P43-P46) have shown much lower and relatively consistent demand: 110, 113, 95, and 75 units respectively (average ~98 units). This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 46 that demand is stabilizing at a lower level after the peak. Current on-hand inventory is 376 units, which is nearly four times the current weekly average, suggesting we are heavily overstocked for the current demand regime. With Lead Time confirmed consistently at 0, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-holiday stabilization. This will prevent the OR backend from ordering more units while we bleed off the excess inventory, minimizing further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration confirmed: Periods 43-46 show demand stabilizing at an average of 98 units/week, a 42% decrease from the late-autumn average of 169 and far below the 506-unit holiday spike.
