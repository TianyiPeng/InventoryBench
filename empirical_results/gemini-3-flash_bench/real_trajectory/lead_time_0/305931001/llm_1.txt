The last data point was lower (57), but the overall average is 70. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: Since the promised lead time is 0, I should order enough to cover Period 1 demand.
