Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 305931001 (Women's Faux Leather Leggings). The product description and early February dates suggest a winter/fashion item. Five historical demand points (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a mean of 70 units (83, 62, 67, 81, 57) with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2 unit. Promised lead time is 0. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, and the promised lead time is 0, we need to order enough for the backend to satisfy demand for the coming period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to focus on the current regime, as demand appears relatively stable between 57-83 units. For Lead Time, I will stick with the promised 'default' of 0 until observations suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the SKU 'Fake 1p Leggings', the product type (Leggings/Tights) and the date (mid-February) suggest standard late-winter demand with no immediate holiday spikes. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the prometed L=0 holds. Historical demand samples (83, 62, 67, 81, 57) plus Period 1 demand (50) show a mean around 66.6 and a standard deviation around 12.7. Since we only have 6 data points (5 historical + P1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent history (including the slightly lower P1 demand of 50). This should provide a stable forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat while maintaining sufficient stock for L+1 (1 period) of demand. With profit=1 and holding=1, the service level q is 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is women's leggings (leggings/tights). Historical demand samples are [83, 62, 67, 81, 57], with actual demand in Period 1 = 50 and Period 2 = 83. The mean of all historical samples (including P1 and P2) is approximately 69. The promised lead time is 0, and observations from P1 and P2 confirm that orders arrive in the same period (actual lead time = 0). In Period 2, we stocked out (on-hand 0, sold 67 vs demand 83) because the OR engine's previous parameters likely underestimated demand or volatility. Given the current date is late February, we are moving away from deep winter but still in a peak period for leggings/tights. Demand remains relatively volatile. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations (67, 81, 57, 50, 83) and recent_N for sigma to ensure we have enough safety stock to prevent another stockout, effectively aiming for a higher service level since profit equals holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 305931001 (Imitation leather leggings) is currently in early March. Based on the historical demand samples (83, 62, 67, 81, 57) and the first three game periods (50, 83, 70), the demand is relatively stable with an average around 70 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time has consistently been 0. However, the last two periods resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that the OR engine's 'cap' or the base stock calculation is too tight for the high variability (demand spiked to 83 in Period 2). Because Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the backend targets the median demand. To prevent stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (including game history) to capture the current mean, and I'll use 5 for sigma_hat to reflect the observed volatility. I will stick with the default lead time of 0 as it is verified.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings' (Womens Socks & Tights). Current status is Period 5 (March 11, 2019). Historical demand samples (83, 62, 67, 81, 57) and realized demand in the game (50, 83, 70, 61) show a relatively stable pattern with an average of approximately 68 units/period. The promised lead time is 0, and all history confirms an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals occur in the same period as orders). Based on the profit/holding cost ratio ($1.0/$1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine targets the median demand to balance lost sales against holding costs. Since the demand is stable and lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent history (last 4 game periods plus available samples) to estimate parameters. N=5 is chosen for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent performance while maintaining enough data for variance calculation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather), which is a fashion-oriented item. Looking at the demand history (samples + game history), the demand has been relatively stable: 83, 62, 67, 81, 57 (samples) and 50, 83, 70, 61, 66 (last 5 periods). The mean of the recent 5 periods in the game is 66, while the overall sample mean is 70. There is no evidence of a strong seasonal shift yet for mid-March. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived same-period). Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), so q = 0.5, implying the OR engine will target the median demand (base stock = mu_hat). Since lead time is 0, the backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat. I will set L to 0 using 'default', mu_hat to (1+0) times the mean of all samples (including history) using 'default', and sigma_hat using 'default'. Current on-hand is 0, and there is no pipeline inventory, so the OR engine will place an order to reach the base stock level.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather), which typically sees stable demand in early spring (March) before tapering off as weather warms. Historical demand samples (including the seed data) range from 50 to 83. The mean of the 6 concluded periods is 63.5, and the mean of the 5 seed samples is 70.0. Most importantly, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am currently at Period 7 (March 25). Demand in the last two weeks (Periods 5 and 6) was 66 and 51 respectively. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning the base stock should align closely with the expected mean demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual performance in the live environment while honoring the consistent 0-period lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings' (Womens Nightwear/Socks & Tights category). Current date is April 1st. Historical demand for the last 5 pre-game weeks averaged 70 units. Game performance (Period 1-7) shows an average demand of 60. Demand has slowed recently (Periods 6-7 average is 45), potentially reflecting a post-winter seasonal decline for imitation leather leggings as warmer weather approaches. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 7 concluded periods. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.5; however, the OR backend's capped policy will ensure stock based on the parameters provided. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent variation.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather), which typically sees higher demand in late winter and early spring but may face a slight decline as temperatures rise in April. Historical demand samples (83, 62, 67, 81, 57) and recent in-game performance (50, 83, 70, 61, 66, 51, 39, 47) show a mean demand of 60.5 over the last 13 observations. However, the last two weeks (39, 47) suggest a slight softening compared to the earlier weeks where demand often exceeded 60. I will adopt a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (the full in-game history) to capture the current active demand regime while smoothing out the minor fluctuations. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. I will maintain L=0. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand. A recent_N=8 approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balanced estimate that reacts to the recent slight downward trend while maintaining enough stock to cover common demand spikes.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather). Historically, demand was higher in Jan/Feb (avg ~70) but has dropped and stabilized over the last three weeks (Periods 7-9) to an average of 43.7. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met in all concluded periods (1-9). Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, meaning it will target the median demand. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower-demand regime (Periods 7, 8, 9 demand: 39, 47, 45). On-hand inventory is 14, and there are no units in-transit, so the OR engine will calculate an order to reach the new base stock levels immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 7: Average weekly demand decreased from ~65 to ~44 (-32%) following the end of winter/early spring.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fake 1p Leggings' is experiencing a sustained downward demand trend as we move further into spring (late April). The carry-over insight noted a shift around Period 7, and recent demand samples (P7: 39, P8: 47, P9: 45, P10: 29) confirm a lower average of approximately 40 units per period compared to the initial 65-70. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 7-10) and ensure the inventory levels are optimized for the prevailing spring demand rather than the higher winter historical data.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather), which traditionally experiences higher demand in colder months. The Carry-over Insight confirmed a demand drop starting Period 7 (~44 units/week). Looking at the most recent demand samples (P7-P11: 39, 47, 45, 29, 22), there is a further downward trend as we move deeper into spring, with the average of the last 3 periods dropping to ~32. Since 2019/4/22 demand was 22, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this transition from the early spring average of 44 down toward current lower levels. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 11 weeks of history, so I will maintain 'default'. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the stabilization in variance as demand levels out at this lower tier.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift continues lower: 3-period rolling average (P9-P11) fell to 32 units, down from the P7 regime average of 44, matching late-spring seasonal expectations for imitation leather leggings.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is highly seasonal. As we move further into spring/summer, demand has significantly dropped from a winter average of ~70 to a recent 3-period average of ~26.6 (P10-P12). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time is 0. With holding costs equal to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning it aims to satisfy median demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this low-demand regime (approx. 27 units/week) without over-restocking, as seasonal trends suggest no immediate recovery for imitation leather leggings in May.

Carry-over insight: Established low-demand regime: Demand stabilized at ~27 units/week over P10-P12 (29, 22, 29), down from the ~44 unit average earlier in spring (P7-P9).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th, 2019. The product, 'Leggings in imitation leather', is a cold-weather fashion item currently experiencing seasonally low demand as temperatures rise. Historical demand (P1-P13) shows a clear downward trend: Period 1-6 averaged ~65 units, Period 7-9 averaged ~44 units, and the most recent regime (P10-P13) has averaged 28 units (29, 22, 29, 32). In Period 13, demand (32) exceeded stock-outs (27), confirming that interest remains but at a significantly lower level than early spring. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this low-demand regime over the last 4 periods, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current seasonal baseline while allowing for enough volatility (sigma) to capture small spikes like the 32 units seen last period. Lead time remains default (0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product (imitation leather leggings) is entering late spring/early summer, a period with typically lower demand for this category. However, observed demand in the last two periods (P13: 32, P14: 35) has shown a slight uptick compared to the previous low-demand regime (P10-P12 average: 26.6), suggesting a stabilization slightly higher than the record lows. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 0 units in-transit. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout history. To capture the most recent stabilized demand level while hedging against the slight recent increase and potential stock-outs (as seen in P13 and P14), I will use the last 5 samples (P10-P14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation (N=5). This N includes the lower stability of P10-P12 and the recent slight increases, providing a balanced target for the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed slight uptick: Period 13-14 demand averaged 33.5 units, compared to Period 10-12 average of 26.6 (+26%).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is currently in a late-spring seasonal context (late May). Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Historical demand showed a significant drop in late March/April (down to ~27 units/week) but has recently stabilized at a slightly higher level. Over the last three periods (P13-P15), demand has been 32, 35, and 34 units respectively, resulting in stockouts because the orders (19, 28, 30) were insufficient to cover this demand. The average demand over these last 3 periods is 33.67. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50%, making accurate mean estimation critical. I will use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent established baseline of ~34 units and the low variability associated with it, ensuring we order enough to satisfy the current slightly higher demand while avoiding excessive inventory as we approach summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher May baseline: Average demand for P13-P15 is 33.7 units, compared to P10-P12 average of 26.6 (+27%).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is currently in Period 17 (early June). Historical demand analysis shows a recent upward trend from the late-spring low: demand for P13-P15 averaged ~34, followed by a jump to 43 in P16. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P13-P16) is 36. This suggests that while imitation leather is typically a cooler-weather item, there is a sustained late-spring/early-summer baseline of approx 36-40 units. Inventory is currently zero, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid the stockouts seen in the last 4 consecutive periods (where demand exceeded inventory), I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture this recent increase without being overly influenced by the much higher winter demand or the very low April demand. I will use N=4 for sigma_hat as well to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Recovery from late-April lows, with average demand increasing from 26.6 (P10-12) to 36.0 (P13-16), a 35% increase.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is currently in Period 18 (June 10th). Historically, demand for this item dropped significantly from its winter/early spring peak (avg ~65) to a late April low (avg ~27). Recent evidence from Periods 13-16 suggested a recovery to an average of 36.0. However, Period 17 showed a lower demand of 23 units, which may indicate that the 'recovery' was a temporary fluctuation rather than a new sustained high. Given that June is usually a trough for heavy synthetic materials like imitation leather, I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the P13-17 window (32, 35, 34, 43, 23), yielding an average demand of 33.4. This more recent average is appropriate as it balances the brief May uptick against the more logical seasonal decline. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0, matching the promised lead time, so method 'default' is used for L.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is imitation leather leggings, which typically see a sharp decline in demand during the peak summer months due to their material and style. Recent history confirms this downward trend: demand dropped from a stabilized level of ~36 units (P13-P16) to 23 units in P17 and 17 units in P18. The average of the last two periods is 20 units, reflecting a clear seasonal cooling. With 17 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to adjust my forecast to prevent excessive holding costs, as lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent downward shift (mean of last 3 periods: 27.6; mean of last 2: 20). Using N=3 allows the OR backend to react to the decline while maintaining enough safety stock to avoid stockouts if demand fluctuates slightly above the current low trend.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal decline confirmed: Demand shifted from an average of 36.0 (P13-16) to 20.0 (P17-18) as temperatures rise, consistent with women's imitation leather leggings category.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24, mid-summer. The SKU is imitation leather leggings, a product highly sensitive to warm weather. History demonstrates a clear downward shift in demand as temperatures rise: P13-16 averaged 36.0 units, but P17-19 have averaged 19.3 units (23, 17, 18), confirming the summer seasonal decline previously identified. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 10 and demand trending around 18-20 units per week, I will continue to use a recent_N strategy (N=3) to capture this lower summer demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering as we enter the height of summer.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor established: Period 17-19 demand stabilized at an average of 19.3, down 46% from the May average of 36.0, reflecting the seasonal irrelevance of leather leggings in hot weather.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer low-demand regime for imitation leather leggings (Date: 2019/7/1). Demand has steadily declined from a May average of 36.0 units to a summer baseline. The last four periods (P17-P20) show demand values of 23, 17, 18, and 11. The average for the last three periods (P18-P20) is 15.3 units. As we are in the peak of summer (July), this lower baseline is expected to remain stable or potentially decrease further. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent low-demand regime (avg ~17.25). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history (P17-P20). With 9 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain service levels for this low-volume period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's imitation leather leggings, which are highly seasonal. We are currently in early July (Period 22), the deep summer off-season for this category. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the spring. A review of recent demand (P17-P21) shows values of 23, 17, 18, 11, and 19 units, yielding a 5-period average of 17.6 units. The most recent demand (P21) was 19. Inventory is currently at 0 (on-hand and in-transit), with a stockout occurring last period (sold 18 against demand of 19). Despite the stockout, holding costs are equal to profit margins ($1.00), meaning the OR backend's service level target (critical ratio) is 0.50 (50%). This suggests we should avoid overstocking during this low-demand summer phase. I will use a recent_N calculation with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this current summer regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) is currently in a deep summer seasonal trough. Demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has averaged 17.3 units, significantly lower than the May average of 36. This aligns with the 'Summer demand floor' noted in Carry-over insights. Recent demand data (P20-P22: 11, 19, 16) yields an average of 15.3 units. Given the product category and the current date (July 15th), no immediate demand recovery is expected until late August or September. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level in this low-demand environment, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the summer baseline (approx. 17.3 units per period). This N covers the entire summer regime from Period 17 onwards.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is in the middle of its summer seasonal low. The current date is July 22, 2019. Historical demand data and carry-over insights confirm that demand significantly dropped from a May average of ~36 units to a summer floor. Recent demand for periods 21-23 was 19, 16, and 9 units respectively (average 14.7). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). With profit and holding costs both at $1.0, the critical ratio is 50%, meaning we aim for a base stock targeting the median demand. Currently, there are 9 units on hand. To accurately track this low-demand summer regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 (P19-P23) to capture the trend of 18, 11, 19, 16, 9 (average ~14.6). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 14-15 units of demand without overstocking during the low season.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', a seasonal item typically for colder weather. We are currently in late July (Period 25, 2019/7/29). Demand has continued to decline significantly throughout the summer. Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), demand has been 11, 19, 16, 9, 7, averaging 12.4. Over the last 3 periods (P22-P24), the average is 10.7. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) and the steady downward trend as we hit the hottest part of summer, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the current low-demand floor (approx 11 units) while minimizing excess stock that would incur heavy holding costs. A N=5 window for mu_hat provides a safe buffer against minor fluctuations while acknowledging the late-July slump.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand decline reached a new low: Period 22-24 demand averaged 10.7 units, down from the June average of ~19 (P17-19), reflecting peak seasonal irrelevance for imitation leather leggings in late July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is currently in a deep summer seasonal trough, which is expected for this product category during August. Demand has consistently declined over the last few periods: P22 (16), P23 (9), P24 (7), and P25 (4). The current on-hand inventory is 9 units, which already covers more than two weeks of the most recent demand levels. Given that the promised and actual lead times are 0, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (average ~6.7 units) to reflect this low-demand baseline while maintaining lean inventory to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit/period) on a slow-moving item. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a 50% service level, which is appropriate for minimizing total cost during a seasonal low.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the SKU's seasonal trough for 'imitation leather leggings' which are typically worn in cooler weather. Period 26 demand (16) showed a sudden spike compared to the immediate prior weeks (4, 7, 9 units), but this is likely a small fluctuation rather than a trend reversal, as August remains hot. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Historically, actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' adjustment. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low summer demand (mean ~10.4) while acknowledging the recent uptick. This ensures the base stock covers the immediate expected demand without over-ordering as we approach the end of summer.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand for 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather) showed a significant summer trough (P22-P25 avg: ~9 units), but has recently exhibited a sharp upward trend as we approach late August/early September (P26 demand: 16, P27 demand: 27). This matches the seasonal transition from peak summer to early fall shopping, where heavier fabrics like imitation leather regain relevance. Because the current inventory is 0 and demand is rapidly accelerating (P27 demand was more than double the late-July average), I am increasing mu_hat using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the immediate velocity of the fall recovery (averaging ~16.7 units/week). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. The OR engine will use these parameters to rebuild inventory levels that were depleted during the unexpected demand spike in P26-P27.

Carry-over insight: Early fall seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand increased from a summer low average of 10.7 (P22-24) to 21.5 (P26-27), a 100% increase, as of mid-August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are moving into the fall season, which is historically a strong growth period for imitation leather leggings as temperatures drop. Current demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) was 16, 27, and 22, averaging 21.7 units. This is a significant recovery from the late July low of ~10 units. Given the transition into September, let's anticipate a continued upward trend. The inventory is currently 0, and lead time has remained consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent seasonal recovery while the backend's 'cap' mechanism prevents over-ordering. I will slightly increase the forecast to 25 units/week (total mu_hat of 25 for L=0) to ensure we meet rising demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (2019/9/2). Current on-hand is 10 units with no pipeline. The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is highly seasonal. According to 'Carry-over Insights', we saw an early fall recovery in late August (P26-28 average demand was ~21.7). However, Period 29 demand dropped to 15. Looking at the broader calendar, early September is the start of the core fall ramp-up for clothing. I expect demand to continue trending upward from the summer lows. Since lead time has consistently been 0, I will keep L=0. For mu_hat, the 'recent_N' approach (N=4) captures the transition from peak summer lows (P25: 4) into the early fall recovery (P26-29: 16, 27, 22, 15), yielding a mean of 20.0 for (1+L). Given the volatility during these seasonal shifts (4 to 27), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the recent variance.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. This SKU (imitation leather leggings) is entering its primary fall peak season. Historically, demand was high in early spring (P1-P6 averaged ~65 units) and hit a summer trough (P22-P25 averaged ~9 units). The most recent period (P30) saw a significant spike to 39 units, confirming the fall recovery trend noted in carry-over insights. To capture this upward seasonal momentum while maintaining responsiveness, I am shifting from 'recent_N' to an 'EWMA_gamma' of 0.7 for mu_hat. This higher weight on recent samples (especially the P30 jump) will allow the base stock to scale quickly for the fall/winter demand increase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with the start of a peak season.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal surge confirmed: Period 30 demand (39 units) is significantly higher than the August average (~21 units) and July average (~9 units), indicating the start of the peak sales window for leather leggings.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product (imitation leather leggings) is entering its peak fall seasonal demand window. Carry-over insights and recent history (P30: 39, P31: 46) confirm a significant demand surge compared to the summer lows (P22-P25 average ~9). The demand in P31 reached 46 units, which is consistent with the early spring peak (P2: 83). Given the rapid week-over-week growth (15 -> 39 -> 46), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 55 units. This anticipates continued growth as cooler weather sets in. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this transition. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as shipments have consistently arrived in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal surge accelerating: Late August/Early September demand increased from 15 (P29) to 46 (P31), representing a 200% increase in three weeks as weather cools.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is experiencing a sharp seasonal surge as we enter late September (late fall transition). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Demand has increased dramatically from the summer low (avg ~10) to recent levels of 39, 46, and 51 (P30-P32). This trend indicates a return to the early-year high-demand regime (which averaged 64 units between P1 and P6). Given the current upward slope, I anticipate demand for Period 33 will exceed the most recent sample of 51. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 58 units (a ~15% increase over the last observed period) to ensure the base stock is sufficient to meet this growth and avoid stockouts seen in Periods 30 and 31. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the current high volatility of the seasonal upswing.

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal surge is accelerating: Demand has risen for three consecutive weeks (39, 46, 51), returning to early-year peak levels (observed average 45.3 over P30-P32 compared to August average of ~20).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for imitation leather leggings has entered a major seasonal surge as we enter late September/early October. Period 33 demand spiked to 119 units, which is more than double the previous week's demand (51) and significantly higher than the early-period peak (83). This clearly demonstrates a high-demand regime driven by the cooling weather and fall fashion cycle. Based on the 3-period trend (46, 51, 119), a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 is selected to capture this rapid acceleration. Current inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 33 where demand (119) far exceeded supply (58). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this peak, the parameters will be set to aggressive levels based on the most recent 3-period average (~72 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Fall seasonal peak confirmed with extreme spike: Period 33 demand increased to 119 units, compared to the P30-P32 average of 45.3 (+162%), indicating the product has entered its primary sales window.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) has entered its peak seasonal window (October). Demand in the last two periods (P33 and P34) was exceptionally high at 119 and 78 units respectively, resulting in stockouts despite raising the orders. The average demand for the last four periods (P31-P34) is 73.5, compared to 36.3 for the four periods prior. We are currently in a stockout position (on-hand = 0). Since the lead time is consistently 0, we must set params to meet the current week's expected high demand. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~73.5 units per period) while maintaining a high sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the P33 spike (demand=119).

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal demand regime for October: Average demand for P31-P34 reached 73.5 units (+100% vs early Sept average of 36.3), with a single-week peak of 119 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) is in its peak seasonal window (October). Recent demand has been significantly higher than the annual average, with samples from P33-P35 being 119, 78, and 84. Although there was a massive spike of 119 in P33, demand seems to have settled into a high-plateau regime around 80 units per week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. With a promised and historical lead time of 0, I must set parameters to satisfy the high demand expected in Period 36. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this peak regime (Avg of P33-P35 = 93.7). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the high volatility seen during this surge (Std Dev of P33-P35 = 22.1). This will ensure the base stock level is high enough to minimize lost sales during this profitable peak window.

Carry-over insight: October peak demand regime: Average demand for P33-P35 stabilized at 93.7 units, reflecting the primary sales window for leather leggings.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is currently in its peak fall/winter seasonal window (October). Analysis of demand from Period 33 to 36 (119, 78, 84, 57) shows a high but volatile regime, following the extreme spike in P33. The average for the last four periods is 84.5 units per week. Although P36 saw a dip to 57 units, the start-of-year history (P1-P4) showed demand levels in the 60-80 range during similar cool weather, suggesting that the current regime is the new baseline for the season. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current seasonal peak while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed during this surge, I am using recent_N with N=4 to cover the window since the P33 spike, ensuring the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) is sufficient to handle potential demand rebounds back toward the 80-100 range.

Carry-over insight: October peak demand regime (P33-P36) average is 84.5 units, significantly higher than the September average of 45.3, confirming full seasonal rotation into the peak sales window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is currently in its peak seasonal window (October). Analysis of recent demand shows a stabilized peak regime: Period 33-37 demand values are 119, 78, 84, 57, and 85. The average demand across these last 5 periods (P33-P37) is 84.6 units. While Period 36 was lower (57), Period 37 immediately rebounded to 85, suggesting the high demand remains sustained. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this peak average (approx 85 units per period). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility (33.5 std) observed during this spike. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the OR engine needs to order the full base stock to cover the expected demand and the service level buffer.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is currently in its peak seasonal window (November). Historical demand patterns show a significant escalation starting in September/October. Recent periods (P33-P38) show a mean demand of approximately 88.5 units, with a notable spike to 108 units in the most recent period (P38). Since lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period as ordered), I will set L=0. To ensure the base-stock level accounts for the current high-demand regime and potential further holiday spikes, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the most recent demand level (108) and a conservative sigma_hat based on the recent volatility observed during this peak phase (P33-P38 std is ~22). This allows the OR backend to maintain a sufficient service level for this high-margin peak period.

Carry-over insight: November peak demand confirmed: Period 38 demand reached 108 units, consistent with the late-fall peak for leather leggings. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P33-P38) is 88.5 units, up from the September average of 45.3.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (imitation leather leggings) is in its peak November demand regime. Recent demand observations for P33-P39 are 119, 78, 84, 57, 85, 108, and 70. The 7-period average during this peak window is 85.8 units/week. While demand decreased to 70 in P39, this follows a high of 108 in P38, suggesting continued high volatility within the peak season rather than a decline. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level during this profitable peak window while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 (N=7 to capture the full peak window since the late-September surge). Starting on-hand is 40 units, and there is no in-transit inventory. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the high demand and provide a safety buffer against the significant variance seen in this regime (e.g., the jump from 57 to 85 to 108).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is in its peak seasonal window (November). Demand has stabilized significantly higher since Period 33. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 78.6 units. Specifically, the last two periods saw demand of 70 and 74 units, indicating a relatively stable high-demand regime as we approach late November. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Based on the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 50%, although the OR backend's capping logic and safety stock calculation will modulate this. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P36-P40) captures the current stabilized peak demand (average ~79), while sigma_hat with N=5 captures the recent volatility in this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: November peak demand stability: Average weekly demand for P36-P40 is 78.6 units, showing relative stability in the peak fall/winter sales window compared to the extreme 119-unit spike in October.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is currently in its peak seasonal window (late November). Recent demand (P36-P41) has been robust, ranging from 57 to 108 units, with the most recent demand at 93. The 3-period average (P39-P41) is approximately 79 units, while the 6-period average (P36-P41) is 81 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and the backend logic for base_stock uses z*\xb7sigma_hat, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the established late-fall demand level (~81 units) and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to account for the high volatility seen in this peak window (standard deviation is high due to fluctuations between 57 and 108). This ensures sufficient stock to meet the high demand while acknowledging the current peak season.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 (Nov 25) spiked tremendously to 191 units, far exceeding the recent stable average of roughly 78.6\u201388.5 units. This is highly consistent with Black Friday / Cyber Monday week in the 'Womens Nightwear, Socks & Tights' and 'Leggings' category. Given this is a seasonal spike rather than a permanent regime shift, and we are now moving into the first week of December, demand is expected to remain high during the holiday season but likely retreat from the extreme Black Friday peak. The last 7 periods (P36-P42) average 96.8 units (including the spike), while P36-P41 averaged 78.6. I will set mu_hat to capture the elevated winter regime while acknowledging the spike. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this seasonal strength. Historically, lead time has remained 0 periods consistently, so I will maintain L=0 (default). Sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=7 to account for the increased volatility seen during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed at Period 42 (191 units), marking the extreme peak of the winter seasonal window for imitation leather leggings.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak winter seasonal window for imitation leather leggings. Period 42 saw a massive spike (191 units) due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, and Period 43 remained very high at 128 units. These two periods signify a shift from the previous 'October/November baseline' of ~80 units to a 'Peak Holiday' regime. The current on-hand inventory is 0. With lead time L=0, we need to set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the current period. Given the immediate post-Cyber Monday context (early December), demand is likely to stay elevated but perhaps slightly lower than the extreme P42 peak. An explicit mu_hat of 120 (approximate average of P43 and the high-demand periods in November) combined with an explicit sigma_hat of 45 (to account for the high volatility seen recently) will allow the OR backend to target a sufficient base stock for this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Period 42-43 demand averaged 159.5 units, a 100% increase over the P36-P41 average of 78.6, reflecting peak December shopping for the leggings category.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing the late-winter peak for imitation leather leggings. Historical data shows extreme volatility and high demand in late Q4: Period 42 (191, Black Friday week), Period 43 (128), and Period 44 (137). The current demand regime (P42-P44) has an average of 152 units, which is significantly higher than the earlier November average of ~80. However, the game concludes in two periods (P47), and late-December demand often sees a sharp post-holiday drop as inventory clearance begins and seasonal relevance fades. To maximize profit while minimizing terminal holding costs, I will move away from the extreme spike of 152 units towards a slightly more conservative forecast. I'll use recent_N with N=3 to capture the high-demand state (P42-P44) but will choose mu_hat and sigma_hat carefully to cover potential high demand without overstocking at the end of the game life. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the final peak/tail-end of the winter holiday season for imitation leather leggings. Historical data shows that demand peaked significantly around Black Friday (P42: 191 units) and stayed high through mid-December (P44: 137, P45: 137). However, as we reach December 23rd, we anticipate a post-Christmas drop-off consistent with fashion seasonality, where winter wear demand begins to decline as retailers pivot toward clearance and spring transitions. The average demand for the most recent holiday peak (P42-P45) is 148.25 units. Given that the product is a winter-focused item (leggings in imitation leather), I expect demand to remain relatively high but start tapering off. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand levels while maintaining a slightly aggressive stock position to avoid stockouts on any remaining holiday sales. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for 'just-in-time' ordering. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility observed during the December peaks.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday seasonal decline expected: Historically, demand for this winter category (leather leggings) peaks in Nov/Dec and should begin cooling in late December/January.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical demand for imitation leather leggings typically peaks in Nov/Dec and experiences a significant decline in January as the winter season wanes. The demand in Period 46 (112 units) already shows a decline from the mid-December peak (137 units in P44-P45). Given the seasonal transition, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit forecast of 80 units for the next period, reflecting a continued 'post-holiday' cooldown. Lead time (L) remains 0. Current on-hand is 37 units, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock for this new lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday seasonal decline confirmed at Period 46: Demand dropped from 137 (P44-45 average) to 112 (-18%), signaling the end of the peak winter window for imitation leather leggings.
