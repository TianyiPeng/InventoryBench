Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this item (Womens 5-pocket skinny jeans) shows a clear upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 59, 78, 96, 123, 144. This indicates a strong growth regime as we move into the spring season. Since the promised lead time is 0, the base stock calculation must cover the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this recent growth trend while acknowledging the increasing variance. The default lead time of 0 is used as there is no historical evidence yet to suggest deviation from the promised timing.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Luna skinny RW', a staple item (5-pocket jeans). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 59, 78, 96, 123, 144 (pre-game samples) and 107 in Period 1. The average of the last 3 samples (including P1) is (123 + 144 + 107) / 3 = 124.7. The promised lead time is 0, and Period 1 confirmed an actual lead time of 0. Given the steady growth in the pre-game data, the dip in P1 (107 vs 144) might be a weekly fluctuation rather than a regime shift, but we should stay responsive. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels while accounting for the recent high-volume weeks. Setting L=0 as confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans (everyday collection). Current date is 2019-02-25. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a clear upward trend: 59, 78, 96, 123, 144. However, Period 1 (107) and Period 2 (75) demand decreased from the peak seen in early February (144). Observed lead time is 0 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to capture the recent leveling of demand compared to the initial steep climb, focusing on the last 5 samples (P-3, P-2, P-1, P1, P2) which include both the pre-game peak and the in-game stabilization. This balances the recent slowdown with the overall higher base level established in February.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans), an everyday staple. Analyzing the demand history (samples + game history): 59, 78, 96, 123, 144 (pre-game), then 107, 75, 52 (Periods 1-3). There is a clear downward trend following a peak around early February. This suggests we are moving out of a high-demand period. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (observed lead times for P1, P2, P3 were all 0). Current on-hand is 80 units. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current descending regime, setting N=3. For sigma, I will use 'default' to stay conservative until volatility stabilizes. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $225.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 begins on 2019-03-11. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' skinny jean. Historical demand shows an upward trend in January (59-144) followed by a stabilizing but slightly declining 'everyday' pattern in February/early March (Periods 1-4 demand: 107, 75, 52, 66). The mean demand over the last 4 periods is 75. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promise. Since there are no in-transit units and on-hand inventory is 39, I need to set parameters to ensure enough stock for Period 5 demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand level while being responsive to the recent variations. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed variability in the current season.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans), which is a staple item with relatively stable demand. The current period is 2019-03-18. Looking at the demand history (107, 75, 52, 66, 55), we observed a spike in Period 1 (late winter/early spring transition) followed by a more stable pattern around a mean of ~62 units in the last four periods. There are no immediate major retail holidays in mid-March that would cause an extreme spike, but maintaining a slight buffer for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' is prudent. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect the stabilization after the initial P1 spike, while keeping L at the default (0).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans (everyday collection), which usually sees stable demand outside of major seasonal shifts. The current date is March 25, 2019. Historical demand over the last 5 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 61.2 units (75, 52, 66, 55, 58). Period 1 was an outlier at 107. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Ending on-hand inventory is low at 13 units. I will prioritize the most recent 5 periods (Periods 2-6) to exclude the initial Period 1 surge, setting the OR parameters to maintain coverage for this steady 'everyday' demand while account for the 0-period lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Luna skinny RW' (women's 5-pocket jeans), which is a staple item. Current period is 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Historically, lead time has stayed consistent at 0 periods (same-period arrival), which aligns with the promised lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-7 plus pre-game samples) shows a downward trend from the initial samples (avg ~100) to a more stable recent regime. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P3-P7) show demand values of 52, 66, 55, 58, 55, which is quite stable with a mean of 57.2. Using N=5 forRecent demand captures this stabilization after the early February peak. Since L=0, mu_hat will represent demand for (1+0)=1 period. On-hand inventory is low (15 units) compared to the stable demand mean (~57), so an order is expected from the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at ~57 units per period starting Period 3 (Avg P3-P7: 57.2) following a higher initial period in February.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is women's skinny jeans. Recent demand has stabilized: excluding the higher initial February periods (P1 and P2), the average demand from Period 3 through Period 8 is 58.33 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P5-P8) have seen demand of 55, 58, 55, and 64, representing a very stable regime with a mean of 58.0 and low volatility. Period 8 ended with 0 inventory due to demand (64) exceeding availability (62), suggesting a slight stockout loss. I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean and volatility with N=6 to capture this stable post-February period, while letting the backend calculate the lead time which has consistently stayed at 0 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans. Demand has been stable since Period 3, averaging 57.4 units (P3-P9 range: 52-66). Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, confirmed by every order from Period 1 to 9 arriving in the same period it was placed. Starting inventory is 11 units, which is significantly lower than a single period's average demand (57), necessitating an order. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stable demand regime that began in Period 3, ignoring the higher initial volume in February (Periods 1 and 2). This ensures base stock covers expected demand for Period 10 without overstocking based on outdated high early-February data.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for these skinny jeans has been stabilized for several weeks. Following the higher demand in February (P1-P2: 107, 75), the mean demand for Periods 3 through 10 is approximately 55.6 units. The most recent demand in Period 10 was 43, continuing a slight downward trend seen from Period 8 (64) and Period 9 (52). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as every order placed has arrived within the same period. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime established since Period 3, ignoring the initial high-demand launch/February phase, while reflecting the current stable-to-slightly-decreasing demand trend. This allows the OR engine to set a base stock that covers expected demand while accounting for the recent variance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's everyday denim) has been gradually declining over the last four periods (Demands: 64, 52, 43, 38). This suggests a potential shift away from the earlier stable regime of ~57 units per period identified in Carry-over Insights at Period 8. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently show actual lead time is 0. With inventory at 24 units and demand trending downward, I will use a shorter window (N=4) for demand mu_hat to capture the recent decline while maintaining sufficient stock. The sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 4 periods to reflect the current variability. Lead time L will remain at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average weekly demand decreased from 57 to 49 (Avg P9-P11: 44.3) with a downward trend following the April peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Womens 5-pocket jeans) is in a clear downward trend as we move further into May, likely due to seasonal shifts. Following the demand regime shift identified at Period 9, weekly demand has fallen from 52 to 27 (P9-P12: 52, 43, 38, 27). The average for these last 4 periods is 40 units, but the most recent observation of 27 suggests a continued decline. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed. To account for this downward trend while maintaining a buffer for demand volatility, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the post-shift average, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the recent increase in variability during this decline. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected lower demand while preventing excessive stockouts if the decline levels off.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend intensified downward: P12 demand (27) is 50% lower than the P3-P7 average (57). Regime P9-P12 average is 40.0 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. The product is a pair of skinny jeans, a basic wardrobe staple. Historically, demand for this item has been declining since April, with the recent Period 13 demand (59) being a notable spike compared to the downward trend observed in Periods 9-12 (avg: 40). However, Period 13 concluded with a stockout (on-hand 0, sold 49 of 59 demand) because the order size based on the previous downward trend was insufficient to cover the sudden jump. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 13 concluded cycles. I need to balance the recent downward regime (N=5: Periods 9-13 avg = 43.8) against the sudden spike. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the recent average and the increased volatility introduced by the Period 13 spike, while ensuring the OR backend's service level logic accounts for the current stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 13: Demand spiked to 59 units after a 4-period declining trend (Periods 9-12, avg 40.0), causing a stockout.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-late May (2019-05-20). The demand for woman's 'Luna skinny RW' jeans (SKU 562245062) has shown a significant rebound over the last two periods (Period 13: 59 units, Period 14: 63 units) following a low in Period 12 (27 units). This rebound has led to two consecutive stockouts as inventories were tuned for the previous lower-demand regime. The current average demand over the last two periods is 61. For Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To recover service levels and meet this renewed demand trend, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward shift (Avg P12-P14: 49.7), but apply an explicit sigma_hat of 12 (derived from the volatility of the recent shift) to provide a safety buffer against continued growth or variability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed: Recent average demand (P13-P14) is 61 units, representing a >50% increase from the P9-P12 average (40.0). Consecutive stockouts in P13-P14.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 (Womens Jeans) is experiencing a sharp demand rebound and sustained stockouts. Period 15 demand was 74 units, continuing a 3-period trend of increasing demand (P13: 59, P14: 63, P15: 74) after a late-April slump. The current average demand for this new regime (P13-P15) is 65.3 units, significantly higher than the previous carry-over insight of 61 units. The zero on-hand inventory and consecutive stockouts indicate the OR backend's cap is too restrictive based on historical statistics. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 70 (based on the latest demand unit + a small buffer to break the stockout cycle) and use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed and intensifying: Period 15 demand reached 74 units. Current regime (P13-P15) average is 65.3, compared to P9-P12 average of 40.0 (+63%). Three consecutive stockouts (P13-P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/06/03), we evaluate the demand for SKU 562245062. The previous trend of increasing demand and stockouts (Periods 13-15) was broken in Period 16, where demand dropped to 48 units. This indicates the 'rebound' identified in previous carry-over insights may have stabilized or peaked. The average demand for the most recent regime (P13-P16) is 61 units (59, 63, 74, 48), while the average of the last two periods (P15-P16) is also 61 units. Using N=4 captures the full breadth of the recent volatility while reflecting the current higher-than-April average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the recent spike while acknowledging the latest softening, maintaining a service level that prevents the repeat of previous stockouts during this volatile phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 13 stabilized in Period 16: Regime P13-P16 average is 61.0 units, contrasting with the P9-P12 average of 40.0. Stockout streak ended in P16.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (2019/6/10), we are observing a significant cooldown in demand for product 562245062 (Womens 5-pocket jeans). Following a peak in late May (Period 15: 74 units), demand has dropped consecutively to 48 and then 34 in Period 17. The current demand (34) is significantly lower than the P13-P16 average of 61.0. This suggests the recovery regime has peaked and is now normalizing or entering a summer lull. My lead time analysis shows that the actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent two-period drop, I am shifting from the high 'recovery' forecast to a more moderate one. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent high volatility while acknowledging the downward trend (P13-P17 avg is 55.6). To protect against the high variability seen in the last 5 periods (demands of 59, 63, 74, 48, 34), I will also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to ensure we maintain enough buffer to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 13-15 if demand spikes again.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: The post-May rebound is cooling, with demand dropping from a peak of 74 (P15) to 34 (P17). Current 2-period average (41.0) is 33% lower than the P13-P16 average (61.0).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for item 562245062 (Womens Luna skinny jeans) shows a cooling period following a significant rebound that peaked in late May (P15). The current regime (P17-P18) has stabilized at a lower average of 36.5 units (34 in P17, 39 in P18), which is a 40% decrease from the P13-P16 average of 61.0. This aligns with seasonal transitions in June for women's denim. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). To avoid building excess inventory during this slowdown, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the most recent cooling trend (avg ~37 units) while providing enough safety stock to handle minor fluctuations. The on-hand inventory is currently 30 units, suggesting a modest replenishment is needed to meet the expected demand of ~37 units plus safety margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: P17-P18 average demand is 36.5 units, down from the P13-P16 average of 61.0 (-40%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW jeans' has transitioned into a lower-volume period following the May rebound. Historical demand for the current period (late June) shows a cooling trend: Period 17 (34), Period 18 (39), and Period 19 (25). The 3-period average is 32.7 units, a significant decrease from the previous regime's average of 61.0. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a service level for this $4 profit/$1 holding cost item, I am using a recent_N strategy (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration. On-hand inventory is 22, and in-transit is 0, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary replenishment for Period 20 based on the current mean of ~33 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase stabilized at Period 19: 3-period average (P17-P19) is 32.7 units, down from the P13-P16 average of 61.0 (-46%) and the P9-P12 average of 40.0.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Collection) has entered a significant cooling phase following a spring peak. Observing the latest four periods (P17-P20), demand has dropped consistently: 34, 39, 25, 10. The most recent demand (10) represents a sharp drop, likely reflecting a post-seasonal lull for this specific denim SKU. Combining the last 4 periods (P17-P20), the average demand is 27.0 units. Given the transition into July (historically a period where seasonal styles shift), I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough coverage to avoid stockouts if demand recovers slightly. Sigma_hat is set to the same window to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the game history (ordered and arrived in the same period).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase intensified at Period 20: 4-period average (P17-P20) is 27.0 units, with Period 20 reaching a series low of 10. This confirms a sustained downward shift from the P13-P16 rebound average of 61.0.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 (Womens Jeans) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime. Following a May peak (avg 61.0), demand has dropped significantly. From Period 17 to Period 21, demand values have been 34, 39, 25, 10, and 9. The current 5-period average (P17-P21) is 23.4, and the last two weeks (10, 9) suggest the floor might be even lower as we move further into July. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high on-hand inventory (29 units) relative to the most recent demand (9 units), and the low profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this cooling trend while preventing excessive overstocking during the summer lull.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase stabilized: 5-period average (P17-P21) is 23.4 units, with the two most recent periods dropping below 10 units, confirming a deep seasonal low for this women's jeans item in July.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 (Womens Everyday Jeans) is currently in a deep seasonal trough during July. Historical demand has trended sharply downward from a May/June peak, with the last 6 periods showing a clear decline (48, 34, 39, 25, 10, 9, 26). The jump to 26 in Period 22 is an outlier compared to the 3-period average of ~15, potentially indicating high volatility at low levels. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower-demand regime while allowing for the slight volatility seen in the most recent period. This ensures we don't overstock during a low-demand season where holding costs ($1/unit) are significant relative to profit ($4/unit), while still maintaining enough base stock to cover current trends.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand volatility at seasonal low; Period 22 saw a jump to 26 units after three periods averaging 15 units. Overall July trend remains low compared to May/June.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 (Womens Jeans) is currently in a lower sales period compared to its May/June peak. Demand has fluctuated in July: P21 (9), P22 (26), and P23 (35). Period 23 resulted in a stockout (sold 35 units with 0 ending inventory). The current demand regime (P17-P23) shows an average demand of 25.4. However, the last two periods (26 and 35) suggest a potential upward correction or stabilization after the deep seasonal low observed in late June/early July. To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the lower seasonal baseline, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent bounce-off-the-bottom (averaging ~20 units/period) while maintaining the lead time at the promised 0. This results in a mu_hat of ~20 units per period (1+0 lead time).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization/rebound from seasonal low: Average demand for P22-P23 is 30.5 units, compared to the P19-P21 average of 14.7 units, suggesting the deep July low has passed.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 (Womens Everyday Jeans) is currently emerging from a seasonal low experienced in early-to-mid July. Demand in the most recent periods (P22-P24) has been 26, 35, and 17 units, respectively. The Carry-over Insight from Period 24 identified a stabilization/rebound phase where the P22-P23 average (30.5) was significantly higher than the preceding deep low (P19-P21 average of 14.7). However, the Period 24 demand of 17 suggests volatility rather than a linear recovery. Given we are at the end of July (2019/7/29), we expect demand to potentially begin a gradual ascent toward late-summer/back-to-school levels. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to focus on this post-trough recovery phase (P22-P24 average is 26.0), and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this transition. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 (Womens 5-pocket jeans) is entering August. Historical demand has shown volatility following a deep July low. Period 25 (July 29) saw a demand spike to 41 units, exceeding the 17 units in Period 24 and causing a stockout. This suggest a potential pre-autumn/back-to-school recovery common for 'Everyday Collection' denim in August. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P22-P25) is approximately 30 units (26, 35, 17, 41). Given the stockout in P25, true demand was likely higher. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this rebound from the July lows while providing enough safety stock (sigma_hat recent_N) to cover the observed volatility. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from July lows confirmed: Period 25 demand (41) triggered a stockout. Period 22-25 average demand is 29.8, a significant increase from the P19-P21 average of 14.7 (+100%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 (Womens Everyday Jeans) is experiencing a sharp late-summer rebound after a deep seasonal low in July. Demand in Period 26 spiked to 58 units, following a demand of 41 in Period 25 and 17 in Period 24. This shows a clear upward trend as we enter August, likely related to back-to-school or late-summer fashion shopping. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is 38.6, but the most recent two periods (41 and 58) average 49.5 and both resulted in stockouts. Given the consecutive stockouts and the strong weekly increase (+41% from P25 to P26), I will use an explicit forecast to capture this momentum and prevent further lost sales. I'll set mu_hat at 65 to account for the current trajectory, with a sigma_hat that reflects the high volatility seen during this transition phase (recent std dev is approximately 20). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from July lows accelerating in August: P25-P26 average demand is 49.5, up from the P22-P24 average of 26.0 (+90%). Consecutive stockouts occurred in P25 and P26.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245062 (women's jeans) is in an aggressive upward demand regime following its July seasonal low. Demand has surged from a P22-P24 average of 26.0 to a recent high of 91 in Period 27, resulting in three consecutive stockouts (P25-P27). The current context is mid-August, coinciding with the 'Back to School' shopping season, which typically drives significant demand for everyday apparel like skinny jeans. In Period 27, even an order of 82 units was insufficient. To stabilize inventory and capture this peak demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I forecast a mean demand of 95 units per period for the upcoming cycle to prevent further stockouts while accounting for seasonal momentum. Sigma is set to 25 to accommodate high volatility observed during these transition phases. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school seasonal surge confirmed: Demand increased from 41 (P25) to 91 (P27), a >120% rise in 3 weeks. Sustained stockouts in P25, P26, and P27 indicate current inventory levels are trailing the rapid growth of the August regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245062' (Womens Everyday Collection Jeans) is in a strong back-to-school seasonal surge. Demand has sharply risen from ~30 units in late July to an average of 89 units over the last two periods (P27: 91, P28: 87). We have observed consecutive stockouts in Periods 25, 26, and 27, though Period 28 finally concluded with an ending inventory of 30, indicating our orders are starting to catch up. The current date (Aug 26) is the peak of the back-to-school shopping season. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for high volatility during this surge, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the 41->91->87 trend, which reflects the new high-demand regime. This places the forecast at approximately (1+0) * 73 units. For sigma_hat, I will use N=5 to capture the volatility of this transition phase, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to handle potential further spikes above current levels.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school surge stabilized at a high level: Period 27-28 average demand is 89.0 units, compared to the P22-P24 average of 26.0 (+242%). Stockouts ended in P28 as inventory caught up to the regime shift.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent back-to-school demand surge (August) has stabilized. Period 29 demand was 72 units, following 87 and 91 in previous weeks. The carry-over insight notes a regime average of 89.0 units for P27-P28, while the inclusion of P29 brings the 3-period average to 83.3. As we enter September (P30), demand for skinny jeans is expected to remain high during the autumn transition but may plateaue or slightly soften compared to the peak August surge. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this high-demand regime (Avg: 83.3) for mu_hat. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility observed during the rapid climb and stabilization phases (Standard Deviation P27-P29: ~10 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: September transition: August back-to-school surge (avg 89.0) shows early signs of plateauing in P29 (72 units). Current active high-demand regime (P27-P29) average is 83.3 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item (womens everyday skinny jeans) is coming out of its late-August back-to-school peak (averaging ~89 units) and entering September. Period 29 showed a dip to 72, but Period 30 saw a rebound to 89, indicating demand remains high but potentially volatile as the season transitions. The most recent regime (P27-P30) has a mean demand of 84.75 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this current high-demand level while acknowledging the slight cooling from the absolute peak of 91. Sigma_hat is set to default (calculated over the same window by the backend) to account for the increased volatility observed in August. This ensures the base stock is high enough to avoid stockouts while starting to lean into the expected post-peak stabilization.

Carry-over insight: September demand remains high following the August surge; 4-period average (P27-P30) is 84.8 units, sustaining the back-to-school regime despite a single-week dip in P29.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans) is in a sustained high-demand regime following the August back-to-school surge. Period 31 demand reached 101 units, which is the highest since Period 1 and confirms that demand remains robust in mid-September. The 5-period average (P27-P31) is 88.0 units. A stockout occurred in Period 31 (selling 93 out of 101 demanded), leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Given the recent peak and the high service level required (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the full breadth of the current high-demand regime (Avg: 88.0). For volatility, 'recent_N' with N=5 will capture the increased variability seen during this peak period (Standard Deviation approx. 10.7), ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts while lead time remains at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-September demand remains high: Period 31 demand (101) is the series peak for the current regime (P27-P31 avg: 88.0), indicating the back-to-school surge has not yet fully receded.

The SKU 562245062 (Womens Jeans) is currently in a high-demand regime driven by the late August/September back-to-school season. Recent demand has been sustained at a high level: Period 31 (101) and Period 32 (101) match the series peak. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) is 88.5 units. Despite high ordering, the system has experienced stockouts in consecutive periods (P31, P32) due to demand exceeding the on-hand inventory. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To capture the current high-stabilized demand and prevent further stockouts, I am using the recent_N method with N=6 (covering the August/September high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~89) and the associated volatility (std ~11), ensuring the OR backend maintains a high service level during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: September high-demand regime confirmed: Demand for P31-P32 has stabilized at a series high of 101 units. Average demand for the active regime (P27-P32) is 88.5 units, compared to the July low (P19-P21 avg: 14.7).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Luna skinny RW' product has experienced a significant upward shift in Period 33, jumping to 149 units. This follows a high-demand September regime (P27-P32) which averaged 88.5 units. The surge to 149 (+68% vs previous average) suggests either a late-month peak or a transition into a new high-demand regime for October. We experienced another stockout in Period 33. Given the Lead Time is consistently 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 7 periods (P27-P33) to capture the back-to-school into autumn baseline while giving significant weight to the latest jump. The average of P27-P33 is 97.1. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*mean, and L=0, I will use recent_N with N=7 to allow the engine to react to this higher average, ensuring sufficient stock for the apparent acceleration.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand surged to 149 units, a 68% increase over the previous regime average (P27-P32: 88.5). This marks the highest demand since the series began.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a significant high-demand growth phase as we enter October (Autumn season). Demand surged to 149 in Period 33 and remained high at 131 in Period 34, despite another stockout. The last two periods average 140 units, compared to the previously recorded regime average (P27-P32) of 88.5, marking a clear regime shift (+58% increase). Following the 'recent_N' protocol for mu_hat, I will use N=3 to capture this recent acceleration (P32-P34: 101, 149, 131. Avg = 127). For sigma_hat, N=5 is used to account for the increased volatility during this surge (P30-P34). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand surged to an average of 140 units (P33-P34) from a September average of 95 units (+47%). Consecutive stockouts in P31-P34 confirm that baseline inventory targets have not yet reached the new seasonal ceiling.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 33 (late September), likely driven by seasonal demand for denim as temperatures drop in October. The average demand for the last three periods (P33-P35) is 131.7 units, compared to the September average of approximately 95 units. Although Period 35 demand (115) was lower than Period 33 (149) and Period 34 (131), it remains well above the previous baseline. The current on-hand inventory is 33 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets the new volume while accounting for the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at elevated levels for October: P33-P35 average demand is 131.7, which is a 38% increase over the P27-P32 average (95.0).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245062' (Luna skinny jeans) is currently in a sustained high-demand regime for the October period. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 36 is 131.25 units (149, 131, 115, 130). This is a significant increase from the September average of approximately 95 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized October demand level while protecting against recent volatility (standard deviation of ~14 units over the last 4 periods), I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to align with this elevated regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to provide a localized safety buffer for this high-volume period.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime stabilized at Period 33: Average demand (P33-P36) is 131.3 units, representing a 38% increase over the previous September regime (avg 95.0).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens jeans) has stabilized in a high-demand October regime. Since Period 33 (Sept 23), demand has consistently remained above the previous September average of 95, with the last five periods (P33-P37) seeing demands of 149, 131, 115, 130, and 132 respectively. The average for this 5-period regime is 131.4 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. With the game entering late October (Period 38), this high regime is likely a seasonal peak for autumn/winter everyday apparel. I am setting L to default (0) and mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 to align with the current stabilized regime of ~131 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N of 5 to reflect the current volatility of this high-volume period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the October regime (Period 33 to Period 38) has stabilized, with an average of 128.3 units per period. The most recent demand (P38: 113) shows a slight dip but remains within the established high-demand regime for this product category (jeans) heading into November. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time remains 0), I will continue to use the recent 6-period regime (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current high seasonal demand plateau while accounting for the recent variability. With on-hand inventory at 29 units and 0 in-transit, the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the required base stock for Period 39.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending November 4th (P39) was 80 units, reflecting a cooling trend from the October peak average of ~131 units. This aligns with a typical post-October/pre-holiday dip. The average demand for the last three periods (P37-P39) is 108.3 units. As we move into mid-November, we expect demand to stabilize or slightly increase as the holiday shopping season approaches. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent cooling while maintaining sufficient stock. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed from October peak: 3-period average (P37-P39) is 108.3 units, down from the P33-P36 average of 131.3 units (-17.5%).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical demand for this item (Womens 5-pocket jeans) shows a significant seasonal peak in October (avg ~131) followed by a cooling phase in November. The last four periods (P37-P40) show a downward trajectory: 132, 113, 80, 68. The most recent two periods (P39-P40) average 74 units, which is a 44% decline from the October peak. As we approach late November, demand is expected to either stabilize or potentially see a pre-holiday lift, but the current confirmed trend is downward. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling phase while maintaining service levels for potential holiday volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 (P37-P40) to reflect the recent cooling trend (avg 98.25), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility during this transition (std ~30). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase intensified in November: P39-P40 average demand is 74.0 units, a 44% decrease from the P33-P36 October regime average of 131.3 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the SKU 562245062 (womens trousers) has entered a cooling phase in November, descending from the October peak (avg 131.3). The most recent three periods (P39-P41) show demand levels of 80, 68, and 70 respectively, yielding an average of 72.7 units. This represents a significant and sustained drop (approx -45%) from the October regime. Given this stabilization at a lower level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=3 to capture this new November baseline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. With on-hand inventory at 54 units and demand around 70-75, the OR backend will likely place a moderate order to maintain the service level for the coming period while respecting the lower demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase stabilized at Period 39: 3-period average (P39-P41) is 72.7 units, a 45% decrease from the October regime average (131.3).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 (Date: 2019/11/25) surged to 327 units, which is a massive spike (+920% relative to the previous 3-period average of 72.7 units). This clearly marks the Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak for 'Womens Everyday' 5-pocket jeans. The item stocked out completely. Historically, demand tends to drop significantly immediately after this promotional peak as seen in previous transitions, but December usually maintains a holiday baseline higher than the November pre-peak cooling phase. I will set mu_hat using an explicit value that accounts for a post-spike correction while remaining elevated relative to the November lows (approx. 100 units). Sigma_hat is set high to account for the extreme volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme holiday demand spike confirmed (Black Friday); Period 42 demand reached 327 units, a tenfold increase over the November average (32.3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Black Friday week), demand spiked to 327, causing a stockout. Period 43 demand remained elevated at 133, which is significantly higher than the pre-holiday November average of ~70. Given the date (Dec 9), we are in the peak holiday shopping season. I will use 'recent_2' for mu_hat to capture the average of the Black Friday week (327) and the following week (133), which is 230. This ensures the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to meet sustained December demand. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_2' to account for the extreme volatility observed during this period. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday regime confirmed: Average demand for Period 42-43 reached 230 units, a ~215% increase over the early November average of 72.7 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (mid-December), demand fell sharply to 54 units following the massive holiday surge (avg P42-P43: 230 units). This indicates the primary peak of the 'Black Friday/Cyber Monday' period has ended. However, we are now entering the final weeks before Christmas (Dec 25). Historically, demand for everyday apparel like skinny jeans persists through the gifting season but at lower levels than the initial spike. With 292 units on hand and 0 in-transit, our current position is quite high relative to the most recent demand (54). I will set mu_hat to 80 to account for a potential moderate pre-Christmas bump while avoiding over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation in Period 47. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for the high volatility observed during the December transition. Lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked in Period 42-43 (avg 230) and corrected sharply in Period 44 (54 units), signaling the end of the extreme spike while remaining above early November levels (avg 32).

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a massive spike in Period 42 (Black Friday, 327 units) followed by a sharp correction. The holiday peak has clearly passed as Period 44-45 demand (avg 59.0) has returned toward late November levels (avg ~70). Current on-hand inventory is 228 units, which is significantly higher than the expected post-holiday demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid high holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for any late-December or Year-End clearance activity, I am setting the demand forecast to reflect the stabilization observed over the last two periods (P44-P45) while excluding the extreme outlier of the Black Friday week. Using recent_N=2 for mu_hat captures this 'return to baseline' effectively for the remaining one period of the season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-43) concluded; demand has stabilized at ~60 units (P44-45) following the peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical demand analysis shows a significant cooling phase following the extreme Black Friday/holiday spike (Period 42-43). The most recent regime (P44-P46) has stabilized at a lower level with demand values of 54, 64, and 46 units. The average for this 3-period post-peak regime is 54.7 units. The current on-hand inventory is 182 units, which is approximately 3.3x the current weekly demand average. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods (and confirmed actual lead time of 0 periods in recent data before order cessation), and the stockout-to-surplus transition after the P44 order, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the post-holiday stabilization. Sigma_hat is also set to N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility compared to the November peak. This approach allows the OR backend to reconcile the significant existing on-hand inventory against a normalized demand forecast, likely resulting in a minimal or zero order to reduce holding costs while maintaining a 54.7 unit base stock per period.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization confirmed: Period 44-46 average demand is 54.7 units, a significant reduction from the holiday peak average of 230 units.
