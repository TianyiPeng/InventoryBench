Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for an 'Essential Tanktop Lace'. The available demand samples from January to early February show a stable mean of approximately 108 units (111, 117, 92, 109, 103). As we move into mid-February, we are entering the pre-spring season for women's casual jersey items, where demand specifically for layering pieces like tank tops begins to rise or remain steady. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive in the same period to meet Period 1 demand. I will use the mean of all 5 available historical samples to set the initial demand forecast (mu_hat). With L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for one period (1+L). The standard deviation of the samples is approximately 9.3; I will use the default calculation which covers all historical data for the initial period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's casual jersey tank top with lace trims. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) averaged 108.4 units per week with a standard deviation of 9.5. In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 128 units, which is a slight uptick from the Jan/early-Feb average. We stocked 115 units and sold 115, resulting in 13 units of lost sales and 0 ending inventory. The actual lead time for Period 1 was 0 periods, matching the promised 0. Since we have very little on-hand inventory and the product is a staple item moving into the spring season, I will use a 'recent_N' approach to capture the slightly higher recent demand (128) while still considering the stable history. I'll set N=4 for mu_hat to average the last 4 observations (including Period 1) to account for potential early spring seasonality starting in February. L is set to default (0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lacy tank top, which is entering its peak seasonal period as we move into spring (late February). Historical demand samples from January/early February averaged ~108 units. However, observed demand in Period 1 (128) and Period 2 (207) shows a significant upward trend, likely driven by the transition to Spring/Summer 2019. In Period 2, we stocked out with 121 units against a demand of 207, indicating we are under-forecasting the seasonal surge. Average demand over the last two periods is ~167.5, but the jump to 207 suggests a higher target is needed. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the upward mobility, but explicitly increase mu_hat to account for the clear seasonal momentum seen in the Period 2 demand spike (207 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $621.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lacy tank top, and we are entering March, which typically sees a seasonal uptick in spring fashion items. Historical training data showed demand around 100-117 units. Recent game demand (Periods 1-3) has surged to 128, 207, and 175 (mean = 170). The current on-hand inventory is 79. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on Period 1-3 arrivals. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high demand regime (mu_hat approx (1+0)*170 = 170) and 'recent_N' for sigma to reflect the increased volatility (std of 128, 207, 175 is approx 40). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current demand spike while keeping holding costs manageable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 1: average demand increased from ~110 (pre-game) to 170 (+54%) as of Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Women's Essential Tanktop) is entering March, a period where spring seasonal demand typically starts to rise. History shows a lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in P1, P2, P3, and P4. Demand has been volatile: after a spike to 207 in P2, it settled to 175 and 121 in P3 and P4 respectively. The 'Carry-over insight' noted a shift from ~110 to ~170, but P4 came in lower at 121. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the 'in-game' demand average (avg \u2248 158) which is more representative than the pre-game samples. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 0-period lead time. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 4 periods to account for the current regime while buffering against the P2 peak.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/3/18), we are managing a women's lace tank top. Historical arrivals confirm a reliable lead time (L) of 0. Demand history shows a significant shift: after an initial spike in periods 2 and 3 (207 and 175), demand has sharply declined in periods 4 and 5 (121 and 68). The transition from winter to spring might be causing volatility in this 'Jersey Fancy' category. Given the most recent demand of 68 units and on-hand inventory of 124 units, we are currently overstocked relative to the immediate trend. To prevent further holding cost accumulation while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 (covering periods 3, 4, and 5) to capture the cooling demand more effectively than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect current variance. L remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: sharp decline from Period 3 peak (175) to Period 5 (68), suggesting a cooling period or seasonal transition.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The product is a 'Lace Essential Tanktop', which typically sees growing demand in early spring. Historical data shows a 'hump' pattern: initial demand was ~110, peaked at 207 (Period 2), and has recently cooled to 68 and 73 (Periods 5 & 6). The lead time is confirmed consistent at 0 periods across all 6 concluded cycles. Current on-hand inventory is 94 units. Given the transition into late March, demand for spring apparel often stabilizes or sees secondary peaks. To avoid over-ordering during this cooling phase while maintaining readiness for a spring rebound, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent average (~87 units/period) rather than the long-term average or the high early peaks. sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect the reduced volatility seen in the last two weeks.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a women's lacy tank top. Historical demand started strong (~170 units) but has stabilized in a lower regime over the last three periods (68, 73, 72). Average demand since Period 5 is approximately 71 units with low volatility compared to the earlier spike. Lead time consistently remains 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 40 units with nothing in-transit. I will use a N=3 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized 'cooling' regime. Lead time (L) remains 0. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 will allow the OR backend to target a base stock sufficient for the current low-demand trend without over-ordering based on the February peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed at Period 8: Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~71 units over the last 3 periods (P5-P7), significantly lower than the P1-P4 peak.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (Date: 2019/4/1), the demand spiked dramatically to 197 units, far exceeding the recent stable regime of ~71 units observed in Periods 5-7. This spike aligns with the start of April, likely representing an early spring demand surge for women's tank tops. Currently, the SKU is stock-out (ending on-hand: 0). Given the product description (Essential Tanktop Lace) and the calendar entering April, I anticipate this higher demand level will persist as weather warms. I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use a weighted recent window to capture this pivot. I will use recent_N with N=4 to include the transition from low-demand (P5-7) to high-demand (P8), which averages to approximately 102 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Demand spiked from ~70 to 197 units (+181%), signaling early spring seasonality for vest tops.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in late April (2019/04/15), a period where seasonal demand for vest tops (Essential Tanktop Lace) traditionally strengthens. The historical data shows a significant spike in Period 8 (demand=197) followed by a moderate Period 9 (demand=117). The high demand in Period 8 caused a stockout, suggesting 117 might be a 'dampened' demand figure or a return to a new mean. Given the product's seasonal nature, I expect a higher mean than the low-period (P5-P7) average of ~70. I will prioritize the most recent data (P8-P9) for the forecast. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to weigh the recent surge (mean of 197 and 117 is 157) which aligns with spring seasonality. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen since the Period 8 spike without overreacting to the single largest jump.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8 confirmed: average demand shifted from 71 (P5-P7) to ~150 (P8-P9) as spring seasonality for women's vest tops begins.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's vest top, and current demand patterns reflect spring seasonality. We are in Period 11 (late April). Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift starting at Period 8, coinciding with the shift to spring weather. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P8-P10) is approximately 150 units ((197+117+135)/3 = 149.6), which is significantly higher than the mid-March dip (P5-P7 avg = 71). Lead time analysis confirms a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Therefore, I will set L to 'default', and mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current seasonal demand level and its associated volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets the 80% service level based on the most relevant recent data.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a women's lace-trim vest top, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Looking at the history, demand spiked significantly starting Period 8 (April 1st), with demand levels reaching 197 and most recently 202. The carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift around Period 8, but the latest Period 11 demand of 202 units suggests the higher end of that range is more representative than the 150 average previously estimated. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 concluded cycles. I am currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). To capture the current seasonal surge and high volatility (ranging from 117 to 202 in the current regime), I will use the last 4 periods (P8-P11) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the high-demand spring window while lead time remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8 update: Recent demand (P8-P11) shows an average of ~163 units with high volatility (peak 202), confirming sustained spring/summer seasonal strength for vest tops.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a women's vest top (tank top), which is currently seeing its peak spring/summer seasonal demand. Period 12 (April 29) showed a demand of 111 units, which is lower than the previous period's 202, but historical demand from P8-P12 averages roughly 152.4 units. We are firmly in a high-demand regime compared to the early March lull. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given the high volatility in the current regime (111 to 202 units), I will use a recent_N approach over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) to capture the current seasonal mean and variance while filtering out the pre-season data. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher sales rate (mu_hat) and the increased unpredictability (sigma_hat) associated with the seasonal climb.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Women's Essential Tanktop) has entered May (Period 14). Historically, we saw a demand surge in April (P8-P11 average ~163), but demand has dropped significantly over the last two periods: Period 12 (111) and Period 13 (40). This sharp decline suggests either high volatility or a temporary dip after the initial spring spike. The current on-hand inventory is 150 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand (40). Given the lead time is consistently 0, we can afford to be reactive. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the spring regime (balancing the high April demand with the lower May starts), while retaining 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the overall high volatility seen through the season. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in early May: after an April average of ~163, demand dropped to 111 (P12) and 40 (P13), suggesting a potential transition or high variance in late spring/early summer demand for vest tops.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a Women's Lace Vest Top, which typically sees high demand in summer but can be volatile in late spring due to weather shifts. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Recent demand (P12-P14) shows a significant cooling trend: 111, 40, and 49 units respectively, marking a sharp drop from the April average of ~163 units. This confirms the 'demand volatility' noted in previous carry-over insights. With an on-hand inventory of 125 units, which covers over 2.5 periods of the most recent demand (avg ~50), I need to lower my order target. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime (avg ~66, std ~38). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock downward, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a buffer for potential late-May spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~163 (P8-P12) to ~45 (P13-P14), a -72% drop, indicating a temporary cooling or end of the early spring surge.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Casual Fitted Vest Top', highly sensitive to seasonal weather and calendar events. Period 15 showed a significant demand surge to 189 units, likely driven by the lead-up to the UK Summer Bank Holiday and a shift into warmer late May weather. This contradicts the previous cooling trend noted in Carry-over insights, suggesting that Period 13 and 14 (average ~45) were a temporary dip rather than a seasonal end. Given the current date (May 27), we are entering peak summer sales months (June/July). Lead time is consistently 0 (all orders P1-P14 arrived in the same period). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit following the stockout in P15, a robust order is needed to meet the renewed high demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent volatility (40, 49, 189), which results in a mean of ~92.6, but I'll set sigma_hat to 'explicit' to account for the high variance observed in this transition (from 40 to 189). This ensures the base_stock calculation covers the likely continuation of high summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: The cooling period (P13-P14 avg 45) ended abruptly with a spike to 189 units (+320%), confirming sustained but volatile summer seasonality for vest tops.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Women's Vest Top) is experiencing significant summer seasonality as of June 3rd (Period 17). Historical demand for the last two periods was 189 and 240, indicating a high-demand regime. The carry-over insights confirm this SKU is highly volatile, with demand often exceeding 200 units during spring/summer peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent arrival confirmation in the same period as ordered. Given the stockout in Period 16 (sold only 165 out of 240 demand), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture the current high-demand peak (avg ~214). I will use explicit sigma_hat set to approximately 30% of mu_hat to handle the high volatility typically seen in this item during demand spikes, ensuring a higher service level during this peak summer season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: June summer peak has begun with demand increasing from ~45 (P13-P14) to an average of 214.5 (P15-P16), a 375% increase.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Women's Vest Top) is in its summer seasonal peak. While Period 17 saw a demand dip to 116 units, the preceding weeks (P15-P16) showed very high demand (189, 240). June is historically a high-demand month for this category. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the current summer regime (averaging ~181 units/period). Given the high volatility observed in P17 (116 vs the previous 240), I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 to ensure the safety stock accounts for this high variance. This approach balances the need to maintain stock for the summer peak while acknowledging the recent week's fluctuation.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The SKU is a women's lace vest top, which is in its peak seasonal window. Historical data shows high volatility: a massive surge to 189 and 240 units in Periods 15 and 16, followed by a cooling to 116 and 94 units in the most recent two periods (P17-P18). Although demand dipped recently, we are in mid-June, and the carry-over insights correctly identified a regime shift starting at Period 15 (moving from a low-demand May period back into summer strength). Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the current summer regime while accounting for the recent cooling within that regime, I will use a recent_N of 4 periods (P15-P18) for mu_hat. This averages (189+240+116+94)/4 = 159.75 units per period. This balances the extreme peaks of late May with the moderate demand of early June, providing protection against further summer spikes while avoiding excessive stock if the recent cooling persists.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/06/24) continues the summer season for this 'Essential Tanktop'. Historically, demand is highly volatile. After the massive spike in Periods 15/16 (avg 214 units), demand cooled over Periods 17-19 to an average of 112 units (116, 94, 127). The item description ('Womens Casual / Jersey Fancy') and the date suggest we are in peak summer. The recent 3-period drop might be a temporary consolidation before late-summer heatwaves or sales, but it provides a more sustainable baseline than the 240-unit spike. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a 3-period window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this recent stabilization at ~112 units per period, while setting sigma_hat to reflect the significant volatility seen across the broader summer regime (N=7 covers from P13 to P19) to ensure we have safety stock against another potential 200+ unit spike. Current on-hand is 90.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Summer peak volatility moderated, with average demand stabilizing at ~112 units (P17-P19) after the P15-P16 spike (avg 214).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (late June), demand for the woman's vest top spiked massively to 434 units, far exceeding the previous stabilization at ~112 units. This indicates a high-summer demand peak, likely driven by hot weather or July sales events. With on-hand inventory at 0 and lead time reliably at 0 periods, I must aggressively increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this peak and avoid lost sales (stockouts occurred in P20). I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the P20 observation and recent volatility, setting a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme unpredictability shown in the P20 surge versus the P17-P19 average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Extreme summer peak observed with demand hitting 434 units, a 287% increase over the P17-P19 average (~112), indicating highly volatile peak-season behavior for the vest top.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 (July 8, 2019), peak summer for this 'Womens Casual Fitted vest top'. Historical demand in this period is extremely volatile: P20 saw a massive spike to 434 units, followed by P21 at 124 units. Total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 353 units. Given the high summer seasonality and the previous extreme spike, the goal is to maintain a buffer for another potential late-July peak while acknowledging the current excess inventory (353 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the high-regime summer average (~178 units) and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent extreme variance. This should result in a base stock that covers the volatile summer demand without over-ordering excessively since our currently on-hand stock is relatively high.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Women's Vest Top) is currently in its peak summer season (July), which has been characterized by extreme volatility and intermittent spikes (e.g., 434 units in Period 20, followed by 124 and 81). The recent 3-period demand average (P20-P22) is approximately 213 units, but the last two periods have shown a significant cooling (avg 102.5). Given the current high on-hand inventory of 272 units and the lead time of 0, there is No immediate risk of stockout if demand stays near the recent moderate level, but the OR backend needs parameters that account for the high summer variance to protect against potential late-July spikes. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent summer volume while using a longer N=6 for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the extreme volatility observed since late June (P17-P22). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak seasonality (P17-P22) characterized by extreme mean-shift volatility: mean ~180, but with a range of 81 to 434 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019/7/22), the product is in the heart of the summer season. Historical demand for this vest top has shown extreme volatility over the last 7 periods (P17-P23), with demand values ranging from 81 to 434 and an average of 163 units. The most recent demand (P23) was 167 units, very close to this recent seasonal average. The critical challenge is the high variance (std dev ~120), which requires a robust base stock to avoid lost sales, especially since lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 159, and the average demand is 163, we need to ensure the order covers potential spikes. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current summer regime, and sigma_hat also using recent_N (N=7) to account for the high volatility observed in this period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Women's Essential Tanktop) is currently in a high-demand summer phase (late July). Historical lead time calculation shows consistently 0 periods. The recent demand regime (P23-P24) has stabilized around an average of 168 units (167 and 169 respectively), which is a significant departure from the extreme 434-unit peak in P20 and the 81-unit trough in P22. To capture this stabilization while acknowledging the inherent high volatility of summer 'Vest tops', I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4. This covers the period from P21 to P24 (demand: 124, 81, 167, 169), providing a balanced mean (~135) and a variance that reflects recent fluctuations. L=0 remains consistent with history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized late July: Average demand for P23-P24 is ~168 units, indicating a moderation from the extreme summer peak volatility seen in June/early July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019-08-05). Historical demand for this 'Essential Tanktop' shows extreme volatility during the summer, with a massive peak in late June/early July (up to 434 units) followed by a stabilization in late July (P23-P25 average ~138 units). Most recently, Period 25 demand dropped to 77, which may indicate the beginning of the end-of-summer decline. Lead time consistently remains 0. I will prioritize the last 3 periods (P23-P25) to set the demand mean (mu_hat), as they represent the post-peak summer stabilization. Given the recent drop to 77 and the high historical variance of this SKU, I will use a slightly longer window (N=5) for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the significant potential for spikes even as the season cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating in August: After the extreme summer peak in June/July (up to 434 units), demand for P23-P25 has normalized to an average of ~138 units, with P25 showing a further drop to 77 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's vest top (Essential Tanktop Lace TVP). We are currently in mid-August (Period 27). Historical data and carry-over insights indicate that we are past the extreme summer peak (June/July) and are observing a significant moderation in demand as we approach the late summer/early autumn transition. Specifically, demand in the last two periods was 77 (P25) and 60 (P26), continuing a downward trend from the July average (~168). The current mean over the last 4 periods (P23-P26) is approximately 118, but the most recent 2 periods average only 68.5. Given the product category, demand is expected to continue cooling in late August. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this moderating trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at default (0) as lead times have consistently been 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: August cooling confirmed with demand dropping to an average of 68.5 units (P25-P26), down from the P23-P24 average of 168.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for the 'ESSENTIAL TANKTOP LACE TVP' (a summer vest top) is showing a clear seasonal decline as we move into late August. Demand over the last three periods (P25-P27) has been 77, 60, and 39 units respectively, confirming a downward trend from the July average of ~168. The mean of these last three samples is approximately 58.7. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. Given the high on-hand inventory (128 units) relative to the declining demand, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this cooling regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current volatility while avoiding the extreme noise of the mid-summer peak. These parameters will likely result in a low or zero order this period, which is appropriate given the seasonal transition and existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: End-of-summer cooling for vest tops evidenced by demand dropping from 168 (P23-P24 avg) to 58.7 (P25-P27 avg), a 65% decrease.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lace-trimmed vest top, which is highly seasonal. We are now in late August (Period 29: 2019/08/26). History shows a clear end-of-summer cooling trend. Demand has dropped significantly over the last four periods (P25-P28: 77, 60, 39, 49), averaging approximately 56 units. This is a sharp contrast to the June/July peak which saw demand as high as 434 and averages around 180. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the cooling trend and the shift towards autumn, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime and avoid overstocking. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same range to reflect current volatility. With on-hand inventory at 79 and an expected demand around 56, the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order, which is appropriate for a declining seasonal product.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (2019/09/02), the product enters the early autumn phase. Historical data shows that demand for this 'essential tanktop' has significantly cooled from its summer peaks (which reached up to 434 units). In the most recent four periods (P26-P29), demand has been 60, 39, 49, and 114, averaging approximately 65.5 units. The spike to 114 in P29 suggests some lingering or volatile late-season interest, but the overall trend since late July (Period 25) is a shift to a lower-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking during this cooling period while accounting for the recent P29 spike, I will use a recent_N window (N=5, including the P25-P29 data) to capture the current mean of ~68 units and its associated volatility. This approach balances the need to satisfy potential late-summer demand spikes without accumulating high holding costs as we transition into September.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: Frequent late-summer volatility observed with a surprise spike to 114 units after a three-period low-demand stretch (avg ~49), though the broader trend remains in a cooling phase compared to the June/July peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the late-summer cooling phase for this women's vest top. Historically, demand for vest tops drops significantly as the season transitions into autumn. Recent demand (P28-P30) shows an average of 91 units (49, 114, 110), but this includes a surprise late-summer spike. Looking at the broader trend since P25, demand has consistently been lower than the summer peak, averaging around 70 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6, covering P25-P30) to capture this downward seasonal trend while acknowledging the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set using the same period to reflect the moderate variance seen in late August/early September. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all concluded orders in history.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand (Sept) for vest tops stabilized at a lower mean of ~77 units (avg P25-P30) despite short-term volatility spikes, confirming seasonal cooling.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Women's Vest Top) is in a late-summer/early-autumn phase (Sept 16). After the extreme summer volatility (June/July peaks of 434), demand settled into a lower regime in August (averaging ~60). However, the most recent three periods (P29-P31) show a stabilization and slight upward shift in demand, averaging 115.6 units (114, 110, 123). This suggests that while 'cooling' has occurred relative to peak summer, the baseline demand for this 'essential' item remains stronger than the early August lows. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to demand exceeding the ordered quantities in P30 and P31. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this stabilized 'new normal' demand of ~115 units, rather than the lower August average or the volatile July peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: Post-summer demand stabilized at a higher baseline than August lows, with an average of ~115 units over P29-P31 (up from ~60 in P25-P28).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. The product is a women's vest top, which is typically seasonal. After the extreme volatility of the summer peak (June/July), demand cooled in August. However, since Period 29 (late August/early September), demand has stabilized at a higher baseline than the August lows. Specifically, over the last four periods (P29-P32), demand was [114, 110, 123, 75], yielding an average of 105.5 units. The Period 32 demand of 75 units suggests the volatility continues, but the 'recent_N' method with N=4 will capture this post-summer stabilization while accounting for the lower volume compared to the summer peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 47 units, and no shipments are in transit, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size based on the new mean (~106) and current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime shift confirmed at Period 29: demand has stabilized at an average of ~106 units (P29-P32), which is higher than the August cooling phase (~60 units) but significantly lower than the June/July peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The product is a women's fitted vest top with lace trims (572797001). Historical data indicates we are in a post-summer demand regime. Demand since Period 29 (late August/September) has stabilized at a moderate average of approximately 98 units (P29-P33 readings: 114, 110, 123, 75, 67), which is lower than the June/July peak but higher than the August cooling phase. The most recent two periods (P32-P33) show a slight downward trend (75 and 67 units), suggesting the transition into autumn may be beginning. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage late-season volatility while avoiding excess inventory as temperatures drop, I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this post-summer stabilization (Avg: 97.8 units). I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the current moderated volatility compared to the extreme summer peaks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019 (Period 35). We are managing a women's vest top, a category heavily influenced by seasonality. Reviewing historical data, demand for this SKU peaked in June/July (up to 434 units) and has since entered a significant cooling phase as we move into autumn. Over the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has been 123, 75, 67, and 48 units respectively, showing a clear downward trend towards late-year stabilization. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P29-P34) is approximately 81 units, but the last two weeks suggest a further decline to ~57 units as seasonal utility for vest tops wanes in October. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. To avoid overstocking during this seasonal decline while maintaining a 0.8 service level (based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use recent_N to capture the cooling trend. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to weight the recent low-demand signals (average ~78) and N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the moderate volatility seen during this post-summer transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Late-autumn cooling confirmed as demand dropped from an average of ~106 (P29-P32) to ~57 units (P33-P34), reflecting reduced seasonal relevance for vest tops in October.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (fitted vest top) is currently in a late-autumn cooling phase (October), though Period 35 showed a unexpected spike to 118 units. History shows high volatility for this product, especially around seasonal transitions. The carry-over insights confirm a shift starting at Period 33, where demand dropped from a ~106 average to ~57. Despite the P35 spike, the broader trend is downward. I will use recent history (N=3, Periods 33-35) to capture this lower seasonal baseline while acknowledging the recent spike in the volatility estimate. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. On-hand and in-transit are currently 0, necessitating a fresh order based on the new mean and variance.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jersey Fancy' fitted vest top with lace trims. We are currently in late October (2019/10/21). Analysis of recent periods shows a surprise secondary peak: demand for P35 and P36 was 118 and 152 respectively, significantly higher than the early October cooling phase (P33-P34 avg of ~57). This suggests late autumn volatility or potentially a promotional event for this jersey item. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on history. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use recent_N=4 (P33-P36) to capture this recent spike while acknowledging the volatile trend, resulting in an average of 96.25 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased standard deviation (approx 47) from these fluctuations, ensuring the backend maintains enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: Late October observed a secondary demand spike (avg 135 for P35-P36) contrasting with the early October cooling (avg 57 for P33-P34).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Women's Vest Top) is currently in a late-autumn phase (late October). Historically, demand for vest tops cooling down as we move into November is expected; however, a secondary spike was observed in Periods 35-37 (avg 127 units), which is higher than the early October cooling phase (avg 57). The current Period 38 setup shows 25 units on hand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To balance the risk of staying out of stock during this volatile secondary peak while acknowledging the general seasonal cooling trend, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P35-P37) where the secondary spike occurred (mean = 127.3). This ensures we capture the immediate demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to account for recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a late-autumn phase for this product (Essential Tanktop Lace). After a secondary spike in late October (periods 35-36, average ~135), demand has begun to moderate again with Period 37-38 averaging 102.5 units. The Carry-over insights suggest that since Period 33, demand has been volatile, oscillating between cooling phases (~57) and spikes (~135). The most recent regime (P35-P38) shows an average demand of 118.75. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To handle the continued volatility while acknowledging the likely late-season decline, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current post-October-spike level, and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed over the last month including the spike peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 confirmed: Late October spike averaged ~119 units (P35-P38), significantly higher than the early October low of 57 units, indicating unseasonal late-year volatility for vest tops.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand for the Essential Tanktop continues to exhibit unseasonal late-year strength, averaging approximately 117 units over the last five periods (P35-P39). This is a significant departure from the early October cooling phase where demand averaged 57 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this recent volatility and ensure adequate stock for the current period's demand, I am using a recent_N window of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime rather than the long-term annual average. This approach cushions against the 'unseasonal volatility' noted in the carry-over insights while maintaining a service level reflective of the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (fitted vest top) is currently in Period 41 (mid-November). Despite the seasonal nature of vest tops, demand has remained surprisingly resilient and volatile throughout October and early November. The 'Late October spike' documented in carry-over insights has extended into November, with the last six periods (P35-P40) averaging ~121.5 units, compared to the early October low of ~57. Specifically, Period 40 saw a demand of 145, which resulted in a stockout (sold 136, 0 ending inventory). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this sustained late-season volatility and prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the November date, I will use a recent_N method with N=6 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the current regime that began around P35. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~120 unit demand level rather than the lower annual average or the extreme summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 confirmed: Late-year demand (Oct-Nov) has stabilized at a higher-than-expected average of ~122 units (P35-P40), significantly exceeding the early October cooling phase (~57 units).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Reviewing the historical data, the promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Demand for this vest top has been surprisingly resilient in late autumn. Since the regime shift at Period 35, the average demand has been approximately 122 units (Periods 35-41: 118, 152, 112, 93, 109, 145, 95). While there is some fluctuation, there is no evidence of the expected winter drop-off yet. I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 samples (recent_N=7) to capture this stable late-year baseline of ~118 units per period (weighted for L=0). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to account for the current volatility levels. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the sustained demand while avoiding excessive holding costs if a seasonal drop occurs in December.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Essential Tanktop Lace TVP spiked significantly in Period 42 to 328 units, coinciding with the start of late November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week). This follows a period of stabilization around 120 units. Given this is a 'vest top', while typically a summer item, the 'lace trim' and 'casual' description may drive holiday-related demand (layering or gifting). The spike is extreme (similar to the June peak of 434), suggesting a temporary but intense seasonal surge. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will adjust mu_hat to capture this surge using a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (covering the late October/November regime) but I must also account for the volatility seen in the most recent sample. Although the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 as well. I will set parameters to ensure high service level given the potential for continued holiday shopping volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Significant spike to 328 units observed (Date: 2019/11/25), likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotional period, reflecting high late-year volatility for this SKU.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797001 (Essential Tanktop Lace) is currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). In the previous period (P43, Dec 2), we saw a major demand drop to 89 units following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike of 328 units (P42). Historical data from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 shows demand ranging from 92 to 117 (average ~106). Given the post-promotional cooling and historical early-year levels, I expect demand to settle around a mean of 110-120 units heading into the Christmas/New Year period. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current on-hand inventory of 121 and ensure availability for potential holiday volatility without excessive holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for demand and sigma. For mu_hat, N=6 (covering P38-P43) captures the high-volatility window including the spike and the subsequent correction, averaging ~144 units per period. This provides a safe buffer for the 1-period risk horizon (L+1). For sigma_hat, N=6 captures the intense variance seen during the late-year shift.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand correction observed at Period 43: demand dropped from 328 to 89 (-73%) units, returning to historical baseline levels (~100-110).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the post-Black Friday period (P44 demand: 105) and approaching mid-December. Holiday demand for a 'Jersey Fancy' vest top often shows a secondary peak for winter festivities or gifting, but typically starts to stabilize or drop as the year ends. Historically, this SKU has stabilized at a baseline of approximately 100-110 units (P43-P44) after the extreme P42 spike (328 units). The on-hand inventory is 117 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the transition from the Black Friday surge back to baseline, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization (avg ~174/period, though skewed by the 328 spike) and sigma_hat (recent_N=5) to account for the high volatility seen in November. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 integrates the return to normalcy more effectively than the long-term average while still respecting the P42 volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which is right before Christmas and following the Black Friday spike (P42, 328 units). Demand has since stabilized into a consistent post-promotion baseline: P43-P45 demand values are 89, 105, and 119, respectively (avg ~104). While the product is a vest top, which typically cools in winter, current demand levels are surprisingly resilient. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this steady post-promotion baseline (avg ~104) while accounting for potential volatility using recent_N=10 for sigma (to include the Black Friday spike and subsequent variance). The lead time remains consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 140, so the OR backend will compute an order that maintains this base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43-P45) has settled at a stable baseline of ~104 units, showing higher late-December resilience than the earlier October/November averages.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, following the Christmas period and heading into the new year. Demand for this SKU (Essential Tanktop Lace TVP) has stabilized post-Black Friday at a baseline of approximately 104 units (averaging P44: 105, P45: 119, P46: 105). While the Black Friday peak (P42: 328 units) was a significant outlier, the subsequent three periods show consistent, stable demand. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages (P46, P45, P44). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the objective is to maintain a high service level while preventing excessive ending inventory. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the stable post-peak demand baseline (~110 units) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the volatility context leading up to and including the current stabilization, without being overly influenced by the single extreme Black Friday outlier.
