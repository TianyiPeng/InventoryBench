Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Angela hipster' underwear. Promised lead time is 0. Historical demand shows 5 samples: 59, 14, 28, 85, 85 (Mean: 54.2, Std: 32.5). There is no obvious seasonality or trend yet in this short history, though the last two weeks (85 units) show a significant jump compared to the middle weeks. Since OH and In-Transit are zero, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture all available history while remaining sensitive to the recent uptick in demand. Given L=0, the backend will target (1+0) = 1 period of demand. The high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) means the target service level is high (~95%), which the OR backend will naturally handle with these parameters.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Angela hipster' underwear. Promised lead time is 0, and Period 1's order arrived immediately (lead_time=0), confirming it as same-period arrival. Demand for Period 1 was 91 units. Historical samples show demand ranging from 14 to 85, but the most recent 3 weeks (Jan 28, Feb 4, and last week Feb 11) have shown significantly higher and steadier demand (85, 85, 91). We should treat these recent observations as the current demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this shift and ensure enough stock to cover the current period's demand (which occurs after the decision).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand data provided (Jan-early Feb) shows a mean of 54.2. However, recent demand in simulation (P1-P2) has spiked significantly to 91 and 110. This SKU is cotton hipster underwear, often a stable staple, but the recent periods show a clear regime shift higher than the initial history. In P2, we stocked out (ending inventory 0, sold 93 out of 110 demand), losing 17 units of potential profit. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). For P3, I will prioritize recent demand samples (N=2 from simulation history + last few samples from provided data) to reflect this higher volume. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the ~50s to ~100 range, ensuring the base stock covers the higher demand and prevents another stockout. Promised lead time is 0, and observed lead time is 0, so L=default (0) is appropriate.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). Historical demand samples for SKU 603145001 are: 59, 14, 28, 85, 85 (pre-game) and 91, 110, 111 (game periods). There is a clear shift in demand starting from late January/February where demand stabilized at a higher level (~100 units/period) compared to the early January samples. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the last 3 game cycles. The stock-out in Period 2 (sold 93 vs demand 110) indicates the previous parameters were slightly conservative. I will use the last 5 samples (capturing the recent higher demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=5 covers P-1 through P3 and the last pre-game sample (85), resulting in a mean of approximately 96.4 units. With L=0, the OR backend will target (1+0) * mean demand. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for the current period's demand while accounting for the recent increase in volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: demand increased from an average of ~46 to ~100 units per week. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand samples (Pre-Feb) showed a mean of ~54, but since February (Period 1-4), demand has shifted significantly to a higher regime: 91, 110, 111, and 63 units (average ~94). The Period 4 demand of 63 is a slight dip but still within the higher variance of the new regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. On-hand inventory is 55 units. To ensure high service levels (given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio suggests a ~95% service level) while acknowledging the recent shift, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean since the regime change in February.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1709.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is Angela hipster underwear. Based on the demand history starting from February (Period 1 to Period 5), there is a clear regime shift compared to the initial samples (Jan 2019). The average demand over the last 5 periods is 93.4 units (91, 110, 111, 63, 92), confirming the carry-over insight of ~100 units/week. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will continue to assume. Currently, we have 39 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To ensure we cover the current period's demand (which occurs after the decision), I'll set parameters based on the recent 5-period regime (N=5) to capture the higher mean and volatility of this period correctly. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1), justifying a high service level.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. The demand for the Angela hipster (Underwear) shifted in early February and has remained stable through March. Demand for the last 6 periods (Period 1 to Period 6) has been: 91, 110, 111, 63, 92, 109, with an average of 96 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm an actual lead time of 0 consistently (observed in periods 1 through 6). There are currently 17 units on hand and 0 in transit. I will use the recent 6 periods to calculate the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the much lower January pre-shift data. Using L=0 reflects the consistently observed immediate delivery.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical data and game history indicate a sustained demand regime shift that began in early February. Since Period 1, weekly demand has averaged approximately 100 units (91, 110, 111, 63, 92, 109, 122), which is significantly higher than the pre-February average of ~54. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). The current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), while the target base stock needs to cover the current period's demand (approx 100). To capture the most relevant demand behavior since the regime shift, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7, covering the periods since the shift was confirmed. Setting L to 'calculate' effectively uses the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 is a basic underwear item (hipster briefs) showing a sustained demand regime shift. Since Period 1 (early Feb 2019), weekly demand has averaged approximately 106 units (91, 110, 111, 63, 92, 109, 122, 149). In Period 8, we experienced a stockout because the starting on-hand inventory (132) was lower than the actual demand (149). This indicates that the demand is trending upwards or experiencing higher volatility as we move into April. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the average demand since the February shift (~106 units), and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to account for the recent volatility seen in March and early April. Given L=0, base stock is calculated for 1 period of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in April: demand spiked to 149 in Period 8, significantly above the regime average of 106.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a basic underwear item (Angela hipster). In Period 9, demand dropped to 87 units from a peak of 149 in Period 8, suggesting that the previous volatility was a spike rather than a sustained shift. The mean demand over the last 9 periods (the recent regime identified in Period 4) is approximately 104 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods across all observations. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime which averages ~104 per period. Since L=0 and demand occurs after the order arrival, we need to cover 1 period of demand (1+L). I will use default for sigma_hat to maintain a buffer for the recent volatility observed in April.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019. The product (Angela hipster underwear) has settled into a higher demand regime since February, but the most recent two weeks (Periods 9 and 10) have shown a significant deceleration in demand (87 and 65 units) compared to the peak in Period 8 (149). This suggests the volatility noted in Period 9 has resolved into a cooling phase OR a stabilization near the mid-regime average of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking given the current on-hand inventory of 99 and the slowing demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (Periods 7-10) to capture both the peak and the subsequent drop, yielding an average of approximately 106. This provides a buffer if demand rebounds while reacting to the lower recent numbers. sigma_hat will also use a 4-period window to capture the recent high variance.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is 'Angela hipster' (underwear), which shows steady demand with some volatility. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The demand regime shifted in February to an average of ~100 per week. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows an average of 104.8 (149, 87, 65, 116, and the previous 109 roughly matching). However, April has shown higher volatility (Period 8 had 149, while Period 10 had 65). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most current demand level and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for this increased April volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to handle spikes without excessive holding costs. L is maintained at default (0).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in a high-demand regime that began in February 2019. Over the last 12 periods, demand has averaged 102.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. The most recent three periods (P10-P12) show demand of 65, 116, and 119. While P10 was a dip, P11 and P12 have rebounded to the regime average. The product is a staple underwear item ('Angela hipster'), which typically shows consistent demand but can be subject to baseline shifts. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. To handle the observed volatility (standard deviation ~21) and the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (target service level ~95%), I will use recent_N to capture the current demand regime. I will set N=12 to cover the entire stable regime since February, providing a robust mean and variance estimate while filtering out the noise of the P8 spike and P10 dip.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a demand regime change starting from February 2019 (Period 1). Over the last 13 periods, the mean weekly demand has been 103.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23 units. Analyzing the most recent 5 periods (Periods 9-13), the average demand is 101.2 units, which is consistent with the post-regime-shift average. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. We are currently in mid-May (Period 14). There is no strong evidence of a further regime shift, although demand remains slightly volatile. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stable post-shift demand mean and variance while smoothing out the minor fluctuations observed in April. This aligns with the 'base stock' logic where the OR engine will target a stock level sufficient to cover current demand plus a safety margin given the relatively high profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton jersey hipster briefs) is experiencing high demand volatility. The current date is May 20th. Period 14 (May 13th) showed a significant demand surge to 171 units, which resulted in a stockout (sold 149, ending inventory 0). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Since February (Period 1), demand has shifted from the initial historical mean of ~46 to a higher mean. Analyzing the last 6 periods (Periods 9-14), the average demand is approximately 109 units (87, 65, 116, 119, 119, 171). However, the recent spike to 171 suggests that the 9-period 'high regime' average (~106-110) may be moving higher or becoming much more volatile as we enter summer. Given the stockout in Period 14 and the critical need to capture the current high demand while minimizing stockouts (profit of $19 vs holding of $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent trend while weighting the forecast toward the higher end of recent observations through sigma. I will keep L at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge in May: Period 14 saw a peak of 171 units, leading to a stockout. Recent 6-period demand average is ~109 but shows high volatility (variance).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2568.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 is currently in Period 16 (late May). Analysis of the demand history reveals a high-demand regime established since Period 1, with the most recent 10-period average (Periods 6-15) being approximately 119.7 units. However, demand is highly volatile, with a significant peak of 171 in Period 14 followed by 137 in Period 15, likely influenced by seasonal shifts in late spring. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 0 periods throughout the entire history. To protect against recent volatility and the risk of stockouts seen in Period 14, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-demand level, and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 (Periods 11-15) to specifically weight the recent increase in volatility. This will increase the safety stock buffer while maintaining responsiveness to the zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in late May; the most recent 5-period average (Periods 11-15) risen to ~132 units compared to the previous 10-period average of ~112, suggesting a potential further upward drift in demand volume.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early June (2019-06-03). Historical lead time has been consistently 0 periods. The SKU is a 'hipsters briefs' underwear product, which generally sees steady demand but can experience seasonal lifts during the transition to warmer weather. Analyzing the recent history (Periods 11-16), demand has averaged 137 units per week, which is significantly higher than the earlier regime average. The last period (Period 16) saw a demand of 160 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 158 units with 0 ending inventory). This confirms a sustained upward shift in demand and high volatility. To ensure we capture this new level and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6), which covers the high-demand window starting in late April. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock level appropriate for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late May/early June: the average demand for Periods 11-16 is 137 units, compared to the previous regime's 112 units (~22% increase). Volatility remains high with demand consistently exceeding 130 units in 4 of the last 6 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this SKU (hipster briefs) has stabilized in a higher regime over the last 7 periods (Periods 11-17), with an average demand of 135.85 units (116, 119, 119, 171, 137, 160, 129). This is a significant increase from the previous average of ~112. The product shows high volatility, especially in May, where demand peaked at 171 and 160, causing stockouts when inventory was insufficient. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To handle the increased volume and volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7) to capture this 'late spring/early summer' demand regime while maintaining a high service level through the OR backend's critical ratio (~0.95).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton hipster underwear) is currently in a high-demand regime characterized by both elevated volume and significant volatility. Analyzing recent performance (Periods 11-18), the average demand is 133.5 units, which is a notable increase from earlier months. The most recent demand (Period 18) was 117, slightly lower than the recent peak but still within the high-demand band. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 19, I will use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime established since mid-April/May (Periods 11-18), as this period reflects the current market behavior better than the full history. This setting provides a base stock high enough to service demand spikes above 160 (as seen in Periods 14 and 16) while the OR backend's service level logic (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will naturally protect against stockouts in this volatile environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1851.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'Angela hipster' underwear shows a stable but high-volume regime since late May. Over the last 6 periods (Periods 14-19), demand has averaged 136.1 units. While Period 19 showed a slight dip to 101 units, the overall trend since Period 14 (171, 137, 160, 129, 117, 101) averages significantly higher than the earlier regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to reflect this elevated demand pattern and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the recent high volatility. This allows for an appropriate buffer against stockouts during this sustained high-demand phase.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/01. Analyzing recent demand history, there was a significant peak in May/early June (Periods 14-17), where demand consistently stayed above 130 units. However, the last three periods (18, 19, 20) have shown a steady decline in demand: 117, 101, and most recently 60 units. This suggests the high-demand regime identified in late May has likely peaked and is now reverting or shifting downwards as we move into July. The 'Angela hipster' (cotton underwear) often sees peak demand in late spring/early summer, and July may see a stabilization or slight dip. Since on-hand inventory is currently high at 125 units (due to the low demand of 60 in Period 20), I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent 5 periods (Periods 11-20 average is too biased by the peak), using N=7 to balance the recent high-volatility peak with the current downward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward observed in July: Demand decreased from a late-May peak average of ~137 to a 3-period average (P18-P20) of 92.6 units, reflecting a potential post-peak seasonal cooling.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for 'Angela hipster' underwear has shown a consistent downward trend over the last month, dropping from late-May peaks of ~160 to recent demands of 60 (P20) and 57 (P21). This confirms the 'cooling' regime shift noted in the previous carry-over insight. The 4-period demand average (P18-P21) is approximately 84 units, significantly lower than the May/June average of 137. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 130, and a current demand regime averaging ~84, the system is currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent lower-demand regime (N=4) to prevent excessive ordering until inventory levels normalize. Sigma_hat will also use recent history to capture the current volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained downward demand regime confirmed through July: 4-period average (P18-P21) is 83.75 units, a ~39% decrease from the May/June peak average of 137.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' (cotton jersey briefs) continues to show a sustained downward cooling in July. The most recent demand samples are 77, 57, 60, and 101 (averaging 73.75), which is significantly lower than the May/June peak average of ~137. This suggests a post-peak seasonal shift for this basic underwear SKU. I am using a N=4 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime shift while maintaining enough history to account for some variance. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. The current on-hand inventory of 56 units is substantial given the lower demand, so the OR backend will likely generate a small or zero order to minimize holding costs while the target inventory level recalibrates to the lower mean.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Historical data and recent observations confirm a sustained downward demand regime following a seasonal peak in May/June. Specifically, the last six periods (P18-P23) show demand values of 117, 101, 60, 57, 77, and 43. This averages to approximately 75.8 units per week, which is a significant drop from the May peak average of 137. The most recent three periods (P21-P23) average even lower at 59 units, suggesting the cooling trend is ongoing. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this high-margin item (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this lower regime while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed through late July: 6-period average (P18-P23) is 75.8 units, down ~45% from the May peak. Most recent 3-period average is 59 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 603145001 has entered a sustained lower regime following the May/June peak. Demand for the last 7 periods (P18-P24) averages 77.0 units, with the most recent 4 periods (P21-P24) averaging 64.75 units. The Period 24 demand of 82 was a slight uptick but remains well below the summer peak. We are currently in late July (2019-07-29). I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this cooler demand state while maintaining protection against the volatility seen in the last period. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. Historical demand data shows a clear seasonal peak in May/June (~137/week) followed by a cooling period through July. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P19-P25) is approximately 76.4 units, but the most recent 4 periods (P22-P25) average 69.25 units. This suggests demand is stabilizing at a lower level for August. No shipments have been lost, and actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking in a cooling period while maintaining a service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the average of the last 4 periods to represent the current demand regime (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late July/early August: 4-period average (P22-P25) is 69.25 units, significantly lower than the May peak of 137.

Daily Reward (R_t): $461.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' (603145001) has significantly cooled following the May/June peak, currently stabilizing at a lower regime as observed in late July and early August. The most recent demand was only 28 units, and the 5-period average (P22-P26) is 61 units. Period 26 demand was notably low (28), potentially indicating a further step down or just high variance; however, the cooling trend is clearly established compared to the peak of 137. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory while maintaining a sufficient service level for this high-profit item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will focus on the most recent stabilized regime. Using N=5 for mu_hat captures the post-peak stability (average 61), and N=5 for sigma_hat captures the recent volatility adjustments. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the significantly lower August demand profile compared to the historical average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $479.00

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 603145001 has entered a significant downward trend following the May/June peak. The most recent two periods (P26 and P27) recorded demands of 28 and 29 respectively, which is a sharp drop from the July average of ~69. This decline likely reflects seasonal cooling for this basic cotton jersey product as we move into late August. Given the 'Promised lead time' of 0 and historical observation that orders consistently arrive in the same period (actual lead time = 0), I am setting L to the default. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using a 'recent_N' of 4 to capture this most recent August stabilization/decline (Periods 24-27) which averages approximately 53.5 units. This ensures we don't over-order based on the much higher May/June/July volumes while keeping enough stock on hand to meet current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed in August: Average demand for Periods 26-27 dropped to ~28.5 units, a significant decrease from the July average of ~69 units and the June peak of 137.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 603145001 is currently in a sustained downward trend as we move into late August. The peak demand observed in June/July has fully subsided. The most recent three periods (P26-P28) show demand figures of 28, 29, and 19 units, yielding a 3-period average of 25.3 units. This confirms the downward shift noted in the Carry-over Insight for Period 28. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, it is optimal to maintain a safe service level, but we must align \u03bc\u0302 with the current low-demand regime (approximately 25 units per period) to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this most recent cooling phase.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' (SKU 603145001) has entered a stable low-demand period following its summer peak. In August (Periods 26-29), demand has consistently remained low, with values of 28, 29, 19, and 21. This confirms a significant downward regime shift previously noted. The average of the last 4 periods is 24.25 units. The actual lead time has consistently returned to 0 periods. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), the target service level remains high, but we must lower the demand parameters mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid accumulating unnecessary excess inventory during this seasonal cooling phase. I will use a window of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this current late-summer/early-autumn demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level for late August/early September: 4-period average (P26-P29) is 24.25 units, down from the June peak of 137 and July average of ~69.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 (Angela hipster briefs) is experiencing a sustained downward trend in demand as the summer season ends. From a peak of 137 units/week in June, demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level. The most recent 5-period average (Periods 26-30) is 22.6 units (28, 29, 19, 21, 16). The last two periods specifically show demand dipping below 20 (19 and 16). Given this clear cooling trend into September, I am setting the demand regime length N=5 to capture this lower baseline while maintaining some buffer for volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 46, which covers approximately 2 periods of recent demand, so the OR backend will likely minimize new orders to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' has stabilized at a significantly lower level since mid-August. The most recent 6-period demand average (P26-P31) is 22.16 units, showing consistent cooling compared to the summer peak. Since Period 28, demand has fluctuated between 16 and 29 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 25 units, which is almost exactly the recent weekly average. Given the promised lead time (L=0) and the demonstrated stability of actual lead time (consistently 0), I will target a base stock level based on the last 6 periods of demand to prevent overstocking as we enter mid-September.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new low in September: 6-period average (P26-P31) is 22.16 units, confirming a sustained departure from the August average of ~28.5 and July average of ~69.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 603145001 has entered a stable, low-volume regime following a peak in June and a steady decline through July and August. Over the last seven periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged 21.8 units (28, 29, 19, 21, 16, 21, 19). The most recent three periods (P30-P32) are even tighter, averaging 18.7 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units. I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand state and prevent overstocking as we move further into September.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 is currently in a low-demand regime typical for the late summer/early autumn period. However, Period 33 saw a sudden spike to 52 units, which resulted in a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This spike is significantly higher than the 6-period average of ~22 units identified in the Period 32 insight. While it's unclear if this is a sustained regime shift or a one-off fluctuation, the inventory is depleted. I need to reset mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this recent volatility and ensure we recover from the stockout. I will use a shorter window (recent_N=4) to capture the impact of the recent spike (averaging ~27 units) while still reflecting the generally lower seasonal levels compared to the June peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained low demand regime since August (averaging ~20-25 units) was interrupted by a sharp spike of 52 units in Period 33 (Sept 23), causing a stockout.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 is a basic underwear item (Divided Basics hipster). In Period 35 (2019/10/07), we are operating in a post-summer low-demand regime, which generally stabilized between 20-25 units since Period 26. However, an unexpected spike to 52 units in Period 33 caused a temporary stockout, followed by a return to 27 units in Period 34. This suggests that while base demand is low, volatility remains a factor (likely due to its 'Basics' nature and promotional sensitivity). The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To avoid holding excess inventory during this lower-demand phase while still protecting against spikes like the one seen in P33, I will use a balanced lookback window. I'm choosing N=9 for mu_hat (covering Periods 26-34) to capture the low-demand regime while weighting the recent spike appropriately. For sigma_hat, I will use a shorter window (N=5) to more heavily weight recent volatility fluctuations.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton hipster briefs) is currently in a stabilized low-demand regime following a high-volatility peak in May/June. Historically, demand for this item sees a massive surge during late Spring (May/June peak of ~137), cools through Summer, and settles into a baseline of ~20-25 units in Autumn (September/October). Period 33 witnessed a brief outlier spike (52 units), but demand has since returned to the expected low level (27 and 18 units in Periods 34 and 35). Current on-hand inventory is 32 units, and the actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while autumn demand is low, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the stabilized regime since August (Periods 27-35), which averages approximately 24.8 units. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect the reduced but present volatility (including the P33 spike).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for 'Angela hipster' (cotton jersey briefs) has stabilized in a lower regime following a significant spring/summer peak. Since Period 26 (early August), demand has consistently averaged around 25 units per week, with occasional spikes (e.g., 52 units in P33 and 36 units in P36). The most recent 3-period average (P34-P36) is 27 units, which aligns with the post-peak stability identified in earlier insights. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current stabilized demand while accounting for recent fluctuations (volatility), I am setting mu_hat using a recent 6-period average (N=6) covering Periods 31-36, which averages 28.8 units. This period length balances the recent stability with the occasional spikes observed in late September and October. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same 6 periods to ensure the safety stock reflects recent volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this item (cotton jersey hipster briefs) has shown a recent increase from the stable late-August/September low. Specifically, the last four periods (P34-P37) show demands of 27, 18, 36, and 44, with an average of 31.25. This is an increase from the previous 'new low' regime of ~22 units. Note that Period 33 also had a spike of 52. The recent trend (36 and 44) suggests we are exiting the low-demand trough and potentially entering a pre-holiday or early winter regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this current uptick while masking the extremely low values from September, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the average and volatility of the last month of data.

Carry-over insight: Demand began rising in October: 4-period average (P34-P37) increased to 31.25 units from the September average of ~22 units (+42%).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 603145001 is currently entering November. Historically, demand for this 'Divided Basics' hipster brief saw a major regime shift beginning in Feb (avg ~100) and peaking in May/June (avg ~137) before cooling significantly in August/September (avg ~22). In October, a recovery was noted (avg ~31). The last five periods (P34-P38) show demands of 27, 18, 36, 44, and 25 (mean 30). Given the product category (basic underwear) and the upcoming holiday season, I expect demand to continue its gradual recovery from the summer lows. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (Periods 34-38) to capture the upward shift from the summer trough while remaining responsive to the current moderate demand levels. This N balances the recent higher volatility (range 18-44) with the stabilized October trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend confirmed in October: 5-period average (P34-P38) is 30 units, up from the Sept average of ~22 units (+36%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for item 603145001 (underwear) showed a gradual recovery trend in October (averaging ~30 units) but dropped sharply to 11 units in Period 39. Historically, demand for this SKU has been highly volatile with significant regime shifts (e.g., May peak of 137 vs. September low of 22). Given we are entering the mid-November period, we should anticipate potential holiday-related demand increases or 'Singles Day' effects, even though the most recent data point (P39) was low. A 6-period average (P34-P39) is 26.8 units, while the October recovery average was ~30. To balance the risk of stockouts during a potential November uptick against the current on-hand inventory (36 units), I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the recent range of 11-44 units, and use sigma_hat for the same period to account for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~12). Lead time (L) remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in November: Period 39 dropped to 11 units after an October recovery average of ~30. Evaluating for potential seasonal shifts as mid-November approaches.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Inventory is at 34 units with none in transit. Historically, lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Demand analysis shows a significant cooling since the summer peak. After an October recovery where demand averaged ~30 units (P34-P38), demand in the most recent two periods (P39-P40) has dropped to 11 and 13 units respectively. This suggests the October recovery was short-lived or the market is entering a quieter November phase before any holiday potential. Using a recent_N of 7 for demand (covering P34-P40) captures the current volatility and the shift from the higher October average to the lower November levels, providing a mean of ~24.8. This balances the risk of another spike (like the 52 in P33) against the risk of overstocking during a apparent low-demand phase. Lead time remains 'default' (0) as evidenced by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening in November: Demand for P39-P40 averaged 12 units, down from the October recovery average of 30 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained low-demand regime for late November. Since Period 39 (Nov 4), demand has been consistently low: 11, 13, and 11. This follows a brief recovery in October where demand averaged ~30. The current 3-period average (P39-P41) is 11.67 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the product is 'Angela hipster' underwear, we are observing a seasonal trough before potential December holiday spikes. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect this current low regime (11.67 x 1) while maintaining a baseline sigma_hat using the same window to handle the low volatility currently observed. This ensures the OR backend targets a lean inventory levels to minimize holding costs while the demand is stagnant.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower trough in November: 3-period average (P39-P41) is 11.67 units, down from the October recovery average of 30 units (-61%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. Demand for the product (hipster briefs) has stabilized at a lower trough throughout November, with a recent 4-period average (P39-P42) of 14 units. However, Period 42 saw a slight uptick to 21 units, potentially signaling the start of early December holiday-related demand or standard variability. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Given the low demand regime observed over the last month (averaging 12-14 units), I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stable low-demand period while remaining sensitive to the small increase seen in the most recent period. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected low demand without accumulating excessive holding costs, as the profit margin is high ($19) relative to holding costs ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in November at a lower trough: 4-period average (P39-P42) is 14 units, significantly lower than the October recovery average of 30 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early December (2019/12/09). Historically, this SKU (hipster underwear) experienced a significant demand spike during the spring and early summer (May/June), followed by a cooling down through August and September. Since November (Period 39), demand has stabilized at a low trough, with the most recent 5-period average (P39-P43) being 13 units (11, 13, 11, 21, 9). Although December can see gift-related retail surges, there is no evidence yet in the data for this specific SKU appearing in the last few weeks. Therefore, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this current stable low-demand window (mean ~13, which equates to mu_hat \u2248 13 for L=0) while maintaining enough buffer for small spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-December (2019/12/16, Period 45). Examining the recent demand history: Period 44 saw 7 units, Period 43 saw 9 units, Period 42 saw 21 units, and Period 41 saw 11 units. The 4-period average is 12 units. This follows a sustained low trough in November which averaged 14 units (Periods 39-42). Given we are approaching the end of the year, demand for basic cotton underwear is likely to remain stable or slightly decrease further as consumer focus shifts to festive or winter-specific apparel. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the stable but low demand levels seen since early November while accounting for the small volatility observed in Period 42. Since there is no on-hand stockout and demand is currently very low, the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain the desired service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a stable low trough since early November: 6-period average (P39-P44) is 12 units, confirming the end of the mild October recovery and a return to late-August levels.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Period 45 saw a major demand spike of 76 units (up from an average of ~12 units in the previous 6 periods). This spike is consistent with pre-Christmas and holiday shopping for basic apparel like 'Angela hipster' briefs. This surge caused a total stockout (ending on-hand: 0). Given that Period 46 is Dec 23 and Period 47 will cover the post-Christmas/New Year week, I expect demand to remain elevated but likely transition into clearance/post-holiday stabilization. I am shifting mu_hat to 'explicit' to account for this holiday volatility, setting it to 60 units (reflecting a blend of the recent spike and expected post-holiday cooling). Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' to 30 to cover the high forecast uncertainty. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant holiday demand spike observed in Period 45 (76 units), breaking the stable low trough of ~12 units. This aligns with late December retail seasonality.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final period (Period 47: Dec 30) of the game. Historical analysis shows a significant holiday demand spike in the last two periods: Period 45 (76 units) and Period 46 (97 units), following a long period of low demand (~12 units). Given the current date is Dec 30, we are in the peak holiday/New Year's Eve season for 'Angela hipster' underwear. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maximize profit in this final period and satisfy the elevated holiday demand, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last two peak periods (approx. 87 units) using the explicit method. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (recent_N=3) to account for the sudden volatility and ensure enough stock to prevent another stockout, as seen in Period 45.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: late December demand averaged 86.5 units (P45-P46), a 7x increase over the November trough of ~12 units.
