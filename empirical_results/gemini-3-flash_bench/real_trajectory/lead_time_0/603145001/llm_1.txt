Analyzing the historical demand (59, 14, 28, 85, 85), the mean demand is approximately 54.2 units per week. February 11th is the week of Valentine's Day (Feb 14), which typically creates a demand spike for lingerie and underwear categories. Recent historical demand (P4 and P5) shows a significant jump to 85 units, which likely reflects the lead-up to this holiday. For Period 1, I expect demand to remain high or slightly taper as Valentine's Day passes. The promised lead time (L) is 0, meaning orders placed now arrive during this period and are available to satisfy this period's demand. To satisfy expected demand (~85 units) and maintain a safety stock for Period 2, I will order a total of 150 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are currently 0, the full amount is ordered now.",

  "rationale": "The SKU is a basic underwear item (Angela hipster). Current date is Dec 30, 2019. Historically, the demand demonstrated a massive holiday surge: Period 45 (mid-Dec) jumped to 76 units and Period 46 (late Dec) reached 97 units. Given that Period 47 (Dec 30) spans the New Year period, demand is expected to remain high before potentially tapering off in early January. Looking back at early January 2019 (Historical Demand Data), the first week of Jan saw 59 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0. My on-hand inventory is only 3 units. To cover the current period's demand (expected to be between 60-90 units based on the Dec trend and Jan 2019 baseline) while avoiding high holding costs for the post-holiday period, I will order 85 units. This ensures I can satisfy current demand and leaves a small buffer for the start of the next period.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Holiday demand peak extended: Dec 23 week (Period 46) saw 97 units, maintaining the high demand regime started in Period 45.",
