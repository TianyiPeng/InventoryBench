Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a declining trend from 36 to 16, with an average of approximately 19 units per period. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 37 units based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, aiming to cover demand for current and future periods (L+1=3). My demand analysis: the 3-period lead-time window demand expectation (3 * 19) is roughly 57 units. However, the OR recommendation is capped to smooth volatility. Given the declining trend and the nature of the product (everyday basic), I will follow the OR's recommendation of 37 units to build initial stock.

We placed an initial order of 37 units (which is currently in-transit). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and become visible in Period 4. Analysis of the historical demand samples (36, 21, 10, 12, 16) and the most recent Period 1 demand (46) suggests a potential upward trend or volatility in demand for this 'Everyday Basic' item, likely as we move further into the spring season. The OR recommendation is 48 units, calculated based on promised lead time and historical demand. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a significant backlog of demand (missed 46 units last period), we need to build stock. The total pipeline inventory (In-transit) is only 37. To cover demand over the lead time (Current Period 2 + Lead Time 2 = 3 periods), we should target approximately 40-50 units per period.

Based on the 2-period lead time, the Period 1 order (37 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand was low (mean ~19). However, Period 1 (46) and Period 2 (73) show a significant upward trajectory. This SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Late February/early March often marks the start of spring shopping, explaining the surge. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 85 units (37 from P1, 48 from P2). Currently, we have 0 stock to satisfy Period 3 demand, resulting in lost sales. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR suggest 41 units. However, it uses historical mean (including the very low Jan samples) and assumes lead time = 2. Given the demand is trending much higher than the historical average (average of last two periods is 59.5), the OR's base stock is likely too low to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand needed. 5. Strategy: I need to cover demand for Periods 3, 4, and 5. Estimating demand at ~70 units per period, I need a pursuit level around 210. Current pipeline is 85. 210 - 85 - 0 (on-hand) = 125 units.

This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or shipments are delayed/lost. 2. **Inventory Analysis**: I have 0 units on-hand and 190 in-transit. Cumulative demand over the first 3 periods was 192 (46+73+73), while I have only ordered 190 units total. I am significantly under-stocked for current demand levels. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (73, 73) is much higher than the initial historical samples (averaging ~19). This suggests a demand regime shift or seasonality for this V-neck T-shirt as we move into March. 4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely sees 190 'in-transit' against historical low demand averages and assumes the inventory is sufficient. It is failing to account for the actual demand spike and the lead-time delay. 5. **Decision**: I need to place a significant order to cover the (L+1) horizon. Calculating base stock for P4-P7: Assuming demand remains ~73/week, I need ~292 units to cover the window. Current pipeline is 190.

However, the P1 order (37 units) is missing, suggesting it might be a lost shipment. 2. Demand Analysis: The SKU 'T-shirt in cotton jersey' is entering a seasonal peak (Spring). Historical demand was low (avg 19), but recent demand has spiked significantly: P1: 46, P2: 73, P3: 73, P4: 142. The 4-week average is 83.5, with the most recent week showing a surge to 142. 3. Inventory & OR Review: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 244 units (likely 105 from P3 and 102 from P4, plus the 'lost' 37 from P1). OR recommends 0 because it assumes a much lower demand mean based on the older historical samples (10-36 range) and counts the pipeline as full. 4. Strategy: I must override the OR recommendation. The pipeline (excluding the likely lost P1 order) is 207 units. Total demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at the current rate of ~140/week would be 420. Even at a more conservative mean of ~90, we need 270. With 0 on-hand and 207 reliable in-transit, we are under-stocked for the spring surge.

The current in-transit inventory of 364 units consists of orders from P3 (105 units), P4 (102 units), and P5 (120 units - total 327 verified plus the lost P1 units). Since the P2 order arrived on time, I will assume a lead time of 2 for current logistics.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Extreme regime shift observed. Historical baseline was ~19, but recent demand (P4: 142, P5: 234) indicates a massive surge, likely seasonal for a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt' entering Spring (March). The mean for the last 5 periods is ~113.6, but the trend is steeply upward.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Expected arrivals for P6 are from P4 (102 units). Expected demand for P6 is likely >200. We are significantly under-stocked. \n\n4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 0 units because it calculates the 'in-transit' (364) against a demand model that uses all history (back to Jan), leading to a low base-stock level.

On-hand is 329.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: This SKU (Women's Everyday Basic T-shirt) experienced a massive surge starting mid-February, peaking at over 300 units in March. However, the most recent demand (Period 8) dropped significantly to 94 units. This suggests either a post-peak stabilization or a seasonal dip after a spring stock-up. The average demand across recent high periods (P4-P8) is approximately 206. \n3. **Inventory Position**: Total inventory (On-hand 329 + In-transit 394) = 723 units. With the 3-period coverage requirement (L+1 = 3), this covers an average demand of 241 units per period. If demand has stabilized at ~200 or is declining toward 100, we are currently overstocked.\n4. **OR Comparison**: the OR recommends 0. This is because the uncapped total inventory (723) is much higher than the base stock calculated using the full sample mean (which is tilted lower by the early P1-P3 data). \n5. **Adjustment**: Given the sharp drop in Period 8 demand (94) and the high stock level (723), no new order is required.

However, the 'In-transit' pipeline is very high at 594 units. Looking at the history, this includes orders from Period 10 (200 units, significantly overdue and likely lost), Period 13 (50 units), Period 14 (100 units), and potentially others not yet concluded. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the orders from P13 and P14 should have arrived by now. \n3. **Shipment Reliability**: History shows a pattern of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and likely P10). However, P11 and P12 both arrived successfully with a lead time of 2. Even if we assume P10 (200 units) is lost, the P13 (50) and P14 (100) orders are only slightly delayed or pending arrival. \n4. **Strategy**: The pipeline (594) even after subtracting likely lost orders (P1: 37, P3: 105, P4: 102, P10: 200 = 444 total) still contains ~150 units which is more than enough to cover 2-3 periods of current demand (~63/period).

Demand over the last 6 periods (P18-P23) has been 173, 217, 159, 178, 174, and 203, averaging approx. 184 units per period. 4. Strategic Calculation: To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the current average rate (~184 * 3 = 552 units), our effective inventory of 623 units is currently sufficient to avoid stockouts in the immediate window. 5. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 0 units, likely because it perceives the massive (but lost) 'In-transit' quantity as available stock. While the inventory is sufficient for the next 2-3 periods, I will place a maintenance order of 150 units to ensure continuity as we move through late July/August, accounting for the high risk of shipment loss observed in this environment.",

Based on history: P1-P14, P19, P24, and P26 orders are long overdue and confirmed lost (totaling 1594 units, though 'In-transit' shows 1494 likely due to internal system caps or adjustments). Specifically, the arrived units in P32 (150 from P30 and 100 from P31) cleaned out the recent valid pipeline. Currently, there is 0 valid in-transit inventory from orders placed in P32.\nLead Time: Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods (P30 arrived in 2, P31 arrived in 1).

Lead-time Inference: Actual lead-time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods (promised is 2). The P32 order (placed 3 periods ago) has not yet arrived, suggesting a lead time of 3+ or a potential loss. Strategy: We need to cover demand for the lead-time plus review period (L+1 = 3 to 4 periods). 4 periods of demand at ~120/period is 480 units. With a valid pipeline of 450 units and 0 on-hand, we are near the requirement. However, the OS recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 'In-transit' number.

Demand has entered a low-season stabilization phase as we approach the end of the year (November), with recent demand averaging ~31 units/period over the last four periods (P38-P41). This follows a summer peak (P17-P25) and a secondary fall spike (P30-P33). On-hand inventory is currently 155 units. Given the recent average demand of 31 units, the current stock covers approximately 5 periods of demand. Although the 'In-transit' figure is high (1494), carry-over insights correctly identify 1,744 units as lost (including all orders prior to P42). Since the valid pipeline is effectively zero, I must rely on the existing 155 units. With 5 periods remaining in the game (P42-P47) and a mean demand of ~31, I have sufficient stock to cover the remaining lifespan without incurring significant stockout risk or additional holding costs.

Current on-hand inventory is 95 units, which covers approximately 2.5 periods of the current demand regime.

With a lead time of 2 periods and an expected demand of ~40 units, the system currently holds enough stock to fulfill demand through Period 44 (95/40 = 2.375). Ordering 100 units now ensures replenishment arrives by Period 45, preventing a stockout as current inventory depletes. This overrides the OR recommendation of 0, which likely ignores the fact that the entire 'In-Transit' inventory is phantom/lost and that current stock will be exhausted within two weeks.",

However, recent performance shows some consistency: the P43 order arrived in P45 (L=2). \n2. **Demand Analysis**: The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt.' Demand peaked in early spring (P6: 311) and summer (P19: 217). It has now stabilized significantly in the winter months. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is ~26 units/period. \n3. **Inventory Position**: Current On-hand is 124 units. With no valid In-transit stock (all 1,494 units are lost), the 124 units represent approximately 4.7 periods of cover based on the current demand rate (~26/period).\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0. Given the high stock cover (4.7 periods) relative to the promised lead time (2 periods) and the low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4), there is no immediate risk of stockout.
