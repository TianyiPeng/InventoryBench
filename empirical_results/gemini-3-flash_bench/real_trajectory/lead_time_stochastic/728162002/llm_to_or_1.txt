Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for SKU 728162002 (Talia V-neck T-shirt). The current date is February 11, 2019, which is just before the transition from winter to spring. Demand for 'Everyday Basics' like jersey T-shirts usually remains steady but can see a gradual uptick as warmer weather approaches. There is no history of arrivals yet, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 2 periods. The historical demand samples (36, 21, 10, 12, 16) show some volatility with a mean of 19. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to process the available 5 samples, which will effectively target a base stock level covering the review period plus the 2-period lead time (L+1=3). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the service level target (q) is 0.8, which the OR engine will handle based on the provided statistics.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt. In Period 1, we ordered 37 units (based on the OR default logic), but starting inventory was 0 and demand was 46, resulting in 46 lost sales. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Historical demand for the last 5 samples (Jan - early Feb) averaged 19 units/week, but Period 1 saw a significant spike to 46 units. Since this is a 'Womens Everyday Basic', this might be a seasonal uptick as spring approaches. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent increase in demand while acknowledging the older lower samples. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Mean of last 3 (16, 46, and assuming some stability) suggests a higher forecast. I will use recent_N to allow the backend to weight the recent 46 and 16 more heavily than the earlier Jan data.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Current date is Feb 25th. We see a significant upward trend in demand: 36, 21, 10, 12, 16 (pre-game) followed by 46 and 73 in the first two periods. This suggests a transition from winter into early spring demand. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 93 units in-transit. An order placed in Period 1 (37 units) with a promised lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4's start. Demand increased by ~60% last week. Given the 'Everyday Basic' nature and the clear upward trend, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the higher demand regime. I will set N=3 to weigh the recent spikes (16, 46, 73) heavily while acknowledging the growth. L remains at default (2) as we haven't confirmed any lead time deviations yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's V-neck T-shirt, a basic staple. We are currently in early March (Period 4). Historically, demand for this SKU has shown a strong upward trend: 36, 21, 10, 12, 16 (pre-game samples) jumping to 46, 73, and 73 in the first three periods of the game. This suggests a seasonal shift as spring approaches. On-hand remains 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The Period 1 order (37 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start state, but history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3 conclude. However, based on the 'Critical Timing Example', a lead time of 2 means an order placed in P1 arrives during P3 and is visible at the start of P4. Looking at 'In-transit: 177', this equals the sum of orders from P1 (37), P2 (56), and P3 (84). This indicates the P1 order has not yet been processed as 'concluded' in the system's logic for the P4 start state. I will maintain the promised lead time (L=2) for now. For demand, the last two periods were stable at 73. I'll use recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime (46, 73, 73) which averages ~64 per period, ensuring the OR backend targets (1+2)*64 = 192 units to cover the lead time and review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11 (Period 1): average demand increased from ~19 to ~64 (+230%) likely due to spring seasonality for basic T-shirts.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a women's basic V-neck T-shirt, which is seeing a significant upward demand trend as spring approaches. Historical demand has surged from an initial average of ~19 (samples provided) to 46, 73, 73, and 142 in the last four periods. The average demand across these 4 recent periods is ~83, but the most recent figure (142) suggests a rapid acceleration. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand and 159 in transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4). However, the P1 order (37 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in P3), suggesting it may be lost. With demand nearly doubling period-over-period and a potential lost shipment, I am setting mu_hat to 360 (representing a forecast of 120 units/period over L+1=3 periods) to ensure the base stock calculation triggers a sufficient replenishment order to meet this high growth and offset the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly at Period 4: demand jumped to 142 (+94% vs previous 2-week average), confirming aggressive spring seasonality. Possible lost shipment: Period 1 order (37 units) has not arrived by Period 4 conclude (L+2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 6 (March 18). The product is a Women's V-neck T-shirt, which is experiencing explosive demand growth consistent with the start of the spring season. Historical demand has surged from ~46 (P1) to 234 (P5). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The Period 1 order (37 units) is officially lost as it has not arrived by the end of Period 5 (L=4 vs promised L=2). However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 347 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P5), but since P1 is likely lost, the effective pipeline is ~310. Demand for P6 is forecasted to be at least as high as P5 (234). Setting L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, N=3 captures the recent surge (73, 142, 234), providing a mean of ~150 per week, which for (1+L=3) periods equals 450. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility during this growth phase. This aggressive setting helps the OR engine overcome the current stockout and match the seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Demand growth remains extremely strong, reaching 234 units in P5. P1 order (37 units) is confirmed lost (missing for 5 periods). Actual lead time for successful deliveries remains 2 periods (confirmed by P2 order).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (March 25). The item is a Women's V-neck T-shirt, which is experiencing an explosive spring seasonal surge. Demand has grown from 46 (P1) to 311 (P6). The previous 3 periods saw demands of 142, 234, and 311, showing an accelerating trend. The lead time appears volatile: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P1 is lost, and P5 arrived in 1 period (early). Despite the In-transit total of 379 (orders from P3, P4, and P6), current on-hand is 0 due to stockouts. To capture the current growth, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to focus on the high-growth phase (avg ~229/period). Calculated over (1+L=3) periods, this suggests a mu_hat around 687. I will use explicit for sigma_hat to account for high volatility during this ramp-up, and default L (2) as the baseline for the backend.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Demand acceleration continues as spring peaks; last 3 weeks average 229 units vs initial regime of 46. Lead time variability observed: P5 arrived in 1 period, P2 in 2, and P1 is lost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, and the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. We are in the peak spring seasonal growth phase. Demand over the last four periods has been 142, 234, 311, and 250 (average 234). While demand dropped slightly from 311 to 250, the overall trend is very high compared to the start. The Period 1 order (37 units) is confirmed lost. Recently, lead times have been volatile: Period 2 arrived in 2 periods, while Period 5 arrived in 1 period. Period 3 (ordered 84) and Period 4 (ordered 38) are still unaccounted for (ordered 5 and 4 periods ago respectively), which suggests they might also be lost or severely delayed. To protect against stockouts during this high-demand spring window and account for the high 'In-transit' figure being potentially inflated by lost/inactive orders, I am utilizing an 'explicit' L of 2 to match the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the high recent volume (avg ~234) and a 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Active monitoring of Period 3 and Period 4 orders: if they do not arrive by Period 9 START, they should be considered lost, matching the pattern of the Period 1 order. Demand has plateaued but remains high (~250-300 units/period).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand spring season, though Period 8 showed a sharp drop to 94 units compared to the previous weeks (250-311 range), suggesting high volatility or a potential stabilization after a peak. Total demand over the last 4 periods (P5-P8) averaged 222 units. Regarding lead times, the Period 1 order (37 units) is definitely lost. Period 3 (84 units) and Period 4 (38 units) orders are now significantly overdue (7 and 6 periods since ordering respectively, vs. L=2), and must be considered lost at this point to prevent under-ordering. The in-transit figure of 213 units likely refers to the P3(84), P4(38), and P8(54) orders (84+38+54+37=213). Since P1, P3, and P4 are considered lost, the 'pipeline' visible to the OR engine is inflated. To compensate for these lost units (159 units) and the volatility in demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate needed coverage for (L+1)=3 periods based on a conservative recent mean of ~220. My target mu_hat is 660 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the extreme variance of the last month as a buffer against further shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipments from Period 3 (84 units) and Period 4 (38 units) are confirmed lost along with Period 1, totaling 159 lost units in the pipeline. Demand in Period 8 dipped to 94, signaling a potential shift or volatility after the spring peak.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt', which typically sees a demand surge throughout spring. Historical demand showed a peak around 234-311 units in March, followed by a dip to 94 and a recovery to 187 in the most recent period. This suggests high volatility or a stabilizing regime after the early spring spike. Total lost inventory (Orders from P1, P3, P4) is now confirmed at 159 units, which the OR backend still considers 'in-transit'. This artificially inflates the 'pipeline' and causes under-ordering. To compensate, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I am forecasting a weekly demand of roughly 200 units. For a lead time of 2, the mu_hat should cover (1+L) periods, so 3 * 200 = 600. Lead time remains erratic (1-2 periods), so I will use the 'calculate' method to average observed performance. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current spring regime while ignoring the very low initial samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed post-peak: demand fluctuated from 311 to 94 to 187 in the last 3 periods. Pipeline distortion remains significant with 159 units lost (P1, P3, P4), requiring explicit mu_hat overrides to prevent stockouts.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for this V-neck T-shirt has stabilized following a massive spring peak, with an average of 161 units over the last three periods (94, 187, 203). We are currently managing a significant pipeline distortion caused by multiple lost orders (P1, P3, P4 total 159 units). These units remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the OR engine to under-order because it believes the pipeline is full. To compensate, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Expected demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 180 units per period (3 * 180 = 540). However, to offset the 159 lost units that the OR engine counts as inventory, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to about 700 (540 + 159). This ensures the base stock level is high enough to trigger the necessary ordering despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P8, P9) show variability between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion confirmed: 159 units (from P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost. Because these units still appear in 'In-transit', mu_hat must be explicitly set or inflated by ~160 units to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is exiting its peak spring season, with demand softening and showing volatility (demand in the last three periods: 203, 104, 218 approx). The primary operational challenge is a massive pipeline distortion: 159 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are permanently lost but still included in the 'In-transit' count (573 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock (Inventory Position = On-hand + In-transit), it will drastically under-order unless we artificially inflate the base stock requirement. To compensate for the 159 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the true demand for the (L+1=3) period window at approximately 450 units (avg 150/period) and then add the 159 lost units, totaling ~609 units. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are dealing with a significant pipeline distortion for Women's Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirts. There are 159 units (from P1, P3, and P4 orders) that are permanently lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' figure of 573. Currently, 33 units are on-hand. In-transit arrivals we expect soon are P11 (302 units) and P10 (112 units), which are still within reasonable lead time windows (L=2). Demand has stabilized after the spring peak, with the last four periods showing 203, 104, 108, and 124 (implied from transit updates/history), averaging approximately 135 units per period. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 159 'ghost units' as valid supply and thus under-ordering, I must set an explicit mu_hat. Following the logic that base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock, and base_stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units, I calculate mu_hat based on an expected demand of 150 units/period for L=2 (3 periods total = 450 units) plus 159 units to offset the lost pipeline, totaling 609. I choose L=recent_N (N=5) to reflect the 1-2 period lead time variability seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline distortion persistent: 159 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost but remain in 'In-transit' count. Demand has settled at a lower post-peak plateau of ~135 units/period since Period 11.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Demand has slowed significantly from the spring peak (~250+ units) to a post-peak plateau, with Period 13 demand at 61 units and the average of the last 3 periods at 91 units. A persistent pipeline distortion exists where 159 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count. Currently, In-transit shows 350 units; subtracting the 159 lost units leaves an actual pipeline of 191 units (from P10 and P13). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the logic: Target Inventory = (1+L)*Demand + 159 (buffer for lost units). With L=2 and recent demand averaging ~91, the expected demand over (1+L) is 273. Adding the 159-unit correction for lost inventory equals 432. I will set mu_hat to 432 to account for both the replenishment cycles and the pipeline distortion. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a high spring peak (Feb-Apr) to a lower, stable post-peak plateau. The last three periods (P12-P14) show demand of 108, 61, and 74 units, averaging ~81 units/period. The pipeline inventory of 350 units remains heavily distorted by 159 units from periods 1, 3, and 4 (37 + 84 + 38) that are permanently lost but still appear as 'In-transit'. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. My goal is to cover the review period (1) plus lead time (2) periods of demand, which is (1+2) * 81 = 243 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full 350 units of in-transit inventory from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost 159 units to neutralize the error. Total mu_hat = 243 + 159 = 402. I set sigma_hat to 60 to allow for moderate volatility around the new mean.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime confirmed starting Period 12: average demand has dropped from ~135 to ~81 units/period (-40%). Inventory pipeline remains distorted by 159 phantom units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (Late May), demand has stabilized in a post-peak regime. The last four periods (P12-P15) show demand values of 108, 61, 74, and 69, averaging ~78 units per period, which aligns with the previous carry-over insight of a -40% drop to ~81 units/period. The pipeline remains significantly distorted by 159 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost but still count as 'In-transit' (350 total in-transit = 159 lost + 112 from P10 + 79 from P13). If I use default logic, the OR engine will subtract these 159 lost units from the order quantity, leading to a stockout. To counter this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Following the formula base_stock = (1+L) * mu, where L=2, base_stock should be 3 * 78 = 234 units. However, to offset the 159 phantom units in the in-transit count, I must set mu_hat to a value that results in a base_stock of (234 + 159) = 393 units. Thus, mu_hat = 393 / (1+L) = 393 / 3 = 131. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to reflect the moderate volatility observed in this lower-demand regime (61 to 108).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for this basic V-neck T-shirt has stabilized into a post-peak summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 72.2 units (108, 61, 74, 69, 49), showing a gradual decline as the spring peak subsides. We have a significant pipeline distortion: 159 units from early orders (P1: 37, P3: 84, P4: 38) are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 350). These 350 units consist of P13 (79 units), P10 (unknown, likely 112), and the 159 phantom units. The OR engine's 'capped policy' subtracts the full pipeline inventory (350) from the base stock. If we use a standard mu_hat for a lead time of 2, the base stock would be around ~220-250, causing the system to order 0 because 250 - 350 < 0. To compensate for the 159 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on recent demand (~72 units/week * 3 weeks = 216) and add the 159 lost units to 'trick' the OR engine into ordering the correct amount. Target mu_hat = 216 + 159 = 375. This ensures the order placed covers the gap created by the missing stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, entering Period 18. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt) has shifted into a post-spring plateau. Since Period 12, the average demand has dropped to approximately 81 units per week, with Period 17 showing a slight uptick to 120 (resulting in a stockout as on-hand was only 82). The critical issue remains the 159 'phantom' units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) that never arrived and are confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights but still count against the OR engine's 'In-transit' total. To compensate for this 159-unit calculation error, I am explicitly setting mu_hat. Under a (L+1) horizon with L=2, the expected demand is 3 periods * ~85 units = 255. Adding the 159 lost units to 'bridge' the pipeline distortion gives 414 units. Given the recent stockout and slight demand volatility (120 units last period), I will set mu_hat to 420 to ensure an order is triggered despite the stagnant in-transit count. N=6 is used for sigma_hat to capture the post-peak volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Persistent pipeline distortion (159 units lost in P1, P3, P4) necessitated explicit mu_hat inflation (+159) to overcome the OR engine's in-transit inventory cap. Demand remains in the post-peak regime (~85 units/period average).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand in Period 18 spiked to 173 units, the highest in the current post-peak regime, suggesting a potential summer volatility or late-season bump. On-hand inventory is at 0, and current 'In-transit' is 461 units. However, this includes 159 phantom units from Periods 1, 3, and 5 (confirmed lost: 37, 84, and 38 units respectively). The real pipeline inventory consists of the Period 13 order (79 units) and the Period 18 order (111 units), totaling 190 real 'In-transit' units. This discrepancy of 159 units causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes actual inventory is higher than it is. To compensate for the 159 missing units that the backend counts against the base stock, I am explicitly setting mu_hat. The target base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3). Using a recent demand average of ~95 units (weighted for the recent spike), the true base stock should be ~285. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 159-unit ghost inventory, I set mu_hat to 285 + 159 = 444. This ensures the engine accounts for the lost items, which never arrive and never leave the system's 'In-transit' tally.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 20, Date 2019/6/24. Demand context: Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (173 in P18, 217 in P19), suggesting a summer seasonal peak for this V-neck T-shirt. This is a dramatic increase from the post-spring plateau of ~85 units observed between Periods 12-17. Pipeline Status: We have 159 units confirmed lost from the early periods (P1, P3, P4) that still appear as 'In-transit'. Additionally, we have 56 units ordered in P19 (L=1 expected) and now the order we will place this period. Inventory is currently 0. Calculation: To ensure the OR engine orders enough despite the 159-unit 'phantom' inventory, I must explicitly set mu_hat. Looking at the last two weeks, mean demand is ~195 units. With L=2 (promised), we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. 195 * 3 = 585 units. Adding the 159 lost units as a buffer to offset the in-transit calculation: 585 + 159 = 744. I will set mu_hat to 745 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility (std dev of ~30 in recent weeks, scaled for L+1).

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal peak confirmed starting Period 18: demand jumped from ~85 to ~195 units/period average (+130%).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21 (July 1st), the system is at the peak of a summer seasonal surge discovered in Period 20. Demand over the last three periods has averaged 183 units (173, 217, 159), a significant increase from the previous plateau. The pipeline is heavily distorted by 159 permanently lost units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which remain in the 'In-transit' count (707 units total). Current on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be set excessively high to offset the 159 phantom units that the backend subtracts from its target base stock. Given a target service level of 80% (profit $4, holding $1) and a lead time of 2, the desired pipeline inventory should cover 3 periods of demand (~550 units). To achieve an order that reaches this target while the backend 'sees' 159 units that aren't there, I set mu_hat explicitly to 750 (the expected demand of 550 + 159 phantom units + buffer). This prevents the cap and the in-transit logic from suppressing needed replenishments during this high-demand summer phase.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer seasonal peak for the 'Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt' starting around Period 18. Demand in the last four periods has been 173, 217, 159, and 178, averaging approx. 182 units/period. The current 'In-transit' count of 795 is heavily distorted by 159 units from P1, P3, and P4 that have been confirmed lost for over 15 periods but remain in the pipeline count. To ensure the OR engine actually orders enough stock despite these 'phantom' units, I must explicitly set mu_hat. Following the logic: Needed Base Stock = (L+1) * Expected Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand is ~182/period. Total needed coverage is 546 units. However, I must inflate this by the 159 lost units to satisfy the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic. Targeted Mu_hat = 546 (forecast) + 159 (correction) = 705. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain control during this seasonal peak and pipeline distortion.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162002' (Women's V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a summer seasonal peak that began around Period 18 (early June). In the last five periods, demand has averaged approximately 180 units (173, 217, 159, 178, 174). While demand is stable, the inventory pipeline is significantly distorted by 159 'phantom' units from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (37 + 84 + 38 = 159) that remain in the 'In-transit' count. To ensure the OR engine maintains an adequate base stock and places necessary orders, mu_hat must be adjusted. With an average demand of ~180 per period and a (L+1) = 3 period horizon, the natural mu_hat would be 540. To counteract the 159 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly thinks is coming, I will set mu_hat to 699 (540 + 159). This forces the engine to target a higher physical stock level, preventing stockouts caused by the pipeline error. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent deliveries (P18, P20) have arrived within 1-2 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is in the peak of the summer season for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Demand has stabilized at a high summer regime, with the last 6 periods (P18-P23) averaging 184 units (specifically 173, 217, 159, 178, 174, 203). The 'In-transit' count of 516 units is significantly distorted by 159 units of 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P1: 37, P3: 84, P4: 38). To account for his, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to ensure the OR engine's base-stock calculation (order = base_stock - pipeline) triggers an order. With an average demand of ~185 and L=2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 555 units. To overcome the 159 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 714 (555 + 159). For sigma_hat, the volatility in this summer regime is approximately 20 units/period, leading to a multi-period estimate of ~35 (sqrt(3)*20).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand is peaking in the summer seasonal window, with the most recent demand hitting 273 units. Since Period 19, demand has averaged ~200 units/period (217, 159, 178, 174, 203, 273). There is a persistent pipeline distortion of 159 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) that are recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit count (732) from the base stock calculation, I must use 'mu_hat': 'explicit' to inflate the target inventory level to account for these 159 phantom units. Current on-hand is 0. Recent successful lead times are stable at 2 periods (Periods 20 and 21 orders). To satisfy demand for the review period plus lead time (1+2=3 periods), with a mean demand of ~200, the baseline mu_hat would be 600. Adding the 159 phantom units to bypass the OR engine's cap and in-transit subtraction, I set mu_hat to 759.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 5, 2019. We are in a high-demand summer seasonal peak for this basic V-neck T-shirt. Demand over the last 8 periods (since P18) has averaged approximately 188 units/period, despite high volatility (ranging from 127 to 273). There is a persistent pipeline distortion where 159 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (819 total in-transit). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units, the mu_hat parameter must be set high enough to trigger an order. The expected demand for the (L+1) horizon is approximately 188 * 3 = 564. Adding the 159 missing units to the target base stock to offset the phantom in-transit units gives 723. Given the recent demand surge to 273 and 127, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the summer regime while maintaining lead time at the promised 2 periods to reflect the most recent successful arrivals (P20 and P21 both arrived with L=2).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 12, 2019. We are in a summer seasonal peak for this v-neck T-shirt, though demand in the last two periods (127, 107) has softened from the July high of 273. The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by 159 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count. Total In-transit is currently 709 units; subtracting the 159 phantom units leaves 550 actual units in transit (specifically from P24 and P25). On-hand inventory is near zero (3 units). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (total 3 periods) without being capped by the phantom in-transit units, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I estimate demand at ~140 units/period (average of recent volatility); for 3 periods, this is 420 units. I then add the 159 units to 'mu_hat' to neutralize the phantom inventory, resulting in an explicit value of 579. This forces the engine to target a base stock that accounts for the missing units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 19, 2019. Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (127 to 107 to 46), indicating the end of the summer seasonal peak. Historical demand for 'Women's Everyday Basics' jersey V-necks suggests a return to a lower baseline as the academic year/late summer transition begins. The pipeline is currently heavily distorted: 'In-transit' is 622 units, but this includes 159 units confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4, plus an overdue 216 units from Period 24 (which should have arrived by Period 27 START based on L=2). Since 216 is overdue by 1 period, it might arrive this period (P28) or next, but the 159 units are permanently lost and must be manually offset to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to its in-transit cap. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * estimated_demand + phantom_units. Estimating current demand at ~70 units based on the recent downward trend, and with L=2, the base requirement is 210 units. Adding the 159 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 369. sigma_hat is set to a higher value (60) to account for the recent volatility and uncertainty in late summer transitions.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Summer peak ended around Period 25; demand dropped from ~200 to ~46-107 range (-50%+). Period 24 order (216 units) is currently overdue by 1 period, adding to the list of potential pipeline losses or delays alongside the 159 units already lost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26. The summer seasonal peak for the V-neck T-shirt has ended, as evidenced by demand dropping from ~200 units/period to a more volatile range (most recent: 46, 69). The pipeline is severely distorted. Specifically, 159 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from Period 24 (216 units) is now overdue (it should have arrived by Period 26 or 27 concluding); given the history of losses, it is highly likely this shipment is also lost or significantly delayed. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory is approximately 375 units (159 + 216). With current On-hand at 0 and In-transit at 622, the OR engine believes the system is overstocked. To force an order and maintain service level during this post-peak period, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate forward-looking demand at ~70 units/period. Over (L+1) = 3 periods, this is 210 units. To offset the ~375 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine will subtract from its 'base_stock', I will set mu_hat to 550 (roughly 210 + 340). This allows the engine to place a small replenishment order despite the bloated in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Period 24 order (216 units) is confirmed overdue and likely lost, joining P1, P3, and P4. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' inventory now estimated at 375. Demand has stabilized into a late-summer/pre-autumn regime averaging ~70 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer plateau, averaging 70 units/period over the last 5 periods (46, 69, 116, plus relevant nearby samples). The inventory pipeline is severely distorted by 'phantom' in-transit units that are confirmed lost but still counted by the OR backend. Specifically, orders from Period 1 (37), Period 3 (84), Period 4 (38), and now Period 24 (216) are clearly lost (P24 is 5 periods overdue), totaling 375 phantom units. There are also smaller orders from P13 (79) and P29 (58) currently in the system. The total In-transit is reported as 680. If 375 are lost, 'actual' in-transit is closer to 305. To force the OR engine to order enough to meet demand despite the 375-unit 'ghost' inventory, I must explicitly set mu_hat to approximately (1+L) * Forecast + Lost units. With L=2 and Forecast=70, the requirement is ~210 + 375 = 585 units. Setting mu_hat to 580 to ensure the policy places an order to replenish the zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit units increased to 375 (P1, P3, P4, P24) as of Period 30. Demand regime is stable at ~70 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has shifted into a late-summer/pre-autumn regime, with the last 5 periods showing a mean of approximately 95 units (ranging from 46 to 136). The most critical issue is the persistent pipeline inventory distortion. There are 375 'phantom' units in-transit: P1 (37), P3 (84), P4 (38), and P24 (216) are confirmed or highly likely lost, yet they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (totaling 680). Because the OR engine caps orders at (Base Stock - Pipeline), these 375 phantom units prevent necessary ordering. To circumvent this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required target inventory (Base Stock) for a 2-period lead time (L+1 = 3 periods of coverage) based on the current mean demand of ~95. Target = 95 * 3 = 285. However, since the engine will subtract the 680 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when compared against 680, still triggers an order. To maintain a safety buffer and account for the 375 lost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 500. This ensures the engine recognizes a need for replenishment despite the bloated in-transit figure.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has shifted into a post-summer regime, averaging approximately 128 units over the last three periods (P29-P31). Total 'In-transit' stock is listed as 680 units, but significant pipeline distortion exists. Based on historical data, shipments from P1 (37), P3 (84), P4 (38), and P24 (216) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 375 phantom units. Furthermore, orders from P29 (58 units) are now overdue (P29 order + 2 periods = P31 conclude). Adding P29 to the lost list brings the total phantom inventory to 433 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 680 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 433 phantom units to ensure a real order is placed. The target inventory for (L+1) = 3 periods at ~128 units/period is ~384 units. To overcome the 680-unit pipeline count, I will set mu_hat significantly higher to ensure the engine triggers an replenishment order to fulfill actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit units increased to 433 (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) as of Period 32. Current demand regime stabilized around 128 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a post-summer plateau, averaging approximately 120 units over the last 4 periods (116, 136, 134, 109). A significant pipeline distortion exists: orders from P1, P3, P4, P24, and P29 (totaling 433 units) are confirmed lost as they have exceeded their lead times significantly without arriving. The 'In-transit' count of 1060 units includes these 433 phantom units and the P32 order of 380 units. To allow the OR engine to place an order, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the 'In-transit' count minus phantom units. With demand around 120/period and L=2, expected demand for (L+1) is 360 units. However, the backend's capped policy uses current In-transit (1060) in its calculation. To trigger an order that covers our actual needs while bypasssing the 433 phantom units, I will explicitly set mu_hat to 1420. This value is calculated as: (Actual needed base stock for 3 periods ~360) + (Phantom units 433) + (A buffer to counteract the inventory cap) = 1420. This ensures the engine recognizes the need for stock despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late September/early October period. Historically, demand for this 'Everyday Basic' V-neck has seen relative stability with some volatility (109 to 160 in the last two weeks). The most significant issue remains the pipeline inventory distortion. There are 433 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) that are effectively lost but still count towards the 'In-transit' total, causing the OR engine to under-order or stop ordering entirely due to the cap. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set explicitly to a value that covers the expected demand plus the phantom inventory (approximately 130 demand * 3 periods + 433 phantom units = 823). However, the system is already showing 1460 in-transit, which includes the very large orders from P32 (380) and P33 (400). I will use explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend recognizes the need for stock despite the high in-transit number. I set L=2 as it is the most common successful lead time. Given the high volatility and current zero on-hand status, mu_hat is set to 900 to ensure we capture the current demand regime (avg ~130-140) while overriding the pipeline cap.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 34, phantom (lost) in-transit units remain at 433 (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29). Recent demand regime (P29-P33) has shifted slightly higher, averaging ~131 units/period compared to the previous ~70.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162002 is a women's T-shirt, and demand has transitioned from a summer peak to a stable autumn regime, averaging approximately 122 units/period over the last 6 weeks (P29-P34). A critical issue remains: a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (1460 units) consists of lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (37), P3 (84), P4 (38), P24 (216), and P29 (58) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 433 phantom units. Furthermore, no new units have arrived since Period 27, despite orders in P32 (380) and P33 (400) having a promised lead time of 2 periods. While the P32 order might arrive during P35, the current on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the massive 'In-transit' count (which includes 433 lost units and possibly delayed P32/P33 orders), I must set an explicit mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the expected demand for the (L+1) window (3 periods * 122 avg = 366) PLUS the 433 lost units to bypass the inventory cap. Total mu_hat = 366 + 433 = 799. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) in-transit units remain at 433 (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29). Demand regime has stabilized at an average of ~122 units/period (P29-P34). Overdue shipments from P32 and P33 are being monitored; if they do not arrive by P36 START, the supply chain reliability is further degraded.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 14, 2019. In Period 35, the large order from Period 32 (380 units) arrived after a 3-period lead time, finally providing on-hand inventory (337 units). However, the order from Period 33 (400 units) is now overdue (3 periods passed without arrival), following the pattern of phantom/lost shipments. The total 'In-transit' figure of 1080 likely includes 833 phantom units (P1: 37, P3: 84, P4: 38, P24: 216, P29: 58, P33: 400). Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (70 and 43), suggesting the end of the late-summer surge and a transition into a lower autumn regime. To ensure the OR engine orders despite the massive phantom 'In-transit' volume, I must set an explicit mu_hat that overcomes the inventory cap. With ~833 phantom units, and an expected demand of ~100/week (300 for L+1), I set mu_hat to 1200. This 1200 - 1080 (in-transit) allows for a target base stock that accommodates actual demand while neutralizing the phantom inventory signal.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total phantom in-transit units estimated at 833 (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29, P33) as P33 is now 1 period past promised lead time. Autumn demand regime shift detected: demand dropped from ~130 to ~56 average over the last 2 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. We have entered an autumn demand regime where the last three periods (P34-P36) show a significant drop to 70, 43, and 58 units respectively (average ~57). The previous regime averaged ~130. On-hand inventory is healthy at 679 units. Regarding the pipeline, total in-transit is 680 units, but my analysis confirms that 833 units are permanently lost (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29, and P33). Wait, P33 just arrived in P36, so let's re-calculate: Lost units are P1(37), P3(84), P4(38), P24(216), and P29(58), totaling 433 phantom units. The current 'In-transit' of 680 units minus these 433 phantom units leaves an actual pipeline of 247 units (likely the P32/P33 arrivals logic). However, with 679 units on hand and demand at ~57/week, we have over 10 weeks of stock. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering in the future due to the 433 phantom units it sees as 'live' inventory, I will maintain an explicit mu_hat that reflects the current demand while slightly inflating it if needed to offset the phantom inventory. Given the high on-hand, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average (~57 * (2+1) = 171) to avoid further accumulation.

Carry-over insight: P33 order (400 units) arrived in Period 36 (Lead time = 3). Total phantom (lost) units in 'In-transit' revised to 433 (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29). Autumn demand regime confirmed: avg 57 units/period (P34-P36) vs previous ~122.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt' has settled into an autumn regime, averaging 58.75 units over the last 4 periods (P34-P37). On-hand inventory is high at 615 units following the arrival of P32 and P33 orders. The 'In-transit' count of 680 units is heavily distorted by 433 phantom (lost) units from P1, P3, P4, P24, and P29. While P32 and P33 arrived with a lead time of 3, the current stock levels (615 on-hand) are sufficient to cover over 10 weeks of current demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the lower autumn demand (~59/week) to prevent excessive holding costs, while maintaining the explicit mu_hat inflation technique (+433) to neutralize the OR engine's 'In-transit' bias. Given the high on-hand stock relative to demand, L is set to 'calculate' (avg ~2.1) as there is no immediate pressure to order.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the demand has entered a stable, low-volume autumn regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 55 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 573 units, and there are 680 units listed as in-transit. However, 433 of those in-transit units (from P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. This leaves 247 legitimate units in-transit (ordered in P32/P33, though history shows those actually arrived in P35/P36, so the in-transit field of 680 likely includes the 433 phantom units and potentially some other discrepancies). Regardless, the current on-hand inventory of 573 units is more than enough to cover the forecasted demand (~55 units/period) for the remainder of the game (9 periods left). To prevent excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower autumn demand. No new orders are expected or needed.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162002 is currently in an autumn low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is approximately 50.7 units/period, showing a significant drop from the spring/summer peaks. Inventory management is complicated by 'phantom' in-transit inventory: 433 units (from P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) are confirmed lost but still occupy the pipeline in the OR engine's logic. Current on-hand inventory is 546 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 10 periods. The goal is to avoid ordering while the on-hand stock is more than sufficient. To ensure the OR engine does not trigger an order despite the 433 phantom units and 546 on-hand units, I will set mu_hat to a low value reflecting the current autumn demand and allow the high on-hand stock to satisfy demand while it slowly depletes.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed stable at ~51 units/period (P34-P39). Supply chain remains distorted by 433 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) that will never arrive but remain in 'In-transit'.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, late autumn. Demand has settled into a stable low-volume regime following the summer peak. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 48.4 units per period (70, 43, 58, 64, 42, 27, 35). On-hand inventory is currently high at 511 units, which covers approximately 10 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' count of 680 includes 433 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) that are confirmed lost. Even after subtracting these, the actual pipeline + on-hand is more than sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable low-demand regime. This will prevent unnecessary ordering while the system works through existing overstock. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' to account for recent 3-period arrivals despite the promised 2.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has consistently stayed in the low autumn regime, with the last 8 periods (P34-P41) averaging 45.6 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 485 units, which is more than enough to cover over 10 periods of current demand. The pipeline still contains 680 'in-transit' units, but we know 433 of these (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) are phantom/lost units. Additionally, the Period 5 order (188 units) was supposedly delivered in Period 6 (confirmed by P6 conclude), but looking at the 'In-transit' count of 680 vs. known phantom units, there is a large amount of 'stuck' inventory in the system records (433 known phantom + 247 more likely from older failed tracking). Given the high on-hand stock and low demand, no new orders are needed. L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set based on the recent N = 8 regime to ensure the OR engine recognizes the current low-demand environment and the existing surplus, preventing unnecessary ordering.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn demand regime (P34-P41) stable at ~46 units/period. Pipeline distortion remains significant with at least 433 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) contributing to an inflated 'In-transit' count.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in a stable post-autumn/early-winter demand regime. Analysis of the last 9 periods (P34-P42) shows an average demand of approximately 47 units/period. On-hand inventory is 425 units, which is significantly higher than current demand levels, covering roughly 9 periods of demand. This high stock level is a result of large arrivals in P35 and P36 combined with the seasonal demand drop. The 'In-transit' count of 680 is heavily distorted by 433 confirmed phantom units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P24, P29 that will never arrive). Even accounting for these, the existing on-hand stock is sufficient to prevent stockouts for the remainder of the game (ending at Period 47) given the current low demand. To ensure the OR backend does not place unnecessary orders due to the phantom inventory and the natural stock position, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent stable regime (N=9) and maintain lead time at default. No new orders are needed; the current inventory is already incurring holding costs that outweigh the risk of stockout.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019 (Period 44). We are in a stable late-autumn/winter low-demand regime for basic T-shirts. Over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), demand has averaged 44 units/period, with the most recent sample at 15. On-hand inventory is 410 units, which covers over 9 periods of demand at current rates. The 'In-transit' count of 680 is heavily distorted by 433 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) that are confirmed lost across multiple months. Additionally, a shipment from P29 (58 units) is extremely overdue (15 periods) and also lost. Even accounting for these losses, the 410 units on-hand are sufficient to meet demand through the end of the game (Period 47). No further orders are required. To prevent the OR engine from ordering due to the 'In-transit' cap being hit by phantom units, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to reflect the current low-demand regime, and no corrective inflation is needed because on-hand stock is already excessive.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Final confirmation of total phantom units in 'In-transit' reaching 491 (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29, P29). Demand regime stable at ~44 units/period for the winter season.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019 (Period 45). We are in a stable winter demand regime for basic V-neck T-shirts, with demand averaging approximately 33 units/period over the last 5 weeks (Periods 40-44). The inventory position is heavily impacted by 'phantom' in-transit units. As documented in the carry-over insights, orders from P1, P3, P4, P24, P29, and another P29 duplicate (totaling 491 units) are confirmed lost but still occupy the pipeline in the OR engine's view. My current on-hand inventory is 387 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game (total expected demand ~100 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the inventory surplus, the goal is to prevent any further ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat (covering the post-autumn regime since Period 34) which produces a low forecast, and 'default' for other parameters. The high on-hand inventory plus the phantom in-transit units will naturally result in zero new orders from the OR backend.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 728162002 is in a low-demand winter regime, with current demand averaging approximately 27 units/period over the last 5 periods (P41-P45). The on-hand inventory is 370 units, which at the current burn rate, provides over 13 periods of coverage. There is a significant pipeline distortion: the 'In-transit' count of 680 reflects multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29) totaling 491 units, plus recent orders that may also be compromised or simply unnecessary given the surplus. Because the OR engine uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (final order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), and the in-transit count is heavily inflated by units that will never arrive, the engine will naturally output 0 as long as on_hand + in_transit > base_stock. Given the surplus of 370 on-hand units versus a weekly demand of ~27, no new orders are needed for the final periods. I will set mu_hat to a conservative level based on the recent regime and allow the existing stock to clear to minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (P41-P45) is stable at ~27 units/period. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' reach 491 (P1, P3, P4, P24, P29, P29).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (Period 47) of the 2019 calendar. The product is a basic V-neck T-shirt, which has seen several seasonal demand regimes: a spring peak (~250-300 units), a post-peak plateau (~135), a summer peak (~200), and a steady decline through autumn and winter. The current demand regime (P41-P46) has stabilized at a very low winter level, averaging 26.2 units per period (last 5 periods: 26, 60, 15, 23, 17, 16). On-hand inventory is currently 354 units, which is more than ten times the current weekly demand. Given that this is the final period of the simulation, there is no value in placing an order; any units ordered now would arrive after the simulation ends, incurring unnecessary costs or simply not being counted in the final reward calculation. The 'In-transit' count of 680 is heavily distorted by 491 phantom units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P24, P29, P29) and possibly other unarrived units from later periods. Since on-hand inventory (354) far exceeds any possible demand for the final period (approx 20-30 units), the goal is to stop ordering and minimize holding costs.
