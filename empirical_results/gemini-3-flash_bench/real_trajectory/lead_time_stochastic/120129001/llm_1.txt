There is no obvious seasonal spike for February based on the product description, but demand is relatively consistent. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive in Period 3 (L=2) and be available for demand in Period 3. To cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (total 3 periods) with some safety stock, I need to account for the pipeline. Average demand is 66/period. 66 * 3 = 198 units. I will order 210 units to establish initial stock and provide a small buffer for variance, as there is currently zero stock available for the current and upcoming periods.",

Calculated target for L+1 (3 periods) is ~225-240 units plus a high safety stock buffer due to unreliability.
