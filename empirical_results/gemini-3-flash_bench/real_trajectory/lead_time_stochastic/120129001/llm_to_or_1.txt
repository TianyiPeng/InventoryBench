Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 120129001, which is a maternity jersey legging ('Mama' category). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 65.8 units (73, 48, 65, 94, 49). There is no strong seasonal trend immediately apparent from the January-February transition, though 'Mama' leggings typically have stable year-round demand with slight peaks. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current review period (total 3 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the recent mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a target inventory level that accounts for the observed demand variability (StDev \u2248 18.7) while targetting the optimal service level based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is maternity leggings ('Mama'). Current on-hand is 0, with 98 units in-transit from Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks prior to the game was [73, 48, 65, 94, 49] (mean: 65.8). Period 1 actual demand was 63, which is consistent with the historical mean. Since the promised lead time is 2, the order placed in Period 1 (98 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Therefore, we face a stockout in Period 2. Using N=6 (5 history + P1) for demand estimation. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is maternity leggings ('Mama' jersey fancy). Historical demand (Jan-early Feb) averaged 65.8 units/period. Over the last two periods (P1 and P2), demand was 63 and 88, showing a slight upward trend. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Orders placed in P1 (98 units) and P2 (94 units) are in transit. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (visible in P4 start). Since demand is currently 0 due to stockouts, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1) horizon. I will use the average of all samples (historical + P1, P2) which is (73+48+65+94+49+63+88)/7 = 68.57 to set the forecast. L is set to default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/04. The product is Mama leggings, which usually sees stable demand. Historical demand samples (last 5) are 73, 48, 65, 94, 49 (avg ~66). Game history shows demand of 63, 88, and 84 (avg ~78). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have sold 0 units so far because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2. The Period 1 order (98 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4, but the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests a lead time delay or potential loss. However, per rules, the first confirmation of a P1 arrival (L=2) would only appear in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Since it shows 0, the lead time is at least 3 periods. I will adjust L to 3 to cover the uncertainty and use recent_N=3 for demand (avg 78.3) to reflect the slightly higher recent demand compared to the initial 5 samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is maternity leggings (Mama/Jersey Fancy), a relatively stable demand item. Current date is March 11. Historical demand (5 seed samples + 4 game samples) shows values: 73, 48, 65, 94, 49 (seed) and 63, 88, 84, 76 (game). The mean demand is approximately 71 units per period with no significant trend or seasonal spike detected yet. Current on-hand is low (18 units) due to the zero-inventory start and initial lead time gap. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). I have 239 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4), which covers the pipeline. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the most relevant recent variability (88, 84, 76 from game plus last 2 seeds: 94, 49).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Demand history shows samples: 73, 48, 65, 94, 49 (pre-game) and 63, 88, 84, 76, 85 (in-game). The mean demand is approximately 72.5 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P1 (98), P3 (40), and P4 (101). The order from P2 (94) arrived in P4 (L=2). The P1 order is now significantly overdue (placed P1, promised L=2, expected arrival P3, confirmation in P4 start). Since it is now P6 and P1's order has not arrived, I must assume it is lost. The P3 order is expected to arrive during P5 and show in P6 conclude, but we haven't seen the P5 conclude message yet (we only see up to P5 end, and P3 should have arrived during P5). However, P5 conclude says arrived=0, meaning the P3 order (L=2) is also missing or delayed. Given this instability and the stockout (on-hand=0), I will use an explicit L=2 but set mu_hat to cover $1+L = 3$ periods of demand. Mean demand is ~73, so $3 * 73 = 219$. Since we are out of stock and have lost orders, I will set a higher sigma_hat explicitly to increase the base stock and trigger an order to replenish, as the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory. Pipeline (239) includes the likely lost P1 (98) and P3 (40) orders. To ensure the OR engine orders more than zero, I need base_stock > pipeline. I'll set mu_hat to 350 to provide a buffer against the 'ghost' pipeline units.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Babette long' maternity leggings. Current date is March 25, moving into early Spring. On-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. History review: Period 4 arrived an order from Period 2 (L=2). The order from Period 1 (98 units) should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2, or Period 4 if L=3, but it hasn't appeared in any 'conclude' message yet and is likely lost. The Period 3 order (40 units) was due in Period 5 and is also likely lost. The pipeline includes Period 4 order (101), Period 6 (135), and an as-yet-unaccounted Period 7 order. However, since P1 and P3 orders did not arrive, I am treating them as vanished. Total in-transit according to the system is 374 (98+94+40+101+0+135 + P7? No, 98+94+40+101+135=468, but 94 arrived, leaving 374). The 98 (P1) and 40 (P3) units are likely lost. Excluding them, valid in-transit is 101 (P4) + 135 (P6) = 236. Lead time seems to be a stable 2 periods for successful shipments. Demand is stable: samples (73, 48, 65, 94, 49) and history (63, 88, 84, 76, 85, 82). Mean is ~73. I will use N=6 for demand parameters to reflect the recent slightly higher stability.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (98 units) and Period 3 (40 units) are overdue and potentially lost; lead time for arriving orders is confirmed at 2 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is maternal leggings, which likely see stable demand, though current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows significant logistical disruption: orders from Period 1 (98 units) and Period 3 (40 units) are now 5-7 periods old and have not arrived, suggesting they are lost. The only successful arrival was from Period 2 with a lead time of 2. The pipeline inventory of 374 units includes these likely lost shipments (138 units) plus valid orders from Period 4 (101 units), Period 6 (135 units), and Period 8. In-transit units from P4 are now at the expected 2-period limit (visibility in P5 START), but no 'conclude' message has appeared, indicating potential ongoing delays or losses. Demand has stabilized around an average of 76 units across the last 7 periods (63, 88, 84, 76, 85, 82, 54). To compensate for the 0 on-hand stock and the high probability that earlier 138 units are lost, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the most recent demand regime) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for current needs, while keeping L at default (2) as the recorded arrivals adhered to this value.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P1 (98) and P3 (40) are confirmed lost (missing for 5+ periods). Lead time for the only arrival recorded was 2 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing 'Babette long' maternity leggings. The current demand exhibits relative stability with recent samples (85, 82, 54, 94). Observation from Period 8 confirm that orders from Period 6 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, while orders from Period 1 and Period 3 are definitively lost, as they haven't arrived after 7 and 5 periods respectively. The current on-hand inventory is 41 with 239 units in-transit (orders from Period 4 and potentially beyond if any were placed, though history shows ordered=0 for Periods 7 and 8). Given the promised lead time (L=2) is consistent with the latest arrival, I will use L=2. Demand over the L+1 window (3 periods) is calculated based on recent history to capture the current mean of ~79 units/period. The OR engine will subtract the 'pipeline' (in-transit) from its base stock calculation; since the backend assumes all in-transit units will arrive, and we've confirmed P1 and P3 are lost, the actual pipeline to the backend (239) is lower than the sum of all 'ordered' values, correctly excluding those lost units. We use recent_N=5 to capture current demand levels.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/15. The product is a maternity legging (Mama Jersey Fancy), which likely has stable year-round appeal but may see minor shifts. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 239 units. Analysis of arrivals shows that orders from Period 2 and Period 6 arrived exactly 2 periods later (promised L=2). However, orders from P1 (98 units), P3 (40 units), and P4 (101 units) are missing and past the confirmed 2-period lead time. P1 and P3 are definitively lost. P4 (ordered March 4) is now 6 periods overdue and should also be considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0 (as all 239 units currently in-transit originate from older, failed/lost shipments, or the backend has not updated the in-transit field to reflect these losses yet). Demand has averaged 76.2 units over the 9 periods (samples: 63, 88, 84, 76, 85, 82, 54, 94, 57). Recently, demand has fluctuated but remains near the historical average. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean (~74 units) and set L to 'default' (2) as the physical arrivals we did see adhered to the promised lead time. Using an L=2 and recent_N for mu and sigma will force the OR engine to order enough to cover the persistent stockouts caused by multiple lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 4 (101 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, following the pattern of P1 and P3.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a staple item (maternity leggings) with relatively stable demand. Analysis of historical data (15 samples) shows mean demand is approximately 73 units per week. Although demand in the last two weeks was slightly lower (57, 51), Period 8 saw a peak of 94, suggesting we should not overreact to a short-term dip. Significant reliability issues exist: orders from Period 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost (missed for 5+ periods). However, arriving orders (P2 and P6) consistently show an actual lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity is 250, but cross-referencing history suggests much of this is 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1: 98, P3: 40, P4: 101 = 239 units); only the order from Period 10 (11 units) is likely active. To compensate for the high risk of lost shipments and the current stockout, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the full sample history to ensure a robust base stock that accounts for the volatility observed across the last 15 periods. We maintain L=2 as the physical arrival speed remains consistent for orders that are not lost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019-04-29). The product is maternity leggings ('Mama' jersey leggings). Historical demand shows a consistent range between 48 and 94 units per period. The recent mean demand (Periods 1-11) is approximately 72 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 250 units, but this includes lost shipments from Period 1 (98), Period 3 (40), and Period 4 (101), totaling 239 units that will never arrive. The only valid in-transit order is from Period 10 (11 units). Since the promised lead time is 2, the P10 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 12. Although the lead time of 2 is confirmed by arrivals in P4 and P8, the frequent loss of shipments (P1, P3, P4) is a critical issue. Since the OR backend handles 'in-transit' mathematically by subtracting it from the base stock, and the pipeline inventory is currently inflated by 239 phantom units, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend places a corrective order. I estimate the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. With mean demand ~72, suggested base stock is around 216-250 units. If I let the backend see in-transit=250, it won't order. By setting an explicit high mu_hat (or L), I can force an order to replenish against the lost stock.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 120129001 (Babette long leggings) shows a consistent demand profile with a mean of ~71 units per period across the history (51-94 range). Lead time is consistently 2 periods when orders actually arrive (P2 and P6). However, there is a severe reliability issue with lost shipments: orders from P1, P3, and P4 have never arrived and are long overdue, confirming a significant loss rate. Current status is 0 on-hand inventory with 426 units in-transit. The OR backend subtracts in-transit from the base stock to decide the order. Since P1, P3, and P4 orders (98+40+101 = 239 units) are almost certainly lost, the in-transit field is overstating available supply. To compensate and ensure we get stock, I will set mu_hat to a high 'explicit' value to force an order that accounts for the fact that ~239 units of the pipeline should be considered void, effectively resetting the inventory position to cover the next (L+1) periods of demand despite the 'phantom' in-transit units. Demand is stable, so I use the recent 12-period average (71 units) times (1+L) as the baseline for mu_hat, but inflated to bypass the lost-item pipeline error.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13). The product is maternity leggings ('Mama Leggings'), which typically shows stable demand but is currently experiencing severe stockouts due to unreliable logistics. History shows shipments from P1, P3, and P4 were lost. Although the promised lead time (L) is 2, and confirmed arrivals (from P2 and P6) arrived in 2 periods, the 'In-transit' quantity of 473 units includes those lost orders (98+40+101=239) and recent orders (P10: 11, P12: 176, P13: 47). These 239 units should be considered permanent losses. For Period 14, we expect the order from Period 12 (176 units) to arrive during this period (since P12+2=P14). Current on-hand is 0. Demand has averaged 72.8 units over the last 5 periods. I will use a recent_N of 13 to capture the full active history since P1 (excluding baseline samples) for demand forecasting. To compensate for the high risk of lost shipments and the current 0 on-hand status, I will use lead time L=2 and set parameters to ensure we rebuild stock if the P12 order arrives safely.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20), we are managing organic maternity leggings. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 63-68 units over the last 5 periods (P10-P14). The order from Period 12 (176 units) arrived in Period 14 (lead time 2), confirming the promised lead time remains accurate for successful deliveries. Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 remain lost. Currently, we have 110 units on hand and 297 in transit (P1: 98, P3: 40, P4: 101, P10: 11, P13: 47). Since P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost, they should be excluded from pipeline integrity. Effective in-transit is only P10 (11) and P13 (47), totaling 58. With demand averaging ~67 over the last 5 periods and lead time L=2, required stock is roughly (L+1)*Avg = 3*67 = 201 units. Current 'useful' inventory (110 on-hand + 58 effective in-transit) = 168. The OR engine needs to order more, but it sees 297 in-transit. By using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand, I capture the latest stable demand regime. I maintain L=default as 2 is reliable for recent deliveries. Sigma is set to default to cover general volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. The product is maternity leggings (Mama/Jersey/Organic). Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaging 66.4 units (63, 68, 68, 66, 67). Shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost, as their (L+1) window has long passed without arrival. Successful arrivals (P4, P8, P14) all adhered to the promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 43 units. The in-transit inventory is 297 units, but this includes the confirmed lost orders (P1: 98, P3: 40, P4: 101), totaling 239 units that will never arrive. The actual viable pipeline consists of orders from P10 (11 units) and P13 (47 units), totaling 58 units. The order from P10 is overdue (ordered 6 periods ago), but P13 is still within the expected delivery window for P16/P17. Because of the heavy pipeline inflation from 'ghost' shipments, I will use recent_N to forecast demand based on the stable period (N=5) and stick with lead time L=2. The OR engine will subtract the 'ghost' pipeline from the target stock, likely preventing necessary orders unless mu_hat is slightly adjusted to compensate for current low on-hand status (43) versus avg demand (66).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), it is late spring/early summer. The product is maternity leggings (Mama/Jersey Fancy), a staple category with relatively stable demand (historical mean around 68-70 units). In-transit inventory is 297 units, comprised of orders from P10 (11 - likely lost), P13 (47 - overdue, likely lost), with the rest being newer or pipeline buildup from the OR logic. Recent demand has stabilized: last 5 periods show 68, 68, 66, 67, 46 (mean ~63). However, we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Lead time is consistently 2 periods when orders arrive, but we have a severe issue with lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and potentially P10/P13). Since the OR engine is unaware of lost shipments, 'pipeline_inventory' in its view is 297, which will prevent it from ordering. To force an order despite these 'ghost' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a high base stock targets. I'll use L=2 (confirmed lead time), mu_hat calculation based on the stable period mean (63 * 3 = 189) plus an aggressive buffer to overcome the 297 phantom in-transit units. Setting mu_hat to 400 and sigma_hat higher to reflect volatility caused by shipment reliability issues.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 10 (11 units) and Period 13 (47 units) are now 7 and 4 periods overdue respectively, following the established pattern of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4). Total suspected lost units in 'In-transit' sync: 11+47 + (previous confirmed) = significant portion of the 297 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), the product (Maternity Leggings) shows stable demand averaging 67 units over the last 5 periods. The primary challenge remains chronic shipment loss. Orders from Periods 1(98), 3(40), 4(101), 10(11), and 13(47) are now considered lost based on the 7+ period delay threshold. Total lost units in the current 501-unit 'In-transit' pipeline = 297 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (final_order = base_stock - pipeline), so if 'pipeline' is inflated by ghost units, it will under-order. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to a high 'explicit' value that incorporates both the 3-period demand (L=2 + review period) AND the 297 units of 'missing' inventory to force the OR engine to place an order. Forecasted demand is ~65/week. Required inventory for 3 weeks = 195. To offset the 297 ghost units, mu_hat should target approximately 195 + 297 = 492 units. L is set to 'default' as arriving shipments (P2, P6, P12) consistently show a lead time of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss persists: 297 units across P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 are confirmed lost; In-transit count is critically inflated, requiring mu_hat adjustment to maintain stock levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity legging ('Mama' category), which typically shows stable year-round demand with minor fluctuations. Current demand (Period 18) is 58, and the average since Period 10 has stabilized around 60 units/period (mean of last 9 periods is 61). Inventory is currently 0, and the in-transit value of 511 is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1 (98), P3 (40), P4 (101), P10 (11), and P13 (47), totaling 297 lost units. Only 214 units are actually expected (P17: 204, P18: 10). The P17 order (204 units) should arrive in Period 19. Because the OR backend subtracts the inflated 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 297 lost units. Target base stock = (L+1) * 61 = 183. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the phantom 297 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 183 + 297 = 480. This forces the system to recognize the need for inventory that the pipeline logic is currently ignoring due to lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 297 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) confirmed; mu_hat must be explicitly adjusted upward to compensate for the OR backend's pipeline subtraction of these non-existent units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 120129001 is a maternity legging with relatively stable demand (avg ~67 units/period). However, the inventory situation is critical due to systemic shipment losses. I have confirmed that 297 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13) are effectively lost, yet \u043e\u043d\u0438 remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 501. The OR backend uses the formula: order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). Because the pipeline is inflated by these 297 phantom units, the OR engine will under-order or not order at all, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at 67 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the desired coverage is (1+L)=3 periods of demand (approx 201 units). To force the backend to place an order despite the 297 phantom units in transit, I am setting mu_hat = 201 + 297 = 498. This 'lift' compensates for the pipeline subtraction. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P19) showed a short lead time of 1, but the promised is 2.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/1. Demand for this maternity legging remains relatively stable, with a recent mean around 55-60 units. However, we have a critical supply chain issue: systemic shipment loss. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' quantity from its base stock calculation. Currently, 'In-transit' is 512 units. Analysis of history confirms that 297 units (P1: 98, P3: 40, P4: 101, P10: 11, P13: 47) are lost and will never arrive. Additionally, the order from P17 (204 units) is now 3 periods old (placed P17, expected P19); since it hasn't arrived by P20 conclude, it is highly suspect but not yet confirmed 'lost' by my 5-period rule. To avoid the OR engine placing zero orders due to the 297 units of 'ghost' inventory, I must use mu_hat 'explicit' to inflate the base stock. Target base stock = (L+1)*AvgDemand + (Lost Units). Estimated (L+1)*AvgDemand = 3 * 60 = 180. Adding the 297 confirmed lost units = 477. I will set mu_hat to 480 to force the backend to place an order, while maintaining L=2 as the physical lead time is confirmed at 2 periods when orders actually arrive (P2, P6, P12). Sigma_hat is set to a standard level for this volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity legging (Mama | Jersey Fancy), which generally shows steady demand but has been experiencing severe supply chain issues. As of Period 22, the 'In-transit' figure is 512 units. Analysis of history confirms that several shipments are lost: P1 (98), P3 (40), P4 (101), P10 (11), and P13 (47), totaling 297 units. These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from its ordering logic. Additionally, the order from P17 (204 units) is now 5 periods old (exceeding the observed lead time of 2 periods) and is also potentially lost or significantly delayed. To get the OR backend to place an order when it sees 512 units in transit, I must explicitly set mu_hat to cover both actual demand (approx. 60 units/period) and the 'ghost' inventory. Forecast for (L+1) periods (3 periods) is 180 units. Adding the 297 lost units and the 204 delayed units (total 501) means mu_hat must be set around 681 to trigger any replenishment. I will set mu_hat to 700 to ensure we overcome the pipeline subtraction and maintain a safety stock for this organic cotton garment.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total increased to 501 units: P1(98), P3(40), P4(101), P10(11), P13(47) confirmed lost; P17(204) now 5 periods overdue and suspected lost. Pipeline inventory is almost entirely comprised of non-existent units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 (July 15). The item is organic cotton maternity leggings. Demand has stabilized recently between 30-50 units per week. The critical issue is systemic shipment loss: orders from P1 (98), P3 (40), P4 (101), P10 (11), P13 (47), and now likely P17 (204) are lost. These sum to 501 units. The 'In-transit' count is 710, meaning 501 of these units are ghost inventory that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (710) from the target base stock. To compel the OR engine to place an order despite this 'paper' surplus, I must explicitly set 'mu_hat' to a value that covers the expected demand (1+L periods) PLUS the lost units. Average weekly demand is ~50. Expected demand for 3 periods (L=2) is 150. Total mu_hat = 150 (demand) + 501 (lost units) = 651 units. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the order is triggered. For sigma_hat, I'll use the volatility from the last 10 periods of data.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total confirmed at 501 units: P1(98), P3(40), P4(101), P10(11), P13(47), and P17(204). Demand since P15 has hovered around 50 units/period. mu_hat needs explicit inflation to bypass ghost pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-44.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 176 units following the arrival of the P22 order (209 units). Recent demand (P20-P23) has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 38 units/period, down from the earlier 50-60 range. However, the 'In-transit' count of 501 units remains entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 501 units from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless \u03bc\u0302 is explicitly inflated to exceed the sum of (on-hand + 'ghost' pipeline). To ensure a healthy stock level covering 3 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate of ~40 units/period, the base stock should be around 120-150 units. With 176 currently on-hand and 501 fake pipeline units, \u03bc\u0302 must be set to at least 176 + 501 = 677 just to reach a net zero order position, and higher to actually trigger an order if needed. I am setting \u03bc\u0302 to 680 to acknowledge the lost inventory and maintain current levels, while setting \u03c3\u0302 based on recent volatility to prevent unnecessary over-ordering beyond the holding cost threshold.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity legging (Mama Jersey Fancy). Demand has stabilized around a lower mean recently, averaging approximately 37.8 units/period over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). The inventory system is severely compromised by 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 501 units across historical periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) are effectively lost but still count towards 'In-transit' (517 units total). Current on-hand is 139. The OR backend uses the logic: 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)'. Because in_transit is 517 and on_hand is 139, the backend sees a total of 656 units, which far exceeds any reasonable base_stock for a 40-unit/period demand. This results in the backend ordering 0 units unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to exceed the phantom inventory. I need to maintain a safety stock of ~150 units (approx 3-4 periods of demand). To force the backend to place a maintenance order, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 656 phantom+on-hand units. However, since we currently have 139 units on hand (covering ~3.5 periods), we don't need a large order immediately. I will set mu_hat to cover current demand patterns (L=2, mu ~ 114) but continue to monitor for when the on-hand drops significantly enough to require overcoming the 501-unit ghost inventory gap.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity legging (Mama Jersey Fancy). Demand has shifted downwards from an early mean of ~75 units/period to a more recent mean of ~42 units over the last 10 periods (since P16). We are currently in early August (Period 26), which typically precedes a stable late-summer demand phase for this category. In-transit is significantly inflated (517 units) due to confirmed lost shipments: P1(98), P3(40), P4(101), P10(11), P13(47), and P17(204), totaling 501 'ghost' units. The OR backend subtracts this pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, which would prevent necessary ordering. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. L=2 (promised/observed), Forecast=42, so mu_hat = (1+2)*42 + 501 = 627. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) provides a responsive volatility measure for the current lower-demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a maternity legging (Mama Jersey Fancy). Demand has stabilized around a lower mean of 37 units/period over the last 7 periods (P20-P26), down from the earlier average of ~65. Lead times fluctuate between 1-2 periods. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' count of 539 units, which includes 501 confirmed lost units (P1: 98, P3: 40, P4: 101, P10: 11, P13: 47, P17: 204). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit pipeline (539) from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to bypass this 'ghost' inventory. To ensure the backend targets an actual stock level of ~150 units (approx. 4 weeks of demand at 37/week) while ignoring the 501 lost units, I must set mu_hat = ~650 (500 + 150). Setting L=2 as the baseline lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total remains at 501 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17). Recent demand (P20-P26) has stabilized at a lower mean of 37.3 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Mama' leggings, which should have stable demand. As of Period 28 (mid-August), demand has spiked to 68 units, returning to historical averages after a lower-demand period in July. The core problem remains systemic shipment loss: 501 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (599 units). Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory, the OR backend sees 599 units in-transit and will order nothing unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to exceed this phantom pipeline. Recent demand (P20-P27) averaged 42 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the 501 ghost units plus cover (L+1)=3 periods of actual demand (3 * 55 = 165). Thus, mu_hat = 501 + 165 = 666. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 analysis: We are facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. The product is 'Mama' leggings, which generally have stable year-round demand but can experience volatility. The current pipeline inventory (685 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Confirmed lost orders are: P1 (98), P3 (40), P4 (101), P10 (11), P13 (47), and P17 (204), totaling 501 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 184 units (685 - 501), comprised of orders from P24 (16), P26 (22), P27 (60), and P28 (86). Demand has recently shifted again: after a low period (P20-P25 avg ~37), the last three periods (P26-P28) averaged 53.7 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 'ghost' inventory of 501 units, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Target base stock = (Effective Mean Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units + Safety Stock. Using a conservative mean of 50 units/period and L=2: Base Stock = (50 * 3) + 501 + Safety Stock (~30) \u2248 681. Setting mu_hat to 681 ensures the final order (Base Stock - 685) accounts for the lost items and recent demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand increased from ~37 (P20-P25) to ~54 (P26-P28). Sustained lost shipping volume remains at 501 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '120129001' (Mama Leggings) is in Period 30. Recent demand (P26-P29) has averaged 51.75 units/period (44, 68, 49, 46), confirming the regime shift noted in the previous period. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline: 501 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17 are confirmed lost. The current In-transit total of 701 reflects these 501 lost units plus 200 legitimate units (ordered P24, P26, P27, P28, P29). Since on-hand is 0, the OR backend sees 701 units in the pipeline and will not order unless mu_hat exceeds that number. To compel an order that covers (~3 periods) of actual demand at the current rate of ~52/period, I must set mu_hat to 'ghost units + (L+1)*current_demand'. Calculation: 501 + (3 * 52) = 657. Setting mu_hat to 660 via 'explicit' method to bypass the pipeline subtraction. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (sqrt(3)*26) to maintain a buffer around the expected 52/period demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we observe three key factors: (1) Systemic Shipment Loss: 501 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) are permanently lost. However, the OR backend's 'In-transit' count is 555, which includes these 501 ghost units plus recent valid orders (P29: 16, P30: 0, and others). (2) Demand Regime: Demand has spiked recently (P30: 95) after a period of lower demand. The mean of the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 60.4 units. (3) Inventory: On-hand is 51. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (555) from the base stock target, it will not order anything unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset the 501 ghost units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the new demand regime (mean ~60/period) over (L+1) = 3 periods, the target base stock should be ~180 units. To produce an order of approximately 130 units (180 target - 51 on-hand), we must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 555' results in the desired volume. Using explicit mu_hat = 710 (555 pipeline + 180 target - 25 buffer) to force replenishment. L is set to 2 as the recent arrivals (P27, P28) arrived in 2-3 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 120129001 (Maternity Leggings) is exhibiting a seasonal demand surge likely associated with the 'Back to School' or autumn fashion transition, with recent demand jumping from ~50 units to 101 units in Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 691 units is highly misleading: 501 units are legacy lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) and 16 units from P29 are now overdue (L=3+), likely lost or significantly delayed. Legitimate pipeline is likely only the 136 units ordered in P31. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 691 units from the base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force an order. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the current high rate (~100/week) plus the gap created by 517+ 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 800. This ensures the backend sees (800 - 691) = ~109 units as the target, triggering a necessary replenishment. L is set to 3 to account for recent arrival delays (P27 arrived in 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P30-P31 avg demand is 98 units, up from P26-P29 avg of 52 units (+88%). Estimated total lost/invalid pipeline inventory now 517 units (legacy 501 + P29's 16 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P32) has spiked significantly, averaging 87 units/period compared to the previous regime (P26-P29) of 52 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average 87) to capture this surge. The 'In-transit' count is 707, but history confirms a major systemic issue with lost shipments: 517 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, and P29) are considered lost and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (707) from the base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed when 'Ghost Pipeline' (517) > 'Real Need', I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Actual Target Stock = (L+1) * 87 = 3 * 87 = 261. Effective On-hand = 71. Real Pipeline = 707 - 517 = 190. Required addition = 261 - (71 + 190) = 0. However, the backend sees: Order = BaseStock - 707. To get an order of ~X, BaseStock must be around 707 + 87. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 87 + 517 = 261 + 517 = 778 to neutralize the ghost inventory impact and maintain a service level for the 87 units/period demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is maternity leggings (Mama/Jersey Fancy). Current demand is in a high-volatility, high-volume regime. Period 33 demand was 114 units, and the average of the last 4 periods (P30-P33) is 93.75 units. In-transit inventory is 736 units, but history shows persistent shipment losses. Confirmed lost units: P1(98), P3(40), P4(101), P10(11), P13(47), P17(204), and P29(16), totaling 517 units. Additionally, the P32 order (152 units) is still in transit. Total valid pipeline inventory is likely only 181 units (P32's 152 + P33's 29). The OR backend subtracts the full 736 units from its base stock calculation. To counteract this 'ghost' inventory of 517 units and maintain a target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 3 * 94 = 282 units), mu_hat must be explicitly set. I will set mu_hat = 282 (target stock) + 517 (ghost inventory) = 799 units. This ensures the backend places an order despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma is set based on recent high volatility (std dev of ~22 for the last 4 periods, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: P33 confirms sustained high demand (93.75 avg over P30-P33). Valid in-transit pipeline is estimated at 181 units, with the remaining 555 units (including P29's 16 and potentially older items) treated as lost/invalid for ordering decisions.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 35. Demand has entered a sustained high regime since Period 30, with an average of 91.4 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 95, 101, 65, 114, 82). The product is 'Mama' leggings, likely entering a peak seasonal demand period. Regarding lead times, the most recent arrivals (P30, P32) show a mix of 1-3 periods, averaging 2 periods. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' count of 831 units. Based on history, at least 555 units are confirmed or highly suspected lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, and likely P29). Valid pipeline consists of P32 (152), P33 (29), and P34 (95) = 276 units. To bypass the ghost inventory while accounting for the high demand (L+1 = 3 periods), mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to (3 * 91.4) + 555 = 829. This forces the OR engine (which subtracts the full 831 pipeline) to recognize approximately 274 units of demand protection, covering the next 3 periods at the current high rate (~91/period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 30: Average demand increased from ~50 to ~91.4 (+83%). Valid pipeline estimated at 276 units; legacy lost units (P1-P29) now total 555 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a maternity legging ('Mama' category), which typically sees steady demand but can experience shifts. Current Period is 36 (Oct 14). Since Period 30, demand has shifted significantly higher, averaging 88.5 units (P30-P35). The in-transit pipeline (705 units) is heavily distorted by legacy lost shipments. Confirmed lost units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17 total 501 units. Additionally, P29 (16 units) is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost. Total lost units = 517. The valid pipeline consists of orders from P33 (29), P34 (95), and P35 (26), totaling 150 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' (705) from the base stock. To ensure an order is placed to cover the new demand regime (approx 90 units/period) despite the 'ghost' inventory of 517 units, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Base stock should cover (L+1) periods, where L=2. Target base stock = 3 * 90 = 270 units. To offset the 517 lost units that the backend will subtract, I set mu_hat to 270 + 517 = 787. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the volatility of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total adjusted to 517 units: P1(98), P3(40), P4(101), P10(11), P13(47), P17(204), and P29(16) confirmed lost due to excessive lead time (>5 periods). Valid pipeline is only 150 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 120129001 (Mama leggings) has shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 30, though recent demand has slightly softened (73, 51). The average demand from P30-P36 is approximately 83 units/period. The lead time remains volatile, with recent arrivals showing 3 periods (P32, P33) and 1 period (P35). I will use a conservative lead time L=2 (promised), as calculating from such variance is risky. The 'In-transit' figure (680) is heavily corrupted by 517 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29). Valid pipeline = 680 - 517 = 163 units (comprising orders from P34 and P36). To bypass the OR backend's subtraction of the 517 ghost units, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Desired base stock for (L+1)=3 periods is ~3 * 83 = 249. To force the OR backend (which sees 680 in transit) to order appropriately, I calculate mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 680' results in the intended replenishment. However, the capped policy is likely to limit the order size. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand plus the lost inventory offset to ensure the on-hand stock is replenished to meet the ~83 unit weekly demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Mama Leggings' (120129001) has transitioned from a high-demand period in September (avg ~94 in P30-P33) to a more moderate level recently (P35-P37 avg ~64). Currently, on-hand inventory is 15 units. The primary challenge is the systemic inflation of the 'In-transit' figure due to historical lost shipments. Total confirmed lost shipments are 517 units: P1(98), P3(40), P4(101), P10(11), P13(47), P17(204), and P29(16). The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (715) from the base stock. The 'valid' pipeline is approximately 198 units (715 - 517), comprised of orders from P34 onwards. To calculate the necessary order, the mu_hat must be explicitly set to bypass this ghost inventory. Calculation: Target Base Stock (covering L+1=3 periods) should be around 64 * 3 = 192 units. To force the backend to order, mu_hat must exceed (Valid Pipeline + Lost Pipeline + On-hand). However, using the explicit method for mu_hat directly targets the total base stock before pipeline subtraction. I will set mu_hat to 720 to offset the 715 in-transit and 15 on-hand, ensuring we maintain a safety buffer as we move deeper into Q4.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the product shows steady demand around 60 units. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 831 units. Based on history, 517 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29). Subtracting these leaves a 'valid' pipeline of 314 units. These valid units are P34 (95 units), P36 (30 units), P38 (151 units), and others. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (831) from the base stock to calculate orders, it will likely order 0 until the pipeline clears. Since the pipeline won't clear (lost units remain indefinitely), I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) at approximately 180 units. To force an order despite the 517 phantom units in the pipeline, mu_hat is set to 700 (180 + 520) to ensure the backend generates an order covering current demand plus a safety margin, bypassing the logic-block caused by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29) remain at 517 units. In-transit inventory of 831 contains at least 517 phantom units, requiring continued explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is maternity leggings, currently transitioning through autumn into the holiday season. Recent demand (P30-P39) averages 80.3 units/period, significantly higher than the summer average. The actual lead time has been highly variable, recently oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P36 order arrived P39 - 3 periods; P37 order arrived P38 - 1 period). The core challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: out of 801 units reported in-transit, 517 units are definitively lost (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29). These 517 phantom units subtract from the OR engine's base-stock calculation, preventing necessary orders. To negate this, I am setting mu_hat using an 'explicit' value. Calculation: Total Base Stock needed = (Demand Forecast * (L+1)) + Lost Units. Using a forecast of 80 units/period and L=3 (to be safe given recent variability), Base Stock = 80 * 4 + 517 = 837. I will set mu_hat to 837. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current high-demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The primary challenge continues to be the significant volume of systemic lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29) totaling 517 units, which remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from our base stock target, so we must explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset these 517 phantom units. Demand has stabilized into a regime since Period 30, averaging approximately 78.4 units per period across the last 11 samples (P30-P40), with higher volatility. I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat to (1+L)*78.4 + 517 = 752.2, and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the current volatility correctly.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 120129001 is currently in a demand regime that emerged around Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 75.3 units. The 'In-transit' inventory of 873 units is significantly comprised of historical lost shipments from periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29) totaling 517 units that will never arrive. To account for this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the OR backend's logic, which would otherwise subtract these 517 units from the target base stock. The target base stock calculation incorporates the current demand regime mean (~75.3) over (L+1) periods (3 periods), plus a safety stock buffer based on the recent variance. At Period 42, we are nearing the end of the game (total 47 periods). The valid pipeline contains orders from P38 (151) and P40 (72), totaling 223 units. With 517 phantom units, the 'effective' pipeline is 356 units. I set mu_hat explicitly to ensure we place a replenishment order despite the high visible 'In-transit' figure.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in a high-demand period (Black Friday/Holiday season), evidenced by the Period 42 demand of 129 units. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 74.8, but the recent spike suggests we should prepare for higher volatility. A critical issue remains the 'In-transit' inventory of 873 units. Based on historical tracking, at least 517 units are definitely lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29). Furthermore, orders from P34 (95 units) and P38 (151 units) are now overdue (P34 by 9 periods, P38 by 5 periods), suggesting they are also likely lost or significantly delayed. Total suspected lost units: 517 + 95 + 151 = 763. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of approximately 110 units (P40's 72 units + P30's 16 units + noise). To force the OR backend to order despite the 873 'ghost' units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of high demand plus the invalid pipeline. Assuming L=2, (1+L)=3. High demand forecast = 100 units/period. Required inventory level ~ 300. Ghost inventory ~ 763. Calculation: 300 + 763 = 1063. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a positive order (1063 - 873 = 190).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Cumulative lost shipments increased to 763 units. Orders from P34 (95) and P38 (151) are now considered lost along with the previous 517 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29). Holiday demand surge confirmed with P42 reaching 129 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday season for leggings/tights. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 129, and although Period 43 was lower (43), we expect high volatility and potential surges as we approach the end of the year. The primary challenge is the corrupted 'In-transit' metric. Total in-transit is 1030, but based on history, 763 units are confirmed lost: P1(98), P3(40), P4(101), P10(11), P13(47), P17(204), P29(16), P34(95), and P38(151). This leaves only 267 valid units (P43's 229 and others). If we use standard mu_hat, the OR backend will subtract 1030 from the base stock and order 0. We must explicitly set mu_hat to (Total Ghost Pipeline + Expected Demand for L+1). Average demand since P30 is ~75 units/period. For L=2, we need 3 periods of coverage (225 units). Total mu_hat = 763 (ghost) + 225 (demand) = 988. We use 'calculate' for L as the backend handles observed lead times (averaging ~2.2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand volatility confirmed (P42 surge to 129). Cumulative lost shipments increased to 763 units (added P34 and P38 to the list of 517 legacy losses).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). Demand has shown significant volatility recently, with a massive spike to 129 in Period 42 followed by a dip, yet the underlying holiday-driven demand remains elevated compared to summer months. The primary operational challenge remains the high volume of lost/phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' pipeline. As of Period 44, the cumulative confirmed lost shipments total 763 units: P1(98), P3(40), P4(101), P10(11), P13(47), P17(204), P29(16), P34(95), and P38(151). The system reports 1030 units 'In-transit', meaning only ~267 units (1030-763) are likely to arrive. To force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 1030 from its target) to place an order, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~80 units/period * 3 = 240) plus the phantom pipeline of 763, totaling 1003. This ensures that the base stock level (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the 'ghost' pipeline, triggering the necessary restocking before the end of the game in Period 47.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the peak holiday season. Historical data shows a significant demand surge around late November (Period 42 demand: 129), and although recent demand has cooled (P43-P45 avg: 48), high volatility is expected during the Christmas/New Year transition. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of Period 46, on-hand is 182 and in-transit is 810. Based on carry-over insights, at least 763 units represent lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29, P34, P38). This means the effective pipeline is only 47 units (810 - 763). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 810 units and under-ordering, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1050, calculated as (1+L) * expected_holiday_demand + phantom_units (approx 3 * 95 + 763 = 1048), to ensure the system places an order if levels drop further. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for holiday demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 46, cumulative confirmed lost units remain at 763. The reported 'In-transit' of 810 is heavily comprised of these phantom units, requiring continued manual override of mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's pipeline inventory subtraction.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30. We are exiting the holiday surge (P42 demand was 129, but P43-P46 averaged ~46.5). On-hand inventory is 140. The 'In-transit' count of 969 is heavily corrupted by significant cumulative lost shipments. As established in Period 46, we confirmed 763 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P29, P34, P38). Additionally, P39 (ordered 0) and P41 (ordered 0) show no arrivals, and P42 (ordered 0) show no arrivals. P44 (ordered 0) is still within promised lead time. The valid pipeline consists of P45 (ordered 9) and P46 (ordered 159), totaling 168 units. With 763 confirmed phantom units, the real pipeline remains far below the recorded 969. I must continue using 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline). Average demand over the last 15 periods (excluding the P42 peak) is ~63. Adjusting mu_hat to ensure a base stock that covers (L+1) demand while accounting for the ~800 phantom units in the backend's calculation.
