The most recent data point (2019-02-04) showed a spike to 76, possibly indicating the start of a pre-spring upward trend for basic jersey tops. The current period is 2019-02-11. Demand analysis: historical mean is approx 53 units/week. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts while orders are in transit, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 approach). Total demand to cover: ~60 (P1) + ~65 (P2) + ~70 (P3) = 195 units. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will place an order to establish a safety stock and cover this initial pipeline requirement, accounting for the recent uptrend.",

Lead time: Promised is 2 periods, so the P1 order is expected to arrive at the start of Period 3. Performance: P1 demand was 135, but 0 were sold due to 0 starting inventory, resulting in lost sales. Forecast: Assuming the new demand level is ~135 units/week. Since the lead time is 2, I need to cover Period 2 (in progress), Period 3, and Period 4 demand. Total demand to cover = 3 * 135 = 405 units. Pipeline: 195 units arriving in P3. Shortfall = 405 - 195 = 210 units.

Since Feb 11 (Period 1), demand has averaged 130.6 (135, 149, 108). Period 3 saw a slight dip (108), but the trend remains significantly higher than the Jan baseline. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (ordered on Feb 11) is expected to arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. Looking at 'Period 3 conclude', arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or that the lead time is actually 3+ periods. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of P1 (195), P2 (210), and P3 (165), totaling 570. e) Order Logic: Based on a 3-period lead time (observed delay), I must cover\u9700\u6c42 for L+1 = 4 periods. Estimated weekly demand is ~130. Total coverage needed = 130 * 4 = 520. Pipeline is 570. However, because P1 did not arrive as expected, I am facing a prolonged stockout.

The date is early March, which is the start of the Spring/Summer fashion cycle in retail, explaining the significant jump from Jan/Feb historical demand (~50) to recent weekly demand (~110-150). b) Regime Analysis: Recent demand has been 135, 149, 108, and 91. The average over the last 4 periods is approximately 120 units. c) Lead Time/Missing Orders: In Period 4's conclude, we saw Period 2's order of 210 units arrive with L=2. However, Period 1's order of 195 units (placed Feb 11) is now 4-5 periods late and has not appeared in any 'conclude' message.

While 384 appears to cover 360, the high demand variance and the loss of the P1 shipment suggest we need a safety stock buffer to avoid stockouts if another shipment is lost or delayed.

Average demand over the last 5 periods is ~111, but the trend is currently downward as we exit the early-spring boost or correct from a spike. I'll forecast ~100 units/period to be safe. (c) Lead Time: P1 order (195) is lost. P2 order (210) arrived in P4 (L=2). P3 order (165) was expected in P5 but did not arrive, and 'arrived=0' was reported in P5 conclude. This suggests P3 may also be lost or delayed. P4 order (100) and P5 order (120) are in transit. (d) Inventory: On-hand is 47. In-transit consists of P3 (165), P4 (100), and P5 (120).

March in the Northern Hemisphere marks the beginning of Spring, leading to a sustained demand increase for lightweight basics. b) Demand Analysis: Historical demand (Jan/early Feb) was ~50. Recent demand (P1-P6) has averaged ~113 units/period (135, 149, 108, 91, 72, 124). While there is variability, the 'Everyday Basic' nature suggests a stable baseline around 110-120 units. c) Lead Time & Inventory: Lead time is volatile: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period, while P1 and P3 appear lost (or significantly delayed/injected into in-transit). In-transit is currently 540 units (calculated as: 195+165+100+80 = 540). However, P1 (195) and P3 (165) are likely lost based on previous carry-over insights. P4 (100) was placed 3 periods ago and hasn't arrived; P6 (80) was placed last period. Effective in-transit is likely only 180 units. d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 43.

This confirms a significant upward trend compared to February's ~90-100 range. April demand is expected to fluctuate between 140-180. c) Lead time/Loss: Shipment P1 (195) and P3 (165) are confirmed/highly likely lost. P2 arrived in 2 periods, while P5 arrived in 1 period.

This is lower than the early-April spike (P8: 227), but reflects a steady seasonal plateau. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods. The pipeline includes orders from P10 (350), P11 (150), and P12 (150). History shows a ~30-40% loss rate (P1, P3, P4 lost). d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 327. In-transit is 1110. Specifically, P10's order (350) is now at L=3 relative to P13 and has not arrived; it is likely lost based on previous patterns. P11 (150) and P12 (150) are within the L=1-2 window. e) Final Order Logic: Target stock for L+1 (3 periods) at a demand of ~140 is 420 units. With 327 on-hand and 300 units likely arriving soon (P11/P12), I have 627 units available. However, given the high loss rate, I must continue ordering to maintain the flow. Ordering 150 units to replace the average weekly consumption and provide a buffer against the high shipment loss rate.",

Total inventory position (On-hand 33 + In-transit P40 25 + In-transit P41 30 = 88) is sufficient to cover approximately 6-8 weeks of current demand levels. However, given the high loss rate, I must maintain a small buffer. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (up to Period 47), the goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. I will place a small order to hedge against potential shipment losses in the final weeks.",

P40 (25 units) is expected to arrive during the current P43 resolution. P41 (30 units) and P42 (20 units) are the only valid items in the pipeline; the other ~1400 in-transit units are confirmed historical losses. (d) Inventory: On-hand is 24.

There are only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47). Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($1.00) and the low demand regime, the priority is to bleed off existing inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. The in-transit figure of 1430 is almost entirely composed of lost historical shipments and does not represent usable incoming stock, but even if the P42 order (20 units) arrives, it would only increase the overstock.

Lead time is approximately 2-3 periods for successful deliveries, though there is a large amount of 'ghost' in-transit inventory from historical losses. Given the extremely high holding cost ($1.00) relative to the profit ($1.00), carrying excess stock is highly detrimental to the total reward.
