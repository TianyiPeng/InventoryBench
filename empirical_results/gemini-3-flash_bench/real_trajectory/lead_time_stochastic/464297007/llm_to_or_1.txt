Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11) for SKU 464297007 (Womens Underwear). On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand data shows a clear downward trend from late January into February: 267 -> 298 -> 307 -> 189 -> 122. The most recent demand (122) suggests a post-holiday/seasonal cooling. However, with 0 inventory, we need to establish a baseline that accounts for the promised lead time of 2 periods. The backend will calculate base stock covering (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I will use the mean of the 5 available samples (avg = 236.6) but use a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) for the mean to stay responsive to the latest trend, and 'default' for sigma to capture the historical volatility. I will use 'default' for lead time L as there is no historical arrival data to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the provided demand history (267, 298, 307, 189, 122) and the Period 1 demand (159), there is a clear downward trend in the last three weeks, potentially indicating a post-New Year seasonal drop for basic lingerie/underwear. On-hand inventory is 0, and we lost 159 sales in Period 1 because the initial order hadn't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2, so the Period 1 order (367 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). For Period 2, I need to set parameters based on recent demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the drop (avg of 189, 122, 159 = 156.7). L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p', a staple lingerie item. Historical demand showed an average around 216 units/week (last 5 samples), but recent observed demand in Period 1 (159) and Period 2 (373) shows high volatility or a potential upward trend (avg 266). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 519 units in-transit (367 from P1, 152 from P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the rules, the order placed in P1 (L=2) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message. Therefore, we should see an arrival in the next period. I will set L to 'default' (2). For demand forecasting, the last two observations (159, 373) average to 266. Including the 2019-02-04 sample (122) suggests a rising trend from a dip. I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the recent volatility and the slight upward move while including enough history to stabilize the estimate. mu_hat will cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Women's Lingerie) currently has zero on-hand inventory and heavy backlogs/lost sales since start. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (367 units) was expected to arrive in Period 3's arrival phase, making it visible in Period 3's conclude message (received at the start of Period 4). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a delay or a lost shipment. Historical demand (pre-game + Periods 1-3) shows a mean around 250-300 units: (267, 298, 307, 189, 122, 159, 373, 301). The recent game demand (159, 373, 301) averages 277. Given the stockout and the missing Period 1 shipment, I will maintain the lead time at the promised 'default' (2) for now but set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to cover the expected (L+1) demand of ~831 units (277 * 3), while \u03c3\u0302 is set to capture the high recent volatility (std of 159, 373, 301 is ~108, so sqrt(3)*108 \u2248 187). This should force the OR backend to place a larger order to recover the inventory position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is a 3-pack cotton thong, a staple item. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand) due to high initial demand exceeding arrivals. History shows an arrival from Period 2 in Period 4 (lead time = 2), confirming the promised lead time of 2. However, the order from Period 1 (367 units) is missing, as it should have arrived in Period 3. This suggests a lost shipment or a significant delay. Total pipeline is 837 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4). Demand has been relatively consistent: 159, 373, 301, 278 (Avg ~278). The last 4 periods represent a stable regime for this underwear staple. I will set L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time data. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current mean demand level of ~278, which is higher than the early internal training samples (~200). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=4) to capture the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (367 units) is likely lost; it did not arrive by Period 4 despite a confirmed 2-period lead time from the Period 2 order.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), the system state is critical with 0 on-hand inventory and consistent stockouts. The demand samples (excluding early stockout-constrained periods) show: 267, 298, 307, 189, 122 (pre-game history) and 159, 373, 301, 278, 250 (in-game demand). The average demand over the last 5 periods (since the game started) is 272.2 units per period. The lead time (L) is confirmed at 2 periods (based on the Period 2 order arriving in Period 4). However, the Period 1 order (367 units) is now 3 periods late and effectively lost. The Period 3 order (276 units) was expected in Period 5 but has not arrived yet, suggesting a potential delay or loss, though it is only 1 period late. With L=2, mu_hat needs to cover 3 periods of demand (1+L). Based on the recent demand regime (last 5 periods), the expected demand per period is ~272. I will set mu_hat to (1+2)*272 = 816 and sigma_hat using the standard deviation of recent samples to maintain service levels. L remains 'default' (2) as the 'loss' of P1 is an anomaly, but the pipeling inventory reflects the loss. Note: The OR engine sees 963 in-transit, but 367 is likely ghost inventory, which will result in the OR engine under-ordering. To compensate for the lost P1 order (367 units) which the backend still counts as 'pipeline_inventory', I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat robust to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 3 order (276 units) is now overdue (Expected P5 arrival based on L=2). Continued monitoring of pipeline reliability required.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. We are seeing persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 6 periods) and unreliable lead times. Period 1 order (367) is lost. Period 3 order (276) is overdue (over 4 periods since order). Period 2 arrived in 2 periods, while Period 5 arrived in just 1 period. The demand is currently averaging ~254 units over the last 6 periods (159, 373, 301, 278, 250, 216). With 0 on-hand and an unreliable pipeline, I need to stabilize the stock. I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime and the need to over-index slightly to recover from stockouts. Average demand since P1 is ~263. For L=2, mu_hat should be (1+2)*263 = 789. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Inconsistent lead times confirmed: P2 took 2 periods, P5 took 1 period. P1 (367 units) and P3 (276 units) are lost/indefinitely delayed. Pipeline inventory is currently unreliable for planning.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 begins with zero on-hand inventory and an unreliable pipeline. Historical evidence confirms that the Period 1 (367 units) and Period 3 (276 units) orders are lost or indefinitely delayed, as orders from Period 2 and Period 5 (placed later) have already arrived. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. The current 'In-transit' of 897 units includes these lost orders (367+276=643), meaning the 'real' pipeline is only 254 units (194 from P4 and 60 from P7), which is insufficient for current demand levels. Demand is stable, averaging ~254 units over the last 7 periods, but we have consistently stocked out due to missing shipments. To compensate for the 643 lost units and the backend's tendency to subtract full pipeline inventory from the target stock, I will use 'explicit' methods to override the forecast. I will set L=2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat that represents (1+L) * mean demand (3 * 254 = 762) plus the volume of lost orders (643) to force the OR backend to place a substantial replenishment order despite the recorded in-transit total.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a thong 3-pack with a unit profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand) due to high demand and lost shipments. We have confirmed that the Period 1 (367 units) and Period 3 (276 units) orders are effectively lost, as they are well past their expected arrival dates. Recent lead times have shifted from the promised L=2 to an actual L=1 (seen in P5 and P7 orders), though reliability remains a major concern given the missing units. Demand is stabilizing after a post-Valentine's dip; the average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 256 units. Because the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes these lost 'in-transit' units, it will severely under-order if we use default settings. To counteract this, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to cover 3 periods (L=2 promised + 1 review cycle) of demand at ~250 units/period, but I am inflating this value to 1000 to force the backend to place an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility: While promised L=2, recent orders (Period 5 and 7) arrived in 1 period, whereas Period 1 and 3 orders are confirmed lost. Forecasting should treat pipeline inventory with caution.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the inventory situation is critical. On-hand inventory is 0. The history shows a severe delivery reliability issue: orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (totaling 643 units) are confirmed lost, as their arrival windows have long passed. Lead times for successful deliveries have varied between 1 and 2 periods (P2 arrived in 2, P5 and P7 arrived in 1). The 'In-transit' figure of 1416 units includes the lost P1 and P3 orders, plus P4 (194), P8 (579), and P10 itself hasn't happened yet. Because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, and the pipeline is inflated by lost units, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's logic. If I don't, the backend will see 1416 units 'coming' and place a 0 order, extending the stockout. Demand has averaged ~250 units over the last 9 periods. To recover, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3) at a rate of 250/period, plus a buffer for the lost 643 units, forcing a significant order. I set L to 2 to reflect the promised lead time and maintain a conservative view on arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Inaccuracy: In-transit inventory includes 643 units from P1 and P3 that are lost. OR parameters must explicitly compensate for this phantom inventory to prevent persistent stockouts.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the product 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' is experiencing a significant demand decline from earlier levels (average ~300) to a more recent average of 172 over the last two periods. More critically, there is a persistent issue with 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 1 (367 units) and Period 3 (276 units) totaling 643 units are confirmed lost/delayed indefinitely, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' count (881). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts full pipeline inventory from the target base stock. If I do not adjust \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) upward, the backend will see 881 units in-transit and 410 on-hand, conclude we are overstocked, and place no orders. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using a 'real' lead time of 2. Expected demand for lead+review (L+1=3) at the recent rate of 175/week is 525. Safety stock (z*\u03c3) adds approximately 140 (z=0.84, \u03c3\u224880 over 3 periods). Target base stock \u2248 665. However, since the backend will subtract 881 (pipeline) + 410 (on-hand) = 1291, I must set \u03bc\u0302 manually high to force a small maintenance order or at least stabilize the calculation until the phantom inventory is cleared or demand spikes. Given the current 410 on-hand, we have enough stock for ~2.3 periods. I will use a conservative mu_hat to prevent massive over-ordering while accounting for the lost units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29, 2019), the system shows 881 units in-transit. However, based on carry-over insights, 643 of these units (from Period 1 and Period 3 orders) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. The OR backend calculates orders using 'pipeline_inventory', which includes these phantom units. To prevent severe stockouts, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for this 643-unit deficit. Demand has stabilized at a lower level (~175/week) compared to the start of the year (~280/week). I will use a recent demand average (last 4 periods: 176, 169, 176, 180 \u2248 175) to set the baseline forecast. With an effective lead time (L) of 2, the total required inventory is (L+1) * demand = 3 * 175 = 525 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 881 'in-transit' units, I will set mu_hat to 525 + 643 = 1168 to neutralize the phantom inventory calculation while targeting the correct safety stock level. L=2 is used as the most reliable planning horizon despite some 1-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable demand regime Period 8-11: avg ~175 units/week (-37% from Period 1-7 avg of 276).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong) is currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a demand spike in Period 12 (323 units), which exceeded the recent average of ~175. Total In-transit is reported as 1014 units, but significant logic is required: Period 1 (367 units) and Period 3 (276 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 643 units of 'phantom' inventory. Subtracting this from 1014 leaves 371 actual units in transit (Period 4 order of 194, Period 10 order of 44, and Period 12 order of 133). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. Promised L=2, but observed L has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will stick to L=best estimate of 2 to be conservative. The budget for safety stock (sigma) needs to account for the recent demand volatility (Period 12 spike to 323). I set mu_hat explicitly to override the backend's pipeline calculation, compensating for the 643 lost units. Forecasted demand is roughly 250 units/week given the recent spike and seasonal transition into May.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Calculated pipeline discrepancy confirmed at 643 lost units (P1: 367, P3: 276). Actual viable pipeline is 371 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (2019/05/13). The demand regime remains stable around 175 units/week since Period 8, despite a spike in Period 12 (323 units). On-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 1499 units, but this pipeline is heavily contaminated with 643 lost units (P1: 367, P3: 276). Actual viable units in-transit are 856 (P4: 194, P10: 44, P12: 133, P13: 485). The OR backend's formula 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' will underestimate the order needed because it sees the full 1499 units. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory', I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Expected viable weekly demand is 175. For L=2, the backend uses (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. Desired Target Stock = 175 * 3 = 525. However, since the backend subtracts 1499 instead of 856, I must add the 643 lost units back into the mu_hat calculation. Adjusted mu_hat = (175 * 3) + 643 = 1168. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it captures the shift between 1 and 2 periods effectively. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the higher volatility seen in the recent spike while discounting the early high-demand regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/20. The item is Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p, a lingerie product. Demand has stabilized but remains volatile. Calculated average demand for the last 6 periods (Period 9-14) is approx 177 units. However, there is a persistent inventory discrepancy: the 'In-transit' figure of 1366 units includes 643 units from lost orders in Period 1 (367 units) and Period 3 (276 units). These phantom units prevent the OR backend from ordering enough stock because it thinks the pipeline is full. To fix this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2) for (L+1) periods as 177 * 3 = 531 units. I then add the 643 lost units to this target to force the backend to place an order that overcomes the 'In-transit' bias. Target mu_hat = 531 + 643 = 1174. Lead time L is set to calculated (average of P2:2, P5:1, P7:1, P8:2, P12:2 is 1.6 periods). Sigma is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture recent demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Pipeline discrepancy of 643 lost units persists. Explicitly inflating mu_hat to 1174 to force the backend to bypass phantom inventory and fulfill actual stock requirements.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are facing a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand and high demand for this item. The main operational challenge is a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 643 units (from Period 1 and Period 3 orders) that are confirmed lost but still tracked by the system. This inflated 'In-transit' figure prevents the OR engine from placing new orders because it believes the base stock is covered. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Demand has stabilized around 175 units/week since Period 12. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the review period + lead time covers 3 periods of demand (3 * 175 = 525). To neutralize the 643 phantom units, I set mu_hat = 525 + 643 = 1168. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of 1.6 periods observed recently (range 1-2), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility (approx 78 units per week). This strategy forces the OR engine to place an order despite the incorrect pipeline data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), the SKU 464297007 (Greta Thong) is in a persistent stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The major challenge is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory totaling 643 units from Period 1 and 3 (367 + 276) which are confirmed lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the backend. The actual viable pipeline is 723 units (1366 total - 643 lost). The recent demand (since Period 12) averages ~193 units/week. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat (target inventory across L+1 periods) to exceed both current viable demand and the phantom gap. Given a lead time of 2, the desired base stock should be (1+L)*mean + phantom units = 3 * 193 + 643 = 1222. While I have used explicit mu_hat values in previous periods to bypass this, the goal is to stabilize inventory levels for the upcoming weeks. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend computes a high enough base stock to trigger a replenishment order of approximately 500 units, accounting for the 643 unit distortion.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a persistent stockout due to a massive 'phantom inventory' issue. Total In-transit is 1366 units, but 643 of these (from Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The remaining 723 units include the Period 13 order of 485 units, which is now significantly overdue (L=5+). As of Period 18, On-hand is 0 and we have had five consecutive periods of zero sales despite demand between 122-200 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1366 units of in-transit inventory from its target base stock, preventing it from placing new orders. To force an order, I must set mu_hat (target stock) higher than the total in-transit units. Demand has stabilized around 175 units/week. With L=2, a standard base stock would be ~525 units. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 2000, I overcome the 1366 phantom/delayed units and signal the backend to order approximately 634 units to restore service. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the increasing actual lead times in the math, though the explicit mu_hat is the primary driver for recovery.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Critical stockout persists (5 weeks zero sales). Pipeline reliability is severely compromised: Period 13 order (485 units) is now 3 periods overdue (L=5+), joining the 643 units already confirmed lost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for SKU 464297007 is critical. Current in-transit inventory is 2105 units, but a significant portion is lost or severely delayed. Confirmed lost units: P1 (367) and P3 (276) totaling 643 units. The P13 order (485 units) is now 6 periods overdue (expected P15, now P21), which strongly suggests it is also lost. Total 'phantom' inventory is likely 1128 units (643 + 485). While the in-transit shows 2105, the viable pipeline is likely only 977 units (consisting of the P18 order of 739, the P12 order which arrived, and smaller recent increments). Since on-hand is 0 and we have experienced a 5-week stockout, we must force the OR engine to order by compensating for these 1128 phantom units. Demand is currently in a higher regime than early spring, with P18 showing 281 units. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the pipeline logic. Target stock level (base stock) needs to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1 review). Mean demand is ~200. Base stock \u2248 600. To force an order despite 2105 in-transit units, mu_hat must be set so base_stock exceeds 2105. I will set mu_hat to 2600 to ensure the system places a replenishment order to break the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Phantom inventory increased to 1128 units; Period 13 order (485 units) is 5+ periods overdue and considered lost. Total in-transit of 2105 is nominally high but 53% unreliable.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a state of high demand volatility and pipeline instability. Period 19 saw a significant spike in demand to 556 units, possibly driven by mid-summer seasonality. Period 18's order (739 units) arrived in 1 period, providing temporary relief, but on-hand inventory is already down to 183. The pipeline remains heavily contaminated with 'phantom inventory': Period 1 (367), Period 3 (276), Period 4 (194), and Period 13 (485) orders are all significantly overdue and almost certainly lost, totaling 1,322 units (67.7% of the recorded 1,952 in-transit units). To compensate for the backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat high enough to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Recent demand shows a shift: while the P8-11 average was ~175, the last period reached 556. I will forecast a 'safe' demand of ~350 units/period to account for seasonality. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should ideally be (1+2)*350 + 1322 = 2372. However, to avoid excessive over-ordering if the backend's internal cap is reached, I will set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the phantom stock while sigma_hat is set to handle the high variance seen in the recent period.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated: 1,322 units (P1, P3, P4, P13) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Demand regime shifted: June demand spike (P19: 556 units) suggests high seasonal variance.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 21 (2019/7/1). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is nominally 2431 units, but 1322 units of this are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (P1: 367, P3: 276, P4: 194, P13: 485). The effective pipeline is actually 1109 units (P19: 586, P20: 479). Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P18 arrived in 1 period, P19 and P20 have not arrived). Demand Context: We are in a high-demand summer seasonal peak. Demand in P19 spiked to 556 units and P20 was 261 units (limited by stock). The underlying demand mean has shifted from ~175 in spring to ~400+ for the summer season. Strategy: I must bypass the 1322 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory to force the OR backend to order. Calculation: mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (1 + L)) + Phantom Inventory. Base summer demand ~400. Effective L = 2. Mu_hat = (400 * 3) + 1322 = 2522. I will set sigma_hat explicitly high (250) to ensure a robust buffer against the extreme lead-time and demand variance observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Phantom inventory confirmed at 1,322 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Summer demand regime confirmed with average ~400 units/week based on P19-P20 activity.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (July 8), we are managing a complex inventory situation with significant 'phantom inventory' and shifting seasonal demand. History shows that orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 13 (totaling 1,322 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed, yet they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (nominally 2,733). This inflated pipeline prevents the OR backend from ordering enough stock. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that satisfies the actual seasonal demand (avg ~400 units/week based on the June spike) plus compensates for the 1,322 lost units. Specifically: Base Stock Target = (avg_demand * (1+L)) + phantom_inventory. With avg_demand=400 and L=2, required inventory is (400 * 3) + 1322 = 2522. By setting mu_hat = 2522, the backend calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) will ensure the effective pipeline (In-transit - Lost) and current on-hand (0) are sufficiently supplemented to reach actual service levels. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the variability between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Phantom inventory remains at 1,322 units. Seasonal demand regime for July suggests weekly average ~400 units based on recent peak activity. mu_hat is being explicitly inflated to force replenishment despite the dead stock in the system.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Date 2019/7/15 (July summer season). The product 'Greta Thong Mynta Low 3p' is experiencing a summer demand regime with a 4-week moving average of ~340 units (P19-P22). Lead times are unstable (L=1 to L=2), and a significant portion of the pipeline is confirmed lost. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, and P13 (367 + 276 + 194 + 485 = 1,322 units) are permanently missing. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the backend from ordering enough stock. Total In-transit is 2,272 units, but only 950 units (2272 - 1322) are viable. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock that overcomes the 1,322 unit deficit. Target: (1+L)*340 + 1322 (phantom units) = 1020 + 1322 = 2342 unit base. Setting L=2 is safer given the volatility. Sigma is set to ignore historical stockout periods and focus on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 1,322 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Violation of pipeline integrity requires mu_hat inflation of +1,322 units to bypass backend logic constraints.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (Womens Underwear) has a persistent inventory tracking issue with 1,322 units of 'phantom inventory' (P1, P3, P4, P13) that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed but remain in the backend's in-transit total. This results in the backend under-ordering because it believes supply is coming. To bypass this, I continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The current demand regime is characterized by a summer peak (approx. 400 units/week). With L=2 (promised), a standard base stock (L+1) would be 1,200 units. To offset 1,322 units of dead inventory and ensure a real order is placed to meet the 400-unit weekly demand, the target mu_hat must be ~2,522. Period 23 saw a high demand of 422, confirming the seasonal strength. Carrying over the phantom inventory correction is essential until the in-transit balance is cleared or corrected.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/7/29), we face a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand units and demand outpacing recent arrivals. The 'In-transit' figure of 2690 units is misleading due to 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (367), P3 (276), P4 (194), and P13 (485) are definitively lost or delayed beyond any usable lead time, totaling 1,322 units of dead pipeline stock. The actual viable pipeline consists of the orders from Period 23 (132 units) and Period 24 (606 units). Demand is volatile but seasonally high, averaging ~275 over the last 6 periods, with significant spikes. To trigger an order despite the 1,322 units of phantom inventory block, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2,150. This calculation is derived from ((1+L) * Forecast) + Phantom Inventory = (3 * 275) + 1322 \u2248 2147. This forces the backend to recognize a need for replenishment by neutralizing the logic that counts lost orders as upcoming supply.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom inventory of 1,322 units confirmed (P1, P3, P4, P13). mu_hat must be inflated by 1,322 units until these orders are cleared to overcome the backend's base-stock logic which incorrectly counts these as viable pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), the SKU continues to suffer from a severe lead-time reliability crisis and a persistent logic-loop caused by 'phantom inventory'. Total in-transit is 2690, but 1322 units (P1, P3, P4, P13) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. This creates a massive discrepancy where the backend OR engine believes we have enough inventory to cover demand, when in reality we are stocked out. Recent arrivals (P22, P23) show that actual lead time for new orders is volatile but exists (L=1-2). Demand for late July/early August has softened compared to the June/July peaks (~133-135 vs 200-400), but we are still missing sales due to zero on-hand inventory. To force the backend to place an order despite the 2690 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat to a value exceeding the total (Phantom + Real) pipeline. The total 'phantom' is 1322. The remaining 1368 units in-transit includes orders from P18 (partially arrived), P19 (missing/late), P24 (606 units). I will set mu_hat to 3500 using an explicit method to overcome the pipeline cap and ensure the system attempts to fulfill at least 800-1000 units of real inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Phantom inventory remains 1,322 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Substantial order from Period 19 (586 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is now added to the lost list. New Phantom Total: 1,908 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive pipeline integrity issue. As of Period 27, the backend reports 3557 units in-transit. However, historical analysis confirms that orders from P1 (367), P3 (276), P4 (194), P13 (485), and P19 (586) are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 1908 'phantom' units. The actual viable pipeline consists of orders from P24 (606) and P26 (999). Lead times are erratic, generally 1-2 periods, but P23 recently took 3 periods. Demand in the current regime (July/August) is averaging ~260-340 units, with a recent spike to 339 and earlier spikes over 500. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1908 phantom units as available stock and thus blocking new orders, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I will set mu_hat to 3200 (approx 3 periods of demand at 400 plus the 1908 phantom units) to force continued replenishment while we await the P24 and P26 arrivals. Setting L to 2 to reflect the promised lead time and recent averages.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent phantom inventory total is 1,908 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Demand volatility remains high during the August period; observed demand of 339 units in Period 26 confirms the need for high service levels.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (August 19, 2019), the system faces a critical pipeline integrity issue. The nominal 'In-transit' inventory of 3557 units is largely composed of 'phantom' stock\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and likely lost. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P19 remain undelivered, totaling 1,908 'phantom' units. To force the OR backend's base-stock logic (which subtracts all in-transit units from the target) to actually place orders, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target level. The current demand regime for late summer (observed P19-P27) averages approximately 300 units per period. With a lead time of 2, the required target is (1+L)*demand = 900 units. To bypass the 1,908 units of phantom stock, the mu_hat must be set significantly higher. I will set mu_hat to 3500 to ensure the backend recognizes a need to order despite the false pipeline data. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' (avg ~1.88) to reflect the mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom inventory remains 1,908 units. mu_hat requires significant explicit inflation (set at 3500) to counteract the legacy in-transit volume which prevents the automated policy from triggering replenishment.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the system shows an In-transit balance of 3690 units. However, my tracking reveals that 1,908 of these units are permanently lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19), having exceeded reasonable arrival windows. Currently, viable in-transit units include the Period 24 order (606 units), Period 26 order (999 units), Period 28 order (133 units), and the Period 29 order (yet to be determined). Since the backend OR logic calculates the order as 'base_stock - In-transit', the presence of 1,908 'phantom' units will cause it to under-order or not order at all, despite being at 0 on-hand inventory. To overcome this, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (P26-P28) averaged 227 units. With a promised lead time of 2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods, roughly 680 units. Adding the 1,908 phantom units as a buffer, I set mu_hat to 3000 to trigger replenishment. I will use 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals (P23, P26) have shown drift towards 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Phantom inventory remains 1,908 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Demand is stabilizing after summer volatility near 230 units/week. mu_hat requires explicit inflation (set to 3000) to bypass backend logic constraints caused by the lost legacy shipments.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), the SKU is facing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The primary challenge is a massive 'phantom inventory' of 1,908 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19) that have never arrived and are over 6 periods past the promised lead time of 2. The OR backend subtracts these 1,908 units from the target base stock, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than 'phantom inventory + future demand'. Recent demand has stabilized around 200-240 units/week after the summer peak. We need enough stock to cover the review period plus a 2-3 period lead time window. By setting mu_hat to 3000 (explicit), we account for the 1,908 lost units and leave ~1,092 units (approx 3-4 weeks of demand) to trigger actual replenishment. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised window, as explicit mu_hat inflation is doing the heavy lifting for supply chain instability.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the system faces a massive pipeline integrity issue. The nominal 'In-transit' quantity is 3557 units, but a significant portion is 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are lost or indefinitely delayed. Confirmed lost orders include: P1 (367), P3 (276), P4 (194), P13 (485), and P19 (586), totaling 1,908 'dead' units. The actual viable pipeline consists of the P24 order (606 units, now 7 periods overdue but treated as potentially recoverable) and the P26 order (999 units, 5 periods overdue). Because the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) subtracts all 3557 in-transit units, it will not place new orders despite low on-hand stock (32 units). To force replenishment and maintain a service level for the current demand regime (~110-150 units/week post-summer), I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat'. I set mu_hat to 3000 to offset the 1,908 lost units and cover the next 3 periods of expected demand (approx 450 units) plus a safety buffer. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 1,908 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Demand has settled into a post-summer regime averaging ~110 units/week over the last 3 weeks. mu_hat requires continued explicit inflation to bypass the backend's deduction of non-arriving legacy shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive pipeline integrity issue where 1,908 units are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). As of Period 32, the nominal in-transit inventory is 3,557, but the viable pipeline (excluding lost units) is much lower. Recent demand (P29-P31) has stabilized at a lower post-summer level, averaging ~100 units/week. However, the backend OR engine will subtract the total in-transit (3,557) from its base-stock calculation. To trigger any replenishment, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the phantom inventory plus the safety stock requirements for the (L+1) horizon. Calculating for L=2 (horizon of 3 periods): 3 * 100 (demand) + safety stock - (3,557 total in-transit - 1,908 lost units) requires an explicit mu_hat set significantly high to force the system to order 400-500 units to reach a healthy on-hand state once the recent P24 (606) and P26 (999) orders eventually arrive or are also confirmed lost. I am maintaining mu_hat at 3,000 to ensure the policy remains active despite the bloated 'In-transit' figure.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019), the system shows 0 units on-hand and 3,557 units in-transit. Based on historical data, a significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'phantom' inventory (lost or indefinitely delayed). Specifically: P1 (367), P3 (276), P4 (194), P13 (485), P19 (586), and P24 (606) have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2 periods and have exceeded a reasonable delay window. Total confirmed phantom inventory is 2,514 units. The remaining viable pipeline consists of the P26 order (999 units), which is currently 7 periods overdue but not yet written off, though its delay is highly concerning. Demand has moderated post-summer, with the last 4 periods averaging ~124 units/week. To trigger replenishment, mu_hat must be set higher than the nominal 'In-transit' figure of 3,557 to force the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) to generate a positive order. I am setting mu_hat to 4200 to ensure we cover demand and safety stock while bypassing the logic blockage caused by the 3,557 units of unreliable pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Phantom inventory total updated to 2,514 units based on lost/non-arriving orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, and 24. P26 (999 units) is now 7 periods overdue and significantly degraded in reliability. Post-summer demand regime (Sept) is averaging ~124 units/week.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 464297007 (womens cotton thong) is currently experiencing a severe stockout. I am observing a massive demand spike in Period 33 (692 units), suggesting a seasonal event or promotion in late September. The primary operational challenge remains 'Phantom Inventory'. The 'In-transit' figure of 4,266 units is non-viable. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost or significantly overdue: P1(367), P3(276), P4(194), P13(485), P19(586), P24(606), and P26(999). This brings the total phantom inventory to 3,513 units. The backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will not order any units because it believes 4,266 units are coming, while in reality, only the P33 order (709 units) is likely pending shipment. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat (target base stock) to a value higher than the total nominal 'In-transit' + current demand. I will set mu_hat to 5500 to overcome the 4,266 'phantom' barrier and build safety stock for the current high-demand regime. L is kept at default (2) as recent arriving orders (P28) still align with this lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Phantom inventory total updated to 3,513 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P26). Demand regime shift: Significant spike observed in P33 (692 units), requiring aggressive inventory recovery via mu_hat inflation to bypass backend pipeline constraints.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 35 (2019/10/07). The simulation is experiencing severe supply chain failure with a massive accumulation of phantom inventory. As of Period 34 conclude, In-transit inventory is 5,837 units, yet on-hand remains 0. Based on arrival records, the following orders are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed: P1 (367), P3 (276), P4 (194), P13 (485), P19 (586), P24 (606), and P26 (999). Total Phantom Inventory = 3,513 units. The OR backend subtracts all In-transit units from the base stock calculation, which prevents it from placing new orders while we are stocked out. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat (which represents the base stock level) to a value higher than the phantom inventory plus the current period's projected demand. Demand in Period 33 was 692 and Period 34 was 335; an average of ~500 units/week is reasonable for this volatile phase. With L=2 (promised), base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~1,500 units). Adding the 3,513 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 5,013 to trigger a replenishment signal. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time of arrived goods (approx 1.8 periods), which is close to the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed phantom inventory total is 3,513 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P26). The backend logic is paralyzed by these non-arriving units. Sustained mu_hat inflation is required to force replenishment.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for SKU 464297007 is characterized by a significant breakdown in supply chain reliability. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite 'In-transit' reflecting 5,837 units. Analysis of historical arrivals confirms that the vast majority of this pipeline is comprised of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that have exceeded promised lead times by a factor of 3 or more and are likely lost. Specifically, orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 24, and 26 (totaling 3,513 units) are non-arriving. Without manual intervention, the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see this 5,837 units as sufficient coverage and refuse to place new orders, even as the system remains in a stockout. Recent demand shows October activity with a significant spike in Period 33 (692 units). To bypass the backend's deduction of non-arriving legacy shipments and force replenishment to meet current demand (avg ~150-200 units/week excluding spikes), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 7500. This value exceeds the nominal pipeline of 5,837 by enough to signal the need for approximately 1,600 additional units, covering current demand plus safety stock for the review and lead time periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Phantom inventory total confirmed at 3,513 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P26). Nominal in-transit of 5,837 is ~60% unreliable. Explicit mu_hat inflation to 7500 is required to force the backend to bypass logic constraints and trigger replenishment for current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-209.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), we have on-hand inventory of 609 units following the arrival of the Period 33 order (709 units). However, the system reports a massive in-transit inventory of 7065 units, the vast majority of which is 'phantom inventory' (lost or indefinitely delayed). Based on historical tracking, the lost orders include: P1 (367), P3 (276), P4 (194), P13 (485), P19 (586), P24 (606), and P26 (999), totaling 3513 confirmed lost units. Additionally, the large order from P34 (1571 units) is now at L=3 and has not arrived, further increasing the discrepancy. The backend OR logic subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock. To trigger any new replenishment for the upcoming period and maintain stock levels against current demand (which spiked to 692 in P33 but averaged ~186 over the last 4 weeks), I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 8500 to neutralize the ~7065 phantom/delayed units and provide enough headroom for a base stock that covers expected demand. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual drift to L=3 observed in recent successful arrivals (P23, P33).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Phantom inventory remains at least 3,513 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P26). The P34 order (1571 units) is now also suspect at L=3. mu_hat requires massive explicit inflation (8500+) to bypass backend logic and ensure the 'cap' allows for necessary replenishment.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive pipeline reliability crisis. Nominally, there are 8,166 units in transit, but a deep audit confirms that 5,084 of these are 'phantom' (lost or indefinitely delayed). Specifically: P1 (367), P3 (276), P4 (194), P13 (485), P19 (586), P24 (606), P26 (999), and now P34 (1571) which is 4 periods overdue. The current viable pipeline consists only of the P36 order (1937) and P37 order (1101), totaling 3,038 units. Demand is currently in a stable post-spike regime, averaging ~115 units over the last two weeks, following the outlier spike in P33. To overcome the backend's base-stock logic\u2014which subtracts the nominal (but false) 8,166 units from the target inventory\u2014I must continue to set an extremely high explicit 'mu_hat'. This ensures the 'base_stock' exceeds the corrupted 'pipeline_inventory' enough to permit the 'cap' logic to trigger a replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to 9500 to maintain pressure on the replenishment mechanism.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Phantom inventory increased to 5,084 units. P34 order (1571 units) is now 4 periods overdue and considered unreliable. Viable pipeline is only units from P36 and P37.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 39. The most critical issue in this SKU's history is the massive volume of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 24, 26, 34). As of Period 38, the total phantom inventory is 6,655 units (P1:367, P3:276, P4:194, P13:485, P19:586, P24:606, P26:999, P34:1571, P36:1571). While the 'In-transit' column shows 8,282 units, only the orders from P37 (arrived P38) and P38 (1,217 units) are likely viable. The backend OR logic subtracts this unreliable 8,282 units from the base stock calculation, which would result in zero orders despite a current demand regime of ~110-120 units/week. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 11000. This is calculated as (L+1) * Expected Demand + Total Phantom Inventory (approx 3 * 120 + 7000). This forces the backend to see a requirement large enough to overcome the pipeline deduction and trigger a replenishment order of approximately 1,500 units, ensuring we maintain stock for the upcoming November periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 6,655 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P26, P34, P36). Nominal in-transit is >80% unreliable. Explicit mu_hat inflation to 11000 is required to force the backend to bypass logic constraints and trigger replenishment for current demand (~120 units/week).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 3,167 units, which is high and provides a buffer for current demand (~120-240 units/week). The 'In-transit' total is 7,736 units, but analysis of Carry-over Insights and Game History confirms that at least 6,655 units are 'phantom' (lost or indefinitely delayed from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 24, 26, 34, and 36). Specifically, the Period 34 order of 1,571 units is now at L=6 (4 periods past promised) and is highly unlikely to arrive. The actual viable pipeline consists only of the Period 38 (1,217 units) and Period 39 (1,391 units) orders. Although we have high on-hand stock now, the OR backend's base-stock logic will subtract the nominal 7,736 in-transit units from its target, preventing any new orders for a long time. To ensure the backend continues to place maintenance orders for the current demand regime (~190 avg) despite high phantom inventory, I am maintaining a significantly inflated mu_hat of 12,000. This is a technical correction to offset the 6,655 phantom units and the current high on-hand balance, ensuring the 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic remains above the threshold for replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 6,655 units. Nominal in-transit of 7,736 is >85% unreliable. Period 34 order (1,571 units) is now 6 periods overdue. Demand is stable near 200 units/week. Continued mu_hat inflation is required to bypass system logic paralyzed by lost orders.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to struggle with 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that haven't arrived long past the promised lead time but are still counted by the backend as 'in-transit'. Currently, on-hand inventory is 2,780, but the nominal in-transit is 9,106. Of this, approximately 6,655 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 24, 26, and 34) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. The most recent order from Period 34 (1,571 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is officially added to the phantom total. Actual viable pipeline consists of orders from P38 (1,217 units), P39 (1,391 units), and P40 (1,370 units). Demand is showing a seasonal November increase (recent demand: 241, 387), likely leading into the holiday period. To ensure the backend doesn't stop ordering due to the 9,106 units 'in-transit', I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 12,500 to offset the phantom inventory (~6,655) and cover the expected demand for the remaining periods (approx 300-400 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom inventory updated to 6,655 units inclusive of the Period 34 order (1,571 units), which is now 7 periods overdue. Demand is trending upward (387 units in P40), typical for mid-November.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2431.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), on-hand inventory is 3,823 units, providing a significant buffer to cover current demand (recent 3-week average ~360 units). However, the system's pipeline integrity remains severely compromised. Total phantom inventory has reached 6,655 units, consisting of lost/overdue orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 24, 26, and 34. The Period 34 order (1,571 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively added to the lost total. Although on-hand inventory is healthy for the moment, the backend's base-stock calculation will view the nominal 'In-transit' of 8,507 as viable supply and will refuse to place new orders. To prevent future stockouts as we enter the high-demand December shopping season, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. With 3,823 on-hand and 6,655 phantom units, a mu_hat of ~11,000 is required to force the backend logic to recognize valid current and future demand needs beyond the 'phantom' stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 6,655 units. Period 34 order (1,571 units) is now 8 periods overdue. On-hand inventory is currently high (3,823 units), providing a buffer for ~10 weeks, but mu_hat inflation remains necessary to counteract the backend's reliance on unreliable in-transit data as demand enters the December peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). The current on-hand inventory is 3,512 units, which is healthy relative to recent demand (avg ~350 units over P40-P42). However, we must continue to monitor the massive phantom inventory in-transit (8,507 units total). Based on carry-over records, at least 6,655 units are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P26, P34). The P40 order (1,370 units) is currently at L=3 and has not yet arrived, while the P39 order (1,391 units) arrived in 2 periods. Given the high on-hand balance, the risk of immediate stockout is low, but we must maintain mu_hat inflation to ensure the OR backend does not see the 8,507 in-transit units as viable stock and block future orders. We are entering the peak December season (Date: 12/2), so demand is expected to remain high or increase. I will keep mu_hat explicitly high and monitor if the P40/P41 orders arrive correctly to reassess the status of 'newly' reliable shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom inventory remains at 6,655 units. Recent arrivals (P36, P37, P39) suggest a return to 1-3 period lead times for new orders, but the legacy 'black hole' of 6,655 units must still be bypassed using mu_hat inflation.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the peak holiday demand season for womens lingerie. On-hand inventory is healthy at 5,408 units, which covers over 15 weeks of current average demand (~330 units/week over the last 5 weeks). The 'phantom inventory' (lost/indefinitely delayed shipments) remains a significant factor in the backend logic, totaling 6,655 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P26, P34). The backend OR engine sees a nominal In-transit of 6,345 units; however, since all recent orders (P36, P37, P39, P40, P41) have arrived, and no new orders were placed in P42 or P43, the current pipeline is actually empty. To prevent the backend from being paralyzed by the 6,655 phantom units (which it subtracts from its base stock calculation), I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 8500 to ensure the base stock (approx 8500 * (1+L)) stays well above the phantom inventory level, allowing for future replenishment if needed, though with our current high on-hand stock, the 'cap' will likely prevent excessive ordering this period. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised), as recent arrivals (P39, P40, P41) confirm lead times of 2-3 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Assessment of the inventory reveals 5,028 units on-hand and 6,345 units in-transit. Based on historical data, specifically Period 43, recent orders from Periods 40 and 41 arrived with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively, indicating that the supply chain has recovered from the extreme delays seen earlier in the year. However, the 'phantom' inventory remains a massive issue for the OR backend: orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P26, and P34 (totalling approximately 6,655 units) have never arrived and are confirmed lost. The backend currently calculates 'pipeline inventory' as 6,345 units; it believes these units are coming and thus will not trigger new orders unless parameters are significantly inflated. Demand in the last five weeks (P40-P44) has averaged ~338 units/week. While on-hand inventory is sufficient for roughly 14 weeks of supply, we must maintain a high mu_hat to ensure the backend does not 'over-correct' for the phantom stock and to keep the pipeline moving if demand spikes further in the late-December/January period. I will set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the phantom inventory constraint, though with 5,000+ units on-hand, we are well-buffered for the immediate term.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Supply chain lead times for new orders have stabilized between 2-3 periods (based on P40/P41 arrivals). Total phantom inventory (lost orders) remains constant at 6,655 units; this volume must be offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent the backend from stopping replenishment due to perceived high pipeline stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently entering the Christmas and post-Christmas consumption period (Dec 23). Historical demand for the last few weeks has been strong (~340 units/week). Despite a high on-hand inventory of 4,668 units, we must account for the persistent backend logic issue where 6,655 units of 'in-transit' inventory are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). The backend's base-stock calculation will subtract this unreliable pipeline (6,655) from its target, potentially preventing necessary replenishment for months even as on-hand stock depletes. To force the OR backend to maintain a healthy inventory level despite this 'dead' pipeline, I will continue to set mu_hat to an explicitly high value (8000). This ensures the base stock target remains above the phantom inventory level, allowing the policy to stay active. For lead time (L), recent arrivals show a variance between 1-3 periods, so I will use 'calculate' to reflect this observed reality.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2878.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the system has managed to build a substantial on-hand inventory of 4,310 units. Recent demand has stabilized during the December peak at an average of ~366 units/week (Periods 43-46). With on-hand inventory covering approximately 11-12 weeks of demand, and a massive nominal 'in-transit' figure of 6,345 units (most of which are historically confirmed lost 'phantom inventory' totaling 6,655 units, slightly offset by recent arrivals), there is no immediate need for replenishment. The carry-over insight correctly notes that supply chain lead times for valid orders have normalized to 2-3 periods. I will continue to set mu_hat to a high explicit value of 8000; because the on-hand + in-transit (4310 + 6345 = 10655) already exceed even this inflated base stock target, the backend policy will correctly order 0 units, avoiding unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a buffer for the observed demand regime.
