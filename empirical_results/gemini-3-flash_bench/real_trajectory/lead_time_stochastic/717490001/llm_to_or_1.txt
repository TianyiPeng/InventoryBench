Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 717490001 (Cat Tee). The historical demand shows a declining trend: 100, 66, 70, 62, 53 over the last 5 weeks. The mean of these 5 samples is 70.2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use a conservative estimate based on the recent demand trend. I'll use L=2 (default). For mu_hat, considering the recent drop, I'll use the mean of the 5 historical samples: (1+L)*70.2 = 3 * 70.2 = 210.6. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of the 5 samples is approximately 17.6; sqrt(1+L)*17.6 = sqrt(3)*17.6 \u2248 30.5. Given the product is a 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt and we are in mid-February, we are approaching a potential spring demand increase, but the recent data shows a cooling off from a January peak. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior while maintaining enough samples for stability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand from early Jan to early Feb showed a downward trend (100 -> 53). In Period 1, the demand was 41, continuing this trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the first order was placed in Period 1 and has a promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in P1 with L=2 will arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message (read at P4 START). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in P1 conclude is expected. We have 100 units in-transit. Mean demand of all samples (including P1) is (100+66+70+62+53+41)/6 = 65.33. Given the recent decline, I will use recent_N=4 to better capture the current lower demand regime (~51.5). I will keep L at default (2) as no evidence yet suggests a lead time deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt' which typically sees stable demand but can be influenced by seasonal transitions into spring. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first two orders haven't arrived yet (promised lead time is 2). In Period 1, we ordered 100 units, and in Period 2, we ordered 77 units (total 177 in-transit). Given L=2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Demand data shows: 100, 66, 70, 62, 53 (pre-start samples) and 41, 107 (observed in game). The mean of all 7 samples is ~71.3. Period 2 saw a significant spike in demand (107). To ensure high service level and account for possible upward demand shifts as spring approaches, I will use a conservative demand estimate. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the recent samples 70, 62, 53, 41, 107) to better reflect current volatility and the recent spike. I will stick to the default promised lead time of 2 as there's no evidence yet of delivery delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). This is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), a basic jersey item. Historical demand was approx 50-100 units/week. Recent periods (P1-P3) saw demands of 41, 107, and 106. The average of last three periods is 84.6. The promised lead time is 2. According to rules: Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 arrival resolution and be visible in Period 3 conclude (read at P4 START). However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the lead time is likely longer than 2, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since P2 and P3 also have orders in-transit, I will explicitly set L=3 to account for this observed delay and increase the base stock calculation to cover the longer pipeline. I will use the last 3 periods (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~85) compared to the initial historical samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which likely sees steady demand as a basic item, though demand has been quite high (averaging 87.4 over the last 5 periods including historical samples). Looking at lead times: the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (2 periods), which matches the promised lead time. The Period 1 order (100 units) is now 2 periods overdue (placed P1, expected P3, currently P5) and has not appeared in a 'conclude' message, suggesting it is likely lost. Current on-hand is 0, with 342 units in transit (P1: 100, P3: 95, P4: 147). However, if P1 is lost, effective pipeline is only 242. Demand samples: [100, 66, 70, 62, 53, 41, 107, 106, 83]. The last 4 periods (P1-P4) show high volatility and a significant mean (avg ~84). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this recent higher demand regime. To account for the likely lost shipment in Period 1, I will slightly set 'L' to 3 to exert more upward pressure on the base stock/inventory position through the OR backend, ensuring the system orders enough to cover the gap left by the missing 100 units.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a basic T-shirt. Historically, demand was around 50-100 units prior to the game start, and in-game demand has averaged 81.6 units per period (41, 107, 106, 83, 71). The promised lead time is 2. Arrival observations: Period 2 order (77 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). However, the Period 1 order (100 units) has NOT arrived as of the end of Period 5, which is 4 periods after ordering. Given the 2-period promise, this is a significant delay or potential loss. Period 3 (95 units) should have arrived in Period 5 but didn't. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 439 units. The OR engine needs to recognize the current shortfall. Since shipments are missing/delayed, I will keep L at default (2) but monitor for arrival trends. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the 5 in-game demand samples (avg=81.6; (1+L)*81.6 = 244.8) to capture the higher in-game demand level compared to the pre-game samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. The SKU is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which likely sees increased demand as spring progresses. Historical demand shows a recent spike to 147 units in Period 6. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 2 periods (Period 4 arrival) and 1 period (Period 6 arrival). Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 342 units in-transit (orders from Period 1, 3, and 4 are still pending). Period 1's order is now 6 periods old, suggesting it is lost. Period 3's order is 4 periods old, also potentially delayed or lost. Given the shift to higher demand (average of last 3 periods is ~100) and the spring seasonality, I will use recent_N for demand parameters (N=3) and stick to the default lead time for now while monitoring for lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), which typically sees increased demand as spring progresses. Historical demand for the last three periods (P5-P7) shows a significant upward trend: 71, 147, and 177 units. Mean demand has shifted from ~70-80 to ~150+ in recent weeks. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 418 units in-transit. Lead times have been inconsistent: P2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), while P5 order arrived in 1 period (P6). The P1 and P3 orders (total 195 units) are significantly overdue (5+ periods), suggesting they are likely lost. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the spring demand surge and use calculate for L to account for the observed lead time variability, while maintaining a higher sigma to protect against stockouts given the recent demand volatility and potential shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 6 (March 18): average demand increased from ~70 to ~160 (+128%) likely due to seasonal spring T-shirt demand. Shipments from Period 1 and Period 3 (195 units total) are likely lost as they have exceeded promised lead time by 5+ periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a T-shirt, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand since March 18 (Period 6) has averaged ~142 units per week (147, 177, 101), significantly higher than the February average of ~81. Orders from Period 1 (100 units) and Period 3 (95 units) are now 6-8 periods past their order date and are confirmed lost, as their combined transit time far exceeds the observed lead times of 1-2 periods. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 475, but 195 of those are 'ghost' units from lost shipments, leaving a real pipeline of 280 units (Period 4 order of 147 and Period 8 order of 133). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet current high demand (approx 140-160/week) and covers the (L+1)=3 week horizon, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (Period 6-8) to capture the seasonal shift. I will set actual lead time L=2 to be conservative despite recent 1-period arrivals, as the system needs to buffer for potential variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, and the product is a cotton T-shirt, which is in peak spring demand. Analysis of periods 6-9 shows a sustained higher demand regime compared to the initial winter periods, despite a dip in Period 9 (85 units). The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 127.5 units. Shipments from Period 1 (100 units) and Period 3 (95 units) are confirmed lost as they are many periods past the promised lead time of 2. Recent successful arrivals (Ordered P5 arrived P6, Ordered P7 arrived P8) show an actual lead time of 1 period. Therefore, I will set L to 1. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current spring demand regime (avg ~127.5 per period). Since on-hand is 0 and we have heavy stockouts (sold=0 in Period 9), the OR backend needs to place a significant order to cover (L+1) periods of demand, while accounting for the 535 units still in-transit (though 195 of those are likely ghosts).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time of 1 period based on Period 6 and Period 8 arrivals. Shipments from Period 1 and Period 3 (195 units) are definitely lost. Demand regime for Spring (N=4) is stabilized around 127 units/period.

LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/04/22). History confirms that shipments from Period 1 (100 units) and Period 3 (95 units) are lost, as they are now 8-10 periods overdue. The actual lead time has stabilized at L=1 or L=2 (average of recent arrivals P6, P8, P10 is (1+1+2+1)/4 = 1.25), while the promised lead time remains 2. Using L=1 (explicit) is appropriate given recent patterns (P6, P8, and P9 all arrived in 1-2 periods). Demand context: The product is a jersey T-shirt. Historically, demand shifted upwards in late March/April (Spring season). Demand in the last 4 periods was 177, 101, 85, 84 (Mean: 111). I will use recent_N (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand Spring regime (147, 177, 101, 85, 84). Current on-hand is 109, and in-transit is 342, but since 195 units are confirmed lost, effective pipeline is 147. Setting L=1 allows the OR backend to set a base stock covering 2 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are managing a 'Cat Tee' T-shirt during its spring peak. The 'In-transit' quantity (342) includes lost units from Period 1 (100) and Period 3 (95), which have never arrived. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 342 - 195 = 147 units (representing the order potentially placed in Period 4 that remained unsatiated or later adjustments). We have 0 on-hand inventory after stockouts in Period 11. Demand from Period 6 onwards (April regime) has averaged approximately 119 units per period (147, 177, 101, 85, 84, 120). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (actual). I will set L to 1 to reflect the most frequent recent lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current spring demand level (~119/period) across the lead time + review period (1+1=2 periods). Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the last 6 periods to account for the heightened volatility seen in the spring season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are in a stock-out situation with 0 on-hand inventory. History confirms that orders from Period 1 (100 units) and Period 3 (95 units) are lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 342 units actually includes several orders placed between Periods 4 and 12 that have not yet arrived, though observed lead times range between 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.4). Demand for this 'Cat Tee' dropped slightly from the mid-March peak but remains steady. Using samples from the last 7 periods (Periods 6-12), the mean demand is 115.4 units per period. I will set L to 2 (promised) to be conservative given the recent arrivals of 0. mu_hat is calculated using the recent regime of 7 samples (115.4 * (1+2) = 346.2). sigma_hat is calculated similarly from the recent regime to capture the stabilized volatility. The goal is to aggressively trigger an order while discounting the 'zombie' units in the pipeline that are likely lost.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 342 units contains 195 units (Orders 1 & 3) now confirmed as lost after 10+ periods; actual active pipeline is significantly lower than reported total.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the product 'Cat Tee' (Jersey T-shirt) is in a stabilized spring demand regime. Average demand over the last 8 periods (since Period 6) is approximately 109 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0 and the in-transit inventory is listed as 447 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from Period 1 (100 units), Period 3 (95 units), Period 4 (147 units), and Period 5 (which seems to have arrived but possibly miscounted in pipeline) must be scrutinized. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, and P4 (total 342 units) are extremely overdue (10+ periods) and are confirmed lost. The actual active pipeline consists only of the order from Period 13 (105 units). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, I will set L to 1 (actual observed lead time) and uses explicit 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to force a base stock that overrides the inflated pipeline count. I will set mu_hat based on the recent average demand (~110) multiplied by (1+L)=2, and sigma_hat based on recent volatility. Given the backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline', and pipeline is 447 while true pipeline is 105, I must set the base stock high enough to account for this 342-unit discrepancy.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 342 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4) which are lost. Active pipeline is only 105 units. Demand remains stable for T-shirts in May at ~110 units/period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a jersey T-shirt. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 4 periods (P11-P14) has averaged 88.75 units, showing a slight cooling from the peak spring surge but remaining significant. A major issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 736 units. Analyzing the history: Orders from P1 (100), P3 (95), and P4 (147) totaling 342 units are definitively lost (phantom inventory) as they are 10+ periods overdue. The active pipeline consists of P13 (105) and P14 (289), totaling 394 units. However, because the backend OR engine subtracts the full 'In-transit' (736) from the base stock, it will under-order or not order at all, risking prolonged stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. Expected demand is ~90. Recommended Base Stock = 90 * 2 = 180. To offset the 342 lost units the backend thinks are coming, I set mu_hat = 180 + 342 = 522. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility. Lead time calculation is set to recent_N=5 since actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory contains 342 units of 'phantom' inventory (Orders P1, P3, P4) that are lost. Parameters must be adjusted to over-propose base stock to compensate for the backend's deduction of these non-existent units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing a T-shirt (Jersey Basic) which is in the middle of its high-demand spring/early summer season. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' quantity of 736 units is highly misleading. Based on historical data, several orders are definitively lost (phantom inventory): Period 1 (100), Period 3 (95), Period 4 (147), and Period 5 (already arrived, but likely miscalculated in the backend pipeline if it shows 736). Total phantom inventory is likely 342 units. The active pipeline consists of orders from Period 13 (105) and Period 14 (289), totaling 394 units. However, because the OR backend subtracts the full 736 units from its base_stock calculation, it will refuse to order unless we provide an artificially inflated 'explicit' mu_hat. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged ~110 units. With an inferred lead time (L) of 2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (~330 units). To force the backend to place an order despite the 736 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to exceed that value plus safety stock. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this gap and ensure we secure stock for the coming weeks.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 736 units contains 342 units of 'phantom' inventory from early-period lost shipments (P1, P3, P4). Parameters must remain inflated to bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction until these are cleared or offset.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 3rd (Period 17). Demand for 'Cat Tee' remains steady as summer arrives. The most critical issue is 'phantom' in-transit inventory totaling 342 units from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4. These units are still tracked by the OR backend as 'Pipeline' but will never arrive. Additionally, orders from Periods 13 (105 units) and 14 (289 units) are now overdue (L=2 promised, but it is now Period 17), suggesting potential logistics delays or further losses. In-transit stands at 1160, but only the 424 units from Period 16 are currently 'active' and potentially arriving soon. To prevent the OR backend from ordering zero due to high (but fake) pipeline inventory, I must use 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock that accounts for the phantom 342 units plus the 394 units from P13/P14 which may be lost. Target mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. Expected weekly demand is ~110. With L=2, (110 * 3) + 342 (confirmed lost) + 394 (overdue/likely lost) \u2248 1066. This high explicit value forces the backend to place an order despite the 1160 'in-transit' signal.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 13 (105 units) and Period 14 (289 units) are now officially overdue (4+ periods since ordering), increasing the 'phantom' inventory from 342 to 736 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this Jersey T-shirt remains high due to summer seasonality, averaging approximately 136 units/period over the last 3 periods (117, 138, 154). We currently have 270 units on-hand. The critical issue is the 'in-transit' inventory of 736 units. Analyzing the history, arrivals for orders from P1 (100), P3 (95), P4 (147), P13 (105), and P14 (289) are missing. These sum to 736 units, matching the system's 'in-transit' value. Since actual lead time is confirmed to be 1-2 periods (as seen in P11 and P17), these orders are almost certainly lost. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 736 from the target base stock. To trigger a new order and maintain stock for the upcoming weeks, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock of ~1050 to offset the 736 phantom units and 270 on-hand units, ensuring the logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful net order to cover upcoming demand (approx 135-150 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory reached 736 units as of Period 17 (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 are lost/overdue). Parameters must be explicitly inflated to counteract the OR engine's pipeline deduction until these are cleared.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Mid-June). Demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized at a higher regime (Summer/Spring) with recent samples averaging ~110-154 units. The main challenge is the presence of 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Based on history, orders from Period 1 (100), Period 3 (95), Period 4 (147), Period 13 (105), and Period 14 (289) are effectively lost, totaling 736 units. The backend OR engine calculates 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With a reported 'In-transit' of 890 units, 736 of which will never arrive, the OR engine will subtract 736 units from its target inventory calculation, potentially ordering zero. To counteract this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that captures: (Target Base Stock) + (Phantom Inventory). My target base stock for a lead time of 1 (actual) + 1 (review) = 2 periods is approximately 140 units/period * 2 = 280 units. Adding the 736 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1016. Because L=1 is the verified actual lead time from recent successful arrivals (P16 arrived in P17), I use an explicit L of 1.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 736 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). These lost shipments force a manual inflation of mu_hat to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Actual lead time remains 1 period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand for the 'Cat Tee' T-shirt has stabilized in a high-demand regime (avg ~146 over the last 5 periods: 117, 138, 154, 129, 165). Actual lead time is consistently 1 period (observed in P17, P19). The critical issue remains the massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 736 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) which the OR backend subtracts from the base stock calculation, preventing it from ordering despite these units being lost. With 130 on-hand and only 56 units in the 'true' pipeline (from P19), the actual inventory position is 186 units. To force the OR engine to place an order that covers the true pipeline requirement (~300 units for L+1), I must set mu_hat (the target base stock) to a level that exceeds both the phantom pipeline and the desired stock. Total reported in-transit is 792 (736 phantom + 56 real). Desired base stock is ~320. Therefore, mu_hat must be set to ~1112 (792 + 320). I will use the explicit method to bypass the standard calculation and ensure the OR engine triggers an order of approximately 160-200 units to maintain service levels during this high-demand summer period.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 736 units. Real-world actual lead time is 1 period. Demand regime for summer T-shirts is stable at ~145-150 units/period. Parameters must be explicitly inflated by ~740 units to counteract the backend's deduction of lost shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), we are in the peak summer demand regime for t-shirts. Demand has stabilized between 130-165 units per period. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The system reports 1025 units in-transit, but based on history, orders from P1 (100), P3 (95), P4 (147), P13 (105), and P14 (289) are likely lost as they are significantly past the observed lead time of 1-2 periods. This totals 736 units of 'phantom' inventory. To prevent the OR backend from subtracting these 736 non-existent units from our target base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Anticipated demand for the next two periods (L+1, where L=1) is 150 * 2 = 300 units. To offset 736 lost units and ensure an order is placed, mu_hat must be set to approximately 300 + 736 = 1036. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for demand volatility in a stock-out situation.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 736 units. Real-world actual lead time is consistently 1-2 periods. Demand remains high (avg ~150) for summer. Explicit mu_hat inflation is required to bypass OR backend logic.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08. Demand for T-shirts remains high in the summer, with the last observed demand at 206 units and a recent average around 150-160 units/period. The main challenge is the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14 (totaling 736 units) are lost, yet they remain in the backend's pipeline calculation. Additionally, the Period 20 order (233 units) and Period 21 order (77 units) are in-transit, totaling 1102 units reported. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline from the target base stock, it will not order anything unless the base stock target exceeds 1102. To ensure we receive ~160 units (the expected demand for the next lead time period plus safe buffer), I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - phantom_pipeline' equals my desired stock level. Target = (Desired Order + Phantom) = 160 + 736 = 896. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1300 to force the backend to place an order that covers current demand and replenishes the stock-out, while overriding the inflated pipeline. Lead time 'L' is set to 1 based on recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Phantom in-transit inventory (lost/overdue shipments) remains constant at 736 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Real-world lead time is consistently 1 period based on P16 and P18 orders. Demand is peaking for the summer season.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15, peak summer season for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (last 6 periods) averages ~150 units. The 'phantom' in-transit inventory is the primary challenge. Orders from P1 (100), P3 (95), P4 (147), P13 (105), and P14 (289) are effectively lost, totaling 736 units. The OR backend subtracts the total reported in-transit (1136 units) from the calculated base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed to meet upcoming demand, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 736 phantom units. 

Lead time (L) is set to 1, as recent successful deliveries (P16, P18, P20) arrived with 1-2 period lead times (averaging ~1.3). Using L=1, the base stock formula ismu_hat = (1+L)*demand. Target demand for two periods is ~300. To offset the 736 phantom units and ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger an order, I calculate: Target mu_hat \u2248 (300 units real demand) + (736 phantom units) = 1036. This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic results in a positive order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains at 736 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Demand for July remains strong (~150/period). mu_hat must continue to be explicitly inflated to bypass OR backend logic until phantom units are removed.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for this Jersey T-shirt remains high due to the summer season, though the last period showed a brief dip to 79. Looking at the regime since June, average demand is approximately 140 units per period. The critical issue remains 'phantom inventory'. Total in-transit is reported as 792 units. Based on historical arrivals, orders from P1 (100), P3 (95), P4 (147), P13 (105), and P14 (289) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (lead times of 9-23 weeks), totaling 736 phantom units. The remaining 56 units in-transit from P19 are also currently overdue (promised L=2, now at 5 periods). Actual lead time for successful deliveries (P20, P21, P22) has stabilized between 1-2 periods. To ensure the OR engine actually orders enough to cover future demand, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (736) plus the required safety stock for the current demand regime (~140 * (L+1)). I will use explicit mu_hat = 1150 (approx 736 + 140 * 3) and an explicit L of 2 to maintain a 1500+ base stock level, forcing the backend to ignore the fake pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Phantom in-transit inventory persists at 736 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Order from P19 (56 units) is now also likely lost or severely delayed (5 periods since order). Summer T-shirt demand regime average is ~140 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29, 2019), the 'phantom' in-transit inventory persists at 792 units. This total consists of confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (100 units), Period 3 (95 units), Period 4 (147 units), Period 13 (105 units), Period 14 (289 units), and now Period 19 (56 units), which has exceeded its expected lead time of 1-2 periods by more than 5 periods. The OR backend subtracts this the full in-transit amount from the calculated base stock (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline). Since the active pipeline is much smaller, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to roughly (Base Stock Target + Phantom Pipeline). Current demand for this jersey basic T-shirt is in a stable summer regime; average demand over the last 10 samples is approximately 130 units. To maintain a base stock covering ~3 periods (L+1=3) at 130 units/period (~390 units) while overcoming the 792 units of phantom inventory, I set 'mu_hat' to 1182 (390 + 792) to ensure the OR engine places an order that maintains stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Phantom in-transit inventory increased to 792 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19 are lost/overdue). Actual lead time remains estimated at 1-2 periods. Period 24 demand (87) was a slight dip, but the summer regime average remains ~130 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the product (soft jersey T-shirt) is entering the end of the summer season. On-hand inventory is 215 units, with a reported in-transit of 991 units. Tracking the history of orders reveals a massive accumulation of 'phantom' inventory: Orders from P1 (100), P3 (95), P4 (147), P13 (105), P14 (289), and P19 (56) are significantly past their promised (2) and actual (1-2) lead times, totaling 792 lost units. The OR engine deducts these 792 units from the base stock calculation, which would result in zero orders if not corrected. The actual active pipeline contains only the orders from P24 (80 units) and P25 (119 units). Demand has stabilized around 85 units per period over the last few weeks (P22-P25 avg: 90.5). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be inflated by the 792 lost units plus the desired service level coverage (approx (1+L)*100). Setting L=1 based on recent arrivals. mu_hat target = 792 (phantom) + 200 (demand) = 992.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 792 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). Actual lead time is consistently 1-2 periods. Late summer demand is stabilizing at approximately 85-90 units/period down from July peaks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August), the product (soft jersey T-shirt) is exiting its peak summer demand phase. Demand has stabilized downwards from July peaks of ~150 to a late-summer average of 85-90 units per period (last 3 periods: 87, 83, 60). The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The system reports 991 units in-transit. Based on historical tracking, this includes lost shipments from P1 (100), P3 (95), P4 (147), P13 (105), P14 (289), and P19 (56), totaling 792 phantom units. The actual active pipeline consists only of orders from P24 (80 units) and P25 (119 units), totaling 199 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 991 units from the base stock calculation, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is placed. To maintain a safety stock for a demand of ~85 units with an actual lead time (L) of 1, the desired base stock (1+L)*Demand + Safety is roughly 250 units. To bypass the 991 unit deduction and current on-hand of 155, I set mu_hat to 1250 to force the backend to consider a target that accounts for the phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Late summer demand regime confirmed at ~85 units/period. Phantom in-transit inventory stable at 792 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). Actual lead time remains 1-2 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 28 (Aug 19, 2019). Analyzing the history (P24-P27), demand has stabilized into a late-summer lower-regime average of approximately 72 units per period (Avg of 87, 83, 60, 57). The 'phantom' in-transit inventory remains the primary operational challenge. Based on CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19 (totaling 792 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed. Additionally, the order from P24 (80 units) has now hit its promised lead time of 2 periods without concluding in P27, adding it to the 'likely lost' or delayed list, bringing the phantom total to 872 units. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' (1021 units) when calculating the order. To ensure the backend actually places an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the phantom inventory. Estimated actual lead time (L) is consistently 2. Total replenishment target = (1+L)*Demand + Phantom = (1+2)*72 + 872 = 216 + 872 = 1088. Explicitly setting mu_hat to 1088 will bypass the 1021 units of in-transit, allowing a small order to cover current demand while maintaining the safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom in-transit inventory increased to 872 units as Order P24 (80 units) is now 3 periods old with no arrival. Late summer demand regime confirmed at ~72 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for this basic T-shirt is in a late-summer transition. Recent demand samples (Periods 24-28: 87, 83, 60, 57, 178) show a mean of ~93, though the 178 in Period 28 is a significant spike likely related to late-season promotions or school prep. The phantom inventory issue is severe: the system reports 1021 units in-transit. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost or significantly overdue: P1(100), P3(95), P4(147), P13(105), P14(289), P19(56), and now P24(80). This totals 872 units of 'phantom' inventory. The OR engine subtracts this 1021 from its base stock calculation. Therefore, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass this. To maintain a safe inventory level for a demand average of ~90 units/period with a 2-period lead time (L+1=3 periods), the desired base stock is approximately 320 units. To achieve this when the backend subtracts 1021, I must set mu_hat to approximately 1021 + 320 = 1341. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual 1-2 period delivery speed observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Phantom in-transit inventory increased to 872 units as Order P24 (80 units) is confirmed lost/overdue. Total reported in-transit is 1021; actual active pipeline is only 149 units (from P27). Demand remains volatile but averages ~90 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation for Period 30 (2019/09/02): Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (178 and 248), potentially signaling a late-summer clearance or back-to-school spike for T-shirts. The 'phantom' in-transit inventory problem has worsened: orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P24 (totaling 872 units) are definitively lost/severely overdue. Additionally, the order from P27 (149 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, which is suspicious given the 1-2 period lead time history. Reported in-transit is 1443, but subtracting confirmed lost units (872) leaves a 'real' pipeline of 571 (P27 and P29). Demand regime mean over the last 5 periods is approx 126, but the last 2 periods suggest a much higher volatility and mean. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the OR backend's tendency to subtract the massive (mostly phantom) in-transit volume, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected 'real' pipeline needs plus a massive offset for the 872 phantom units. Expected demand (L+1) is ~400 based on recent spikes, plus 872 offset = ~1272.

Carry-over insight: Phantom in-transit inventory confirmed at 872 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Order P27 (149 units) is now overdue (3 periods), potentially increasing phantom count to 1021 units. Demand spiked to 248 units in P29.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the 'phantom' in-transit inventory remains high. Analysis of the game history confirms that orders from P1 (100), P3 (95), P4 (147), P13 (105), P14 (289), P19 (56), and P24 (80) have not arrived and are significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. These lost shipments total 872 units. Currently, the system reports 1370 units in-transit, but the actual active pipeline consists only of orders from P29 (422 units) and P30 (76 units), totaling 498 units. The remaining 872 units are 'phantom' and will never arrive, but the OR engine will subtract them from the base stock calculation, leading to under-ordering. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand for the next two periods (L+1) based on the recent average of approximately 100-120 units, plus an inflation of 872 units to offset the phantom pipeline. Demand spiked recently (P29: 248, P30: 131), suggesting a potential late-season surge or school-related shopping. I will set mu_hat to 1250 (calculated as ~350 units for demand + 872 inflation).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory confirmed at 872 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Order P27 arrived in P30 with a lead time of 3 periods, indicating occasional lead time jitter. Current active pipeline is 498 units (P29, P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16), demand is transitioning from summer peaks into a post-peak autumn regime. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has been volatile, averaging 138 units due to a spike in Period 29, but the most recent figure is 77. The total 'In-transit' quantity of 1464 units is heavily distorted by 872 confirmed 'phantom' units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). The active pipeline consists of P29 (422 units), P30 (76 units), and P31 (94 units), totaling 592 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 872 phantom units it subtracts from the base stock calculation, I must continue to explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter. I am setting mu_hat by estimating the required base stock (forecasted demand for lead time + review period \u2248 120 * 3 = 360) and adding the 872 phantom units to neutralize the backend's deduction. This results in a mu_hat of 1232. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead time (~2.1 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 872 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Order P27 arrived in P30 (LT=3). Active pipeline is 592 units. Parameters must continue to be explicitly inflated to offset phantom stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1830.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 conclude, on-hand inventory is 70. Reported in-transit is 1294 units. However, based on history, orders from Period 1 (100), Period 3 (95), Period 4 (147), Period 13 (105), Period 14 (289), Period 19 (56), and Period 24 (80) are all significantly overdue and considered lost. This creates 872 units of 'phantom' inventory. Additionally, the large order from Period 29 (422 units) is now 4 periods old (promised 2). If P29 is also lost, phantom inventory rises to 1294, exactly matching the reported in-transit, meaning the real pipeline is zero. Given mid-September (transition from summer to autumn) and demand fluctuations (averaging ~100 over the last 4 visible periods), I will maintain an inflated mu_hat to bypass the OR backend's logic, which would otherwise subtract the phantom 1294 units and result in zero order. I estimate real demand at ~110 and will set mu_hat to approximately 110 * 3 + 1294 to ensure a replenishment order is triggered.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 33, total phantom in-transit inventory reached 1294 units as Order P29 (422 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P24. The reported in-transit equals the total lost inventory, implying a zero real pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sept 30), the simulation reports 1748 units in-transit. Based on historical arrival logs, I confirm that orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, and now P29 (422 units which is 5 periods overdue) are 'phantom' inventory that will likely never arrive. Total phantom inventory = 100+95+147+105+289+56+80+422 = 1294 units. The remaining 454 units are from the P33 order, which is still within the expected lead time (1-3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1748 in-transit units from its base_stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 1294 ghost units. Demand in Sept has trended upward (avg ~144 over the last 4 weeks), peaking at 191 in P33. I will set a base expectation of 150 units/period. For a lead time of 2 (3 periods coverage), mu_hat should be 3 * 150 = 450. To bypass the phantom pipeline deduction, I inflate mu_hat to 450 + 1294 = 1744. I set sigma_hat explicitly high to handle the high volatility observed in late summer/early fall.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Phantom in-transit inventory increased to 1294 units as Order P29 (422 units) is confirmed lost/overdue (5 periods since ordering). Valid active pipeline consists only of P33 (454 units).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this jersey T-shirt SKU has seen recent spikes (P29: 248, P33: 191), but the underlying regime since September averages around 110 units/period (N=6 calculation: (248+131+77+100+191+83)/6 = 138, but removing the high outlier P29 gives 116). The critical issue remains the massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Reported in-transit is 2073 units. Based on historical analysis, the following orders are lost/severely overdue: P1(100), P3(95), P4(147), P13(105), P14(289), P19(56), P24(80), and now P29(422). Total lost = 1294 units. Additionally, the order from P33 (454 units) is now at lead time (ordered P33, today is P35 decision) and P34 (325 units) is in the first lead period. True active pipeline is 454 + 325 = 779 units. The backend will deduct the full 2073 units from any base_stock calculation. To ensure an order is placed to meet upcoming demand (~120 units/period) with a lead time of ~2 periods, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the subtraction of 2073 phantom units. Specifically, I want a base stock around 400-500. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 2500 (2073 phantom + ~427 required stock).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Phantom in-transit inventory increased to 1294 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29). Total reported in-transit is 2073; active pipeline is only 779 units (P33, P34). Demand is averaging ~115 units/period in the fall transition.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (mid-October), we are managing a T-shirt SKU. Recent demand is averaging approximately 111 units per period (last 6 periods). However, the major challenge is the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Our records confirm that orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, and P29 are lost/severely overdue, totaling 1,294 units. These units are still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend but will never arrive. The total reported in-transit is 2,694. This means the active/real pipeline consists of P33 (454), P34 (325), and P35 (621), totaling 1,400 units. To prevent the OR backend from subtracting the 1,294 phantom units from the order calculation (rendering it zero), I must explicitly set mu_hat to cover both the target base stock and the phantom inventory. Target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods is ~333 units. Adding 1,294 units brings the required mu_hat to ~1,627. I will set mu_hat to 1,700 to ensure a robust order is generated to refill the empty on-hand stock, using L=2 (promised) and explicit variance.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,294 units (confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29). Actual active pipeline is 1,400 units (P33, P34, P35). Demand for fall is stable at ~110 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 (Oct 21), we are managing a T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (last 5-7 periods) has stabilized around 110-120 units, reflecting a post-summer moderation. The primary challenge remains the OR backend's calculation of base stock, which subtracts 'pipeline inventory'. Our reported in-transit is 1619 units, but a large portion consists of lost shipments (Phantom Inventory). Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, and P29 are confirmed lost/overdue. Analysis of Period 36 conclude shows Order P33 (454 units) arrived (LT=3) and Order P35 (621 units) arrived (LT=1). Order P34 (325 units) is currently in its 3rd period of transit and is the only 'real' pipeline. Total phantom inventory calculation: Total In-transit (1619) - Real Pipeline (325) = 1294 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the next 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~360 units) while it erroneously subtracts 1294 units from our target, we must set mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock should be (Desired Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 360 + 1294 = 1654 units. We use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this value.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' in-transit inventory remains 1294 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29 are lost). Periodic arrivals (P33, P35) confirm actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this T-shirt SKU has stabilized in the fall season, averaging ~110 units over the last 5 periods. A major constraint remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As per 'Carry-over Insights', orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, and P29 are lost/overdue, totaling 1,294 units. The reported in-transit is 1,619 units, meaning the active pipeline consists of Order P34 (325 units). However, the system's OR backend will deduct the full 1,619 units from any base stock calculation. With on-hand inventory at 839 units and an active pipeline of 325 units, the true inventory position is 1,164 units (covering ~10 periods of demand). The OR engine view is 839 (on-hand) + 1,619 (in-transit) = 2,458 units. To prevent the system from sitting on too much inventory while also ensuring the 'phantom' units don't cause an under-order in the future, I will set mu_hat explicitly to encompass the phantom count plus a safety buffer for the next 3 periods of demand. Given the current high on-hand levels from the P33 and P35 arrivals, no new order is needed this period. I set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current 'inflated' pipeline plus desired stock to maintain the status quo.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,294 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29). Active pipeline is 325 units (P34). On-hand inventory is high (839) following recent large arrivals, providing sufficient coverage for the next ~7 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the on-hand inventory is 725 units. The confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains at 1294 units (comprising lost orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, and P29). Total reported in-transit is 1619 units, meaning the actual active pipeline is only 325 units (from Order P34). Current demand for fall has stabilized around ~115 units per period. With 725 units on-hand and an active pipeline of 325 units, the total real stock (1050 units) covers approximately 9 periods of demand. Given the actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, we are significantly overstocked. To prevent the OR backend from ordering more units while it believes phantom inventory is real, and to allow the current high on-hand stock to deplete toward a more efficient level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect current demand stability, but will rely on the current high inventory to carry us through. No new order is desired this period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the current on-hand inventory is 630 units. We are in a fall demand regime for T-shirts, with recent demand averaging approximately 105 units per period (P36-P39: 108, 128, 114, 95). The total 'phantom' in-transit inventory remains at 1619 units. This is composed of the previously identified 1294 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29) plus the Period 34 order of 325 units, which is now 6 periods overdue and clearly lost. Since the reported in-transit is 1619 and our calculated phantom total is 1619, the true active pipeline is zero. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite this massive reported pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the desired base stock. With an on-hand of 630 (~6 periods of cover) and demand around 105, we don't strictly need more inventory yet, but to maintain the 'bypass' logic and prepare for any potential late-year demand shifts, I will maintain an explicit mu_hat inflation. I'm setting mu_hat to 1950 (Phantom 1619 + ~3 periods of demand) to ensure the system is ready to order when on-hand drops further, while L=2 reflects the observed jittery but usually short lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Phantom in-transit inventory increased to 1619 units as Order P34 (325 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, joining the existing list (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29). Demand regime for Nov is stable at ~105 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18), the system reports 1619 units in-transit. Based on historical data, every single unit of this reported in-transit is confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost or severely overdue): Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29 (total 1294) and now Order P34 (325 units, 7 periods old). Total phantom = 1619 units. The actual active pipeline is Zero. The OR engine subtracts 'in-transit' from the 'base_stock' to calculate the order; because reported in-transit (1619) is significantly higher than any realistic base stock, the engine will order 0 units unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these ghost units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 509 units. At a current demand rate of ~105-110 units/period (stabilized fall demand), this covers approximately 4-5 periods. To prevent a stockout in December and to force the backend to potentially place a small replenishment order despite the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to (Total Phantom + Target Base Stock). Target Base Stock = (1+L)*demand + safety. With L=2 and demand=110, Base Stock \u2248 400. Thus, mu_hat is set to 1619 + 400 \u2248 2019 to neutralize the pipeline deduction and maintain the current service level.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory reached 1619 units as of Period 40 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, and now P34 are confirmed lost/overdue). Reported in-transit now consists entirely of lost units, meaning the real pipeline is zero.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the product (T-shirt) is in a stable late-fall demand regime with an average of approximately 110 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 368 units, which covers roughly 3.3 periods of demand. The reported in-transit inventory of 1619 units is entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory (orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, and P34 are confirmed lost or significantly overdue). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1619 units) from its target base stock, it will continue to order nothing even as on-hand stocks deplete unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset this phantom count. To ensure a safety stock of 2 periods (approx 220 units) and account for the 1619 unit deduction, the target mu_hat needs to be set around 1800-1900. I am increasing mu_hat explicitly to ensure the system places an order soon as on-hand stock is now below the 4-period safety margin.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the system reports 1619 units in-transit, but based on the history, these are all 'phantom' units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, and P34). The actual pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory has depleted to 194 units. With average demand over the last 6 periods around 140 units (increasing from the previous 110-120 range as we enter the holiday season), 194 units will likely only last 1-2 periods. To trigger an order from the OR backend, I must set 'mu_hat' to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (1619) plus the desired base stock. A base stock for (L+1) periods would be ~420 units (140 * 3). Thus, I set mu_hat explicitly to 2040 (1619 + 421) to ensure the backend computes a positive order to replenish stock before a stockout occurs.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory reached 1619 units as of Period 41 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, P34). Demand for late Q4 (Nov/Dec) is showing a slight upward trend, averaging ~140 units/period over the last 3 weeks.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the final weeks of the simulation. Period 43 demand was low at 42, but the underlying late Q4 trend (Nov/Dec) has been higher, averaging ~140 units. We must account for 'phantom' in-transit inventory total of 1619 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, P34), which the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity. The reported in-transit is 1960 units, and the phantom count is 1619, leaving a real active pipeline of 341 units (the order from P43). Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. With 152 units on hand and a target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods (approx 450 units), the OR engine calculation would be: Max(0, 450 - 1960) = 0. To force an order that compensates for upcoming demand plus a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the phantom inventory count (1619) plus the desired real base stock (approx 450), totaling 2069. This ensures the backend produces an order of roughly 100-200 units despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (Dec 16), we are in the late Q4 holiday season. Demand for this jersey basic t-shirt has fluctuated but remains relevant. The primary challenge remains the OR backend's calculation of base stock versus pipeline inventory. The reported in-transit inventory is 2,059 units. Based on historical analysis, 1,619 of these units are 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, P34). The current active pipeline consists of orders from P43 (341 units) and P44 (99 units), totaling 440 units. The OR engine subtracts the full 2,059 units from the calculated base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed when needed, mu_hat must be explicitly set to exceed this 2,059-unit hurdle plus the desired safety stock. Current on-hand is 113. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged (~141+174+42+39)/4 \u2248 100 units/period, but spiked to 174 in P42. Given we are near the end of the simulation (P47), I will maintain high availability while accounting for the phantom inventory logic. I set mu_hat explicitly to (Phantom Inventory + Expected Demand + Safety Buffer) \u2248 1619 + (1.5 * 110) \u2248 1800 to ensure the backend logic triggers sufficient ordering for the final periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December). The product is a T-shirt, which is currently in a low-demand winter regime. Demand over the last 3 periods (P43-P45) has averaged ~44 units, a significant drop from the November average of ~140. On-hand inventory is 404 units, which is ample for the current demand levels. The total in-transit inventory is 1718 units, but 1619 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, P34) are confirmed lost or indefinitey overdue according to carry-over insights. The 'real' active pipeline consists only of Order P44 (99 units from 2 periods ago). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 1718 phantom units from its order calculation, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat at 1850 to cover the 1718 lost units plus a safety buffer for approximately 2-3 periods of current demand (~132 units), ensuring the system does not place unnecessary additional orders while on-hand stock is high.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47 (late December/early January context). Demand has significantly dropped over the last four periods (50, 39, 42, 33), indicating a clear shift away from the mid-Q4 peak. The recent average demand is approximately 41 units/period. The 'Phantom' in-transit inventory remains a massive 1619 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P29, P34). The current reported in-transit is 1718, making the 'real' pipeline only 99 units (from Order P44). With 371 units on-hand and 99 real units in transit, we have 470 'real' units to cover a period where demand is ~41. The OR backend, however, sees 1718 units in transit. To prevent the backend from seeing this 'phantom' stock and refusing to order when needed (though we don't need to order today), we must maintain an inflated mu_hat. However, since we are overstocked relative to current demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 to reflect the current low-demand regime. The base stock calculation will be bypassed by the high on-hand anyway, ensuring no unnecessary order is placed while the system corrects.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 43: Average demand decreased from ~140 to ~41 (-70%) following the holiday peak. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1619 units.
