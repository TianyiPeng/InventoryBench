Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand samples are: 37, 31, 44, 34, 109. There is a significant spike in the most recent week (109 units on 2019-02-04), which likely signals a post-January sales kick-off or a trend shift for this 'Divided Collection' skinny jean. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend calculates the target as (1+L) periods of demand. Given the abrupt jump from a stable mean of ~36 to 109, using all samples would underestimate current demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average of 44, 34, 109 = 62.33) to capture the upward trend while acknowledging the volatility. I will use the default lead time (2) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed in the most recent periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the historical demand for 'Julia Denim RW TRS' (super-skinny 5-pocket jeans), there is a significant jump in demand starting in February. Demand samples: 37, 31, 44, 34 (avg ~36.5) and 109, 112 (avg ~110.5). This suggests a demand regime shift likely linked to early spring seasonal buying or promotional activity. The last two periods show demand tripled compared to January. Inventory is currently 0, and we have 130 units in transit (ordered P1, promised lead time 2, expected arrival P3). I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this new elevated demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=2 specifically targets the high demand seen on 2019-02-04 and 2019-02-11. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 2 as we have no evidence yet of delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-04: baseline demand increased from ~37 to ~110 units/week (+200%).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, 2019. We are observing the 'Divided Collection' skinny jeans, which transitioned to a higher demand regime starting Feb 4th (average ~110). Recent demand samples are 112 (P1) and 81 (P2), confirming this higher level compared to Jan (~39). Lead time is promised at 2 periods. The order from P1 (130 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P4), and the order from P2 (114 units) during P4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 244 in-transit. Because our inventory is 0 and we have consecutive stockouts (0 sold vs 193 demand in P1-P2), we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of the new demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (N=3 includes the jump on 2019-02-04 and the P1/P2 samples) to stabilize the forecast around the ~100 level, and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this higher regime. L is kept at default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a staple denim item (Julia Denim RW TRS). We are currently in a stock-out situation with 0 on-hand inventory, despite high demand. Historical demand samples showed a baseline shift on 2019-02-04 (109 units), followed by consistent demand in Periods 1-3 (112, 81, 52). The average demand over the last 4 weeks is approx 88.5 units. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (130 units) are expected to arrive during the current period (Period 4) and will be visible in the next Period 5 conclude message. Total in-transit inventory is 302 units, which covers nearly 3.4 periods of recent average demand. To stabilize the OR backend, I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime since February, while keeping L at default (2) as we haven't confirmed any lead-time deviations yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The carry-over insight noted a demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04, where demand increased from ~37 to ~110 units/week. Since that shift, the observed demand values (including Period 1-4) are: 112, 81, 52, 79. The average of these 4 periods is 81.0. While lower than the initial spike of 109/112, it is consistently higher than the pre-Feb baseline. The promised lead time is 2, and the 'Period 4 conclude' message confirms an actual lead time of 2 periods (P2 order arrived during P4). However, the P1 order (130 units) has not yet 'concluded' after its expected 2-period lead time. This suggests the P1 order may be lost or significantly delayed. On-hand is 35, and in-transit is 188 (comprised of the 'missing' P1 order of 130 and the P3 order of 58). If the P1 order is indeed lost, the physical pipeline is only 58. By using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, I align the forecast with the post-spike demand levels. I will use 'calculate' for L to stay grounded in the observed lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lost shipment for Period 1 order (130 units) as it remains in-transit 4 periods after ordering with a promised lead time of 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18, 2019. Demand for 'Julia Denim' has stabilized into a new regime since early February. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 79.8 (112, 81, 52, 79, 75). However, significant delivery issues are present. The Period 1 order (130 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, confirming it as a lost shipment. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2). The Period 3 order (58 units) is currently 3 periods old and overdue. The Period 5 order is 1 period old. On-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the lost Period 1 order and the likely delay/loss of Period 3, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the pipeline requirement. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~80 units per week. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. This approach forces the OR backend to raise the base stock level to cover the inventory gap caused by missing stock and sustained demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed loss of Period 1 shipment (130 units), missing for 5 periods. Demand regime since Feb 11 settled at mean ~80 units/week.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the current state shows on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 weeks has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 81 units/week (81, 52, 79, 75, 78). The shipment from Period 1 (130 units) is confirmed lost, and the Period 3 shipment (58 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered on Period 3, now at the start of Period 7), indicating potential loss or severe delay. Excluding the pre-Feb 4th data, the current demand regime mean is roughly 75-80. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this 'Divided Collection' denim demand accurately. For the lead time L, although a 1-period arrival occurred once, the promised lead time is 2 and the Period 3 shipment is missing; I will use default (2) to maintain a safety buffer against shipment instability. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 5 periods to capture the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Shipment ordered in Period 3 (58 units) is likely lost or severely delayed (4 periods since order, promised 2). Only 2 of the first 5 orders placed have successfully arrived.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains consistent within the current regime (mean ~80 units/week). Reviewing the logistics: the Period 1 order (130 units) and Period 3 order (58 units) are confirmed lost/severely delayed. The Period 6 order (112 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 8 (promised L=2). However, recent observed lead times are erratic (L=2 for P2 shipment, L=1 for P5 shipment). To ensure we bridge the gap created by lost shipments and maintain service levels for the next 3 weeks (L+1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 samples (Period 2 to Period 7), where demand has stabilized around 77.3 units/week with a standard deviation of approx 12. Using recent_N=6 captures this specific regime while ignoring the initial spike. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed delivery speed (averaging 1.5 periods), which will influence the internal base-stock formula.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Supply chain instability confirmed; 2/6 historical orders (P1, P3) lost. Logistics reliability is currently ~66%. Demand regime is stable at ~80 units/week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Demand for the product (superstretch washed denim jeans) has been relatively stable since February 11, with an average of approximately 84 units per week over the last 8 periods (excluding the outlier jump in early Feb). However, supply chain reliability is a major concern: orders from P1 (130 units) and P3 (58 units) are now 8 and 6 periods old respectively, and since the promised lead time is 2, these are classified as lost. The backend OR logic counts these lost units as 'in-transit', which would prevent it from ordering enough to cover future demand. In Period 8, we saw a demand of 110, leaving us with only 2 units on-hand. We have 188 units 'in-transit', but most are lost. To compensate for the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) period demand plus a buffer to recover from the stockout caused by losses. L is set to a calculated average based on successful deliveries (P4:2, P6:1, P8:2, Avg=1.67), but I will use L=2 (promised) as a conservative baseline for lead-time mean calculations while inflating mu_hat to trigger an order despite the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain loss rate updated: 33% of orders (P1, P3) confirmed lost. Demand regime for Julia Denim RW TRS stable at ~84 units/week (last 8 samples mean).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia Denim RW TRS' (super-skinny jeans) shows a stable demand regime since early Feb. The current period date is April 15. The historical mean demand over the last 9 weeks (excluding the initial outlier period) is approximately 86 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: orders from Period 1 (130 units), Period 3 (58 units), and now potentially Period 7/8 (though zero orders were placed then) or earlier are lost. We see that orders from P2, P5, and P6 arrived correctly. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. There are 367 units 'In-transit', but we must assume that the units from P1 (130) and P3 (58) are permanently lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only 179 units (from P9). Given the 2-period promised lead time, we need to cover demand for periods 10, 11, and 12 (L+1). With demand ~86, total target is ~258. Since the only viable pipeline is 179, the OR backend needs to order to close this gap. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stability and calculate for L, but I will explicitly set sigma_hat to account for the high variability caused by recent demand swings (72-110).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia Denim RW TRS' (554450019) is currently in a stable demand regime after an initial spike in early February. Since Period 2 (Feb 18), the average demand has been approximately 80 units per week. Although the demand was higher in early April (110 units), the last two periods have shown lower demand (72 and 61 units). Supply chain reliability remains a concern, as orders from P1 and P3 were lost, though the most recent order (P9) arrived in just 1 period, suggesting variable lead times. With an on-hand inventory of 118 and zero pipeline inventory (as the P9 order for 179 units just arrived), we need to ensure we can cover demand for the next 'L+1' periods. To capture the recent moderation in demand while protecting against shortages due to supply instability (loss rate ~33%), I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (mean ~80). I will use 'L=3' as an explicit estimate to account for both the promised lead time and the high probability of shipment failure/delays observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: while promised L=2, recent shipments arrived in 1 period (P5, P9) while others (P1, P3) were lost. Effective lead time for planning should buffer against potential losses.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-29. Historical demand for SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim) has stabilized at a lower mean recently. Over the last three weeks, demand has dropped (72, 61, 49) following a period of higher demand (averaging ~80-100). The mean for the last 5 samples is 74.2. Current on-hand is 69 with 210 in-transit. Shipments from P1 and P3 are definitely lost. Recent successful shipments (P5, P6, P9) arrived in 1-2 periods. I am setting L=2 (promised) to be conservative given past losses. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the early-year spike while reflecting the recent cooling trend (avg ~75 over the last 8 weeks is ~84, but the last 3-4 weeks suggest a downward trend). Sigma_hat will use N=8 to account for the volatility seen in March/April.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression detected: post-February surge, demand has trended downward from ~85 units/week in March to ~55 units/week in late April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), the Julia Denim product is experiencing a clear demand decline from its Feb-March peak. Demand has dropped from ~80 units/week to approximately 47-49 units/week over the last two periods. Historical samples confirm this downward trend (112, 81, 52, 79, 75, 78, 89, 110, 72, 61, 49, 47). I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower-demand regime (mean ~57). Regarding supply chain, there is a significant risk of loss: 188 units (P1: 130, P3: 58) are confirmed lost, while 210 units are technically 'in-transit'. The 210 units in-transit includes the P9 order (179 units reported as arrived in P10, but the transit tally might still be reflecting old lost orders or the P11 order of 22). Given Profit=HoldingCost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the engine will target the median demand. I will use L=explicit value of 3 to provide a buffer against the high loss rate (approx 33%) and variability observed in previous periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression continues: May baseline forecast adjusted to ~50 units/week based on the last 3 periods (61, 49, 47).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450019' is currently experiencing a stock-out (on-hand: 0) after Period 13 demand (60) exceeded starting inventory (44). Recent demand shows a regression from earlier peaks: the last four weeks recorded 49, 47, and 60 units. While the carry-over insight noted a downward trend to 50, the recent spike to 60 suggests a stabilization around 50-55. The in-transit inventory is 188 units, which includes historical lost shipments (P1: 130, P3: 58). Excluding these lost units, the 'real' pipeline is essentially zero as the P11 order arrived in P13. To reset the stock position, I will use recent trends for demand planning. I choose N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (avg ~54) and use explicit lead time L=2 to reflect the promised window, as reliability is compromised. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=4 will capture current volatility (std ~6) to avoid over-ordering given high holding costs ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in May: mean demand for last 3 periods is ~52 units/week, up slightly from the April low and indicating a plateau in the regression.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia Denim RW TRS' is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). Recent demand history shows a stabilization in May with values of 60 and 47 (mean ~53.5). The earlier regression from late April appears to have plateaued. Supply chain reliability is a concern, with 33% of historical orders lost (P1, P3), though recent shipments (P9, P11) have arrived with lead times of 1 and 2 periods respectively. I am setting L=2 (promised) as it remains the most frequent successful arrival time. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N=4 (covering the last 4 periods) to capture the current plateau (~53 units/week) while ignoring the higher volatility from March/April. This gives a mu_hat calculation based on (1+L)*53.5. Due to the high stockout risk seen in Period 14 and the history of lost shipments, I will use a slightly higher N for sigma to buffer against demand variance.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of 2019/5/27, the product is currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The order history shows that orders from Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (58 units) are lost, as they have been in-transit for 15 and 13 periods respectively, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2. These 188 units in 'In-transit' are phantom inventory and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock; therefore, to trigger a new order, I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly to offset this phantom pipeline. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of 52 units/week (last 3 periods: 60, 47, 51). I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) plus the 188 phantom units (52 * 3 + 188 = 344) to force the backend to place an order that replenishes stock. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to provide a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory confirmed: 188 units (P1: 130, P3: 58) are permanently lost. As long as these units remain in the system's 'In-transit' count, mu_hat must be manually inflated by 188 to trigger any replenishment orders.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450019' has entered a stable early-summer demand regime with a mean of approximately 50-55 units per week (last 3 periods: 47, 51, 49). However, a critical backend issue exists: there is 188 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P1 and P3) that remain in the 'In-transit' count. Total In-transit is currently 332, consisting of 188 (phantom) + 144 (ordered in P16). To trigger any replenishment from the capped base-stock policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)], mu_hat must be significantly inflated. If mu_hat is not high enough to exceed the 332-unit threshold, the system will not order despite 0 on-hand inventory. Given a lead time of 2, the total pipeline coverage needs to target demand for periods 17, 18, and 19. A 'safe' target is roughly 150-180 units of real stock. Adding the 188 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 360 to ensure the policy overcomes the pipeline block and places a safety order. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Julia Denim RW TRS' has further decreased, with the last sample at 37, continuing a downward trend from the May stabilized mean of ~50. I will adjust the mu_hat forecast down to a baseline of 45 units/period based on the most recent 3-period trend (51, 49, 37). A major challenge remains: there is 188 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders P1 and P3) that are confirmed lost but still occupy the backend's 'In-transit' count. To trigger any replenishment order, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset these lost units. Under the base stock policy [Order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)], I must set mu_hat = (45 * (1 + L)) + 188. With L=2, the required mu_hat is 135 + 188 = 323. I maintain L at 2 to provide a safety buffer despite some recent 1-period arrivals, as earlier shipments were late or lost. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression continued into June; baseline demand shifted from ~50 to ~45 units/week (-10%).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for Julia Denim trousers has continued to decline throughout June, with the most recent demand sample at 28 units, following a trend of 49 and 37 in previous periods. The mean of the last 3 periods is approximately 38 units/week. Per 'Carry-over Insights', there are 188 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1 and P3) that are permanently lost but still included in the system's in-transit count (In-transit: 216 total = 188 lost + 28 from P17). Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, and pipeline_inventory includes these 188 lost units, no new orders will be triggered unless mu_hat is manually inflated. To compensate, I set mu_hat to (1+L) * demand_forecast + 188. With L=2 and a forecast of 38, mu_hat = (3 * 38) + 188 = 302. This inflation tricks the logic into ordering despite the phantom 'in-transit' units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the high-demand period in February.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Julia Denim RW TRS' has undergone a significant regression from its peak in early 2019 (~110 units) to a current stable mean of approximately 33 units/week over the last three periods (37, 28, 34). There is a critical accounting issue: 188 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are permanently lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 223 - Latest orders: 28 + 7 = 35 units actually arriving; thus 188 units are 'phantom'). Because the OR backend subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to bypass this. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Desired Base Stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) at a mean of 33 units is ~100. Adding 188 units of phantom inventory requires mu_hat to be ~288. I will set mu_hat to 323 to provide a buffer for the recent demand volatility and the high lost-shipment rate, ensuring the order calculation (Base Stock - 223) results in a positive replenishment to cover the current 45 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Current demand baseline (June) is stable at ~33 units/week. Inventory accounting remains distorted by 188 lost units (P1, P3) in the pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Demand for this item (superstretch 5-pocket jeans) has steadily declined from its February peak (~110) to a current June/July baseline of approximately 30-35 units/week. Specifically, June demand was [37, 28, 34, 15], averaging 28.5 units. The phantom inventory issue persists: 188 units (P1: 130, P3: 58) are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline count (In-transit: 278). The active pipeline is only 90 units (P17: 28, P19: 7, P20: 55). To bypass the OR engine's capped policy and ensure replenishment despite the 188-unit phantom inflation, I must manually inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of ~30 units, plus safety stock. This results in a target inventory of ~120-130 units. Adding the 188 units of phantom inventory requires a total perceived availability of ~310. Using L=2, the backend computes mu_hat as (1+L)*mean. To reach a base stock roughly equal to (effective_pipeline + phantom + on_hand), I set mu_hat explicitly to the current regime average (~30) plus the phantom offset divided by (1+L). Calculation: (30 + 188/3) * 3 \u2248 279. I will set mu_hat to 300 to maintain availability as newer orders arrive and the P17 and P19 orders (35 units) likely arrive this period or next.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450019' is currently affected by a significant data integrity issue: 188 units (P1: 130, P3: 58) are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline inventory count. To trigger any replenishment order, mu_hat must be manually inflated by this phantom inventory amount. Current demand for July is stable but low, averaging ~20 units/week over the last two periods (15, 25). Looking at the seasonal trend, the garment (superstretch denim skinny jeans) is likely in a summer trough. I am setting the baseline forecast at 25 units/week. Therefore, mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Phantom Inventory = (1 + 2) * 25 + 188 = 263. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals are variable (1 to 2 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the lower volatility in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough confirmed for July: baseline mean reduced to ~25 units/week. Phantom inventory correction of +188 units remains necessary for all mu_hat calculations.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Julia Denim RW TRS' has settled into a mid-summer trough, averaging approximately 18 units/week over the last three periods (15, 25, 15). The 'In-transit' count of 223 units contains 188 'phantom' units (Period 1: 130, Period 3: 58) that are confirmed lost but still occupy pipeline space in the OR backend's logic. Because the backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline is artificially inflated by 188, the system will not place new orders unless the target base_stock exceeds 188. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + 188). With a current weekly mean (\u03bc) of 18 and lead time (L) of 2, the base stock (\u03bc * (L+1)) should be 54. Adding the 188 unit correction yields 242. Sigma_hat is kept at a default level as demand volatility is secondary to the inventory accounting error.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a July trough, averaging ~18 units/week. All OR parameter decisions continue to require a +188 unit buffer on mu_hat to overcome the permanent pipeline distortion from lost shipments P1 and P3.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is a seasonal low period for '5-pocket jeans' in the Divided Collection. Demand for the last 4 periods has been 15, 25, 15, and 10, confirming a baseline mean of approximately 16 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently 223 units, but 188 of those are confirmed lost (Period 1: 130, Period 3: 58). To ensure the OR backend triggers a purchase, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) period plus the 188-unit phantom loss. With L=2, the expected demand for 3 periods is ~48 units (16 * 3). Adding the 188-unit distortion leads to a mu_hat of ~236. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-volatility trough, which will help keep safety stock lean while we wait for seasonal recovery later in Q3/Q4.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Julia Denim RW TRS' is currently in a seasonal trough, with the last four periods showing values of 15, 25, 15, 10, and 10 (mean = 15). The system is heavily distorted by 188 units of phantom inventory from lost shipments in Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (58 units), which prevents the OR backend from triggering replenishment because the backend believes the 'In-transit' quantity is 223 (35 real + 188 phantom). To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * \u03bc + 188. With a promised lead time L=2 and a current demand baseline of 15, the expected demand over (1+L) periods is 45. Adding the 188-unit correction, mu_hat is set to 233. This ensures that the base stock (233) exceeds the pipeline (223) + on-hand (25), triggering a small replenishment or maintaining safety levels. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * 7.5 based on recent low-demand volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August 2019. Demand for Julia Denim RW TRS has reached a seasonal trough in July, averaging approximately 11-12 units per week over the last three periods (P23-P25: 10, 10, 11). The system's 'In-transit' count of 223 units contains 188 phantom units from lost orders P1 (130) and P3 (58) that will never arrive. The remaining 35 units in transit are likely P19 (7 units) and P20 (which partially arrived or had delayed reporting), but given the low demand, the focus is on overcoming the 188-unit pipeline distortion. To trigger any order,mu_hat must exceed the perceived pipeline of 223. However, with 14 units on hand and demand at ~11/week, no immediate order is needed as current stock covers the expected lead time. I will maintain an explicit mu_hat forecast that accounts for the phantom inventory: (Mean Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units = (11 * 3) + 188 = 221. This ensures that when stock levels truly drop, the backend policy (Order = base_stock - pipeline) will respond correctly. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value to reflect the current stability of the demand trough.

Carry-over insight: August demand baseline is holding at ~11 units/week, maintaining the stable low-demand trough observed in July.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 12, 2019. Demand for 'Julia Denim RW TRS' remains in a seasonal low trough, with the last four samples being 10, 10, 11, and 12 units/week (mean ~11). On-hand inventory is 2 units. The 'In-transit' count is 223 units, but 188 of these (from Period 1 and Period 3) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. This leaves 35 units actually in-transit (ordered in P19 and P20, though P19 should have arrived; P20 arrived in P22, but the backend still reflects 223 total). Due to the system's logic (order = base_stock - pipeline), the OR engine will never place an order as long as the pipeline is inflated by 188 phantom units. To force a replenishment, mu_hat must be set to at least the sum of the phantom inventory plus 1-2 periods of expected demand. However, current on-hand (2) + actual in-transit (0 confirmed valid upcoming) is low. I will set mu_hat to 223 (phantom total) + 33 (3 weeks of demand at ~11/week) to trigger a small replenishment to cover the current trough. L is set to calculate and sigma to recent_N=5 to capture low volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-19). Demand for Julia Denim trousers has been in a sustained seasonal trough throughout July and August, averaging approximately 11-13 units/week (excluding the Period 27 spike which may be an outlier or noise). The logistics situation remains the primary challenge: 188 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are confirmably lost and permanently stuck in the 'In-transit' accounting (Phantom Inventory). With an 'In-transit' count of 254 units and 'On-hand' 0, the OR backend's baseline logic (order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)) will erroneously assume we are overstocked and never order until these 188 units are accounted for. To force the system to replenish based on actual expected physical inventory of 66 units (254 - 188), I must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter. Using the recent 3-period demand mean (~14 units/week), a typical 3-period demand window (L+1) would be 42 units. I will add the 188 'phantom' units to this base, resulting in a mu_hat of 230. This ensures the backend recognizes we only have enough stock for physical coverage and triggers small replenishment orders as needed. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the lower volatility of the current low-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand for 'Julia Denim RW TRS' has shown a slight uptick to ~21 units/week over the last two periods (P27: 20, P28: 23) compared to the July/early-August trough of ~11 units/week. This may signal the start of a seasonal transition into autumn. Total In-transit inventory is 254 units, but this includes 188 units confirmed lost in Periods 1 and 3 (130 + 58). To account for this 'phantom inventory' and enable the OR backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be manually inflated. Using the recent demand average of ~20 units/week for 3 periods (L+1) gives a baseline of 60. Adding the 188-unit distortion leads to an explicit mu_hat of 248. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to protect against the moderate volatility seen during this transition. Lead time 'calculate' remains appropriate as arrivals have mostly followed a 1-2 period window when not lost.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand uptick detected: average increased from ~11 to ~21 units/week (+90%) over the last 2 periods, suggesting a possible shift out of the summer trough.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim RW TRS) is exiting the summer low-demand trough. Demand has increased from a baseline of ~11 units/week to ~21 units/week over the last three periods (20, 23, 21). The system continues to report a phantom 'In-transit' quantity of 188 units from lost orders in Period 1 (130) and Period 3 (58). Current reported 'In-transit' is 254 units, which realistically consists of these 188 phantom units, the Period 19 order (7 units, overdue/lost), the Period 20 order (55 units - wait, P20 arrived in P22), the Period 27 order (31 units), and perhaps the small orders from P17/P19. Specifically, In-transit (254) = P1(130) + P3(58) + P19(7) + P27(31) + others. To trigger any replenishment from the OR backend, mu_hat must be manually set to a value that exceeds the reported pipeline. Given current demand (~21/week) and L+1=3, required stock is ~63. To overcome the 188 phantom units and some buffer, I will set mu_hat to 188 + (3 * 25) = 263. This ensures the backend sees a need for stock despite the accounting error. sigma_hat is set to cover the moderate volatility seen during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery: Baseline demand has moved from ~11 units/week to ~21 units/week (+90%) as of late August.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim RW TRS) is entering September, which historically showed a demand recovery from the summer trough. Recent demand (last 4 periods: 20, 23, 21, 31) confirms a shift from a mean of ~11 units/week to ~24 units/week. Lead times are inconsistent (Period 27 order took 3 periods). Critically, there are 188 units in the 'In-transit' count (Period 1: 130, Period 3: 58) that are permanently lost. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + 188). I will use an explicit mu_hat calculation: (1 + L) * average_demand + 188. L = 3 (recent observation). Recent mean demand is 24 units. Forecasted Base Stock = (1+3)*24 = 96. Total mu_hat = 96 + 188 = 284. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for supply chain and demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed September recovery: Demand mean shifted from ~11 to ~24 units/week (+118%) over the last 4 weeks. Lead time for Period 27 order was 3 periods, suggesting continued supply chain friction.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/9/16. In Period 31, there was a massive demand spike to 177 units (up from ~24 units), likely signaling the start of a major seasonal trend (e.g., Back-to-School or Fall collection launch for Julia Denim RW TRS). The pipeline inventory of 284 units is heavily distorted by 188 permanently lost units (P1: 130, P3: 58) that remain 'In-transit'. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be adjusted to account for these phantoms. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for demand to capture the recovery trend but manually set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the 188-unit buffer plus a forecast for the new demand regime. I estimate forward demand at ~100 units/week given the 177-unit spike and previous September trends. Thus, (1+L)*100 + 188 = 3*100 + 188 = 488. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent drift to L=3.

Carry-over insight: Massive seasonal demand spike confirmed Period 31 (177 units); baseline transitioning from ~24 to >100 units/week. Phantom inventory (188 units) still requires manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand seasonal recovery (September). Demand spiked to 177 in Period 31 and remained high at 97 in Period 32. Current on-hand is 0 with 427 units in-transit. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure contains 188 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 239 units. To compensate for this 188-unit 'phantom inventory' and ensure the OR backend places orders despite the inflated pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime at ~120 units/week (averaging the recent spike). For a lead time of 2, the required base stock is (1+L) * demand = 3 * 120 = 360. Adding the 188-unit buffer to override the lost shipments results in a mu_hat of 548. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 50 to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal peak confirmed: Demand spiked from ~24 to average ~137 units/week over the last 2 periods. Supply chain remains erratic with lead times of 1-3 periods observed recently.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia Denim RW TRS' is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge typical for late September/early October. Demand in the last three periods has been 177, 97, and 331, indicating a clear regime shift to a high-demand state. The average demand over the last three weeks is approximately 201 units. However, we must continue to account for the 188 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P1 and P3) that remain in the 'In-transit' count, which would otherwise prevent the OR backend from ordering. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Calculating mu_hat: Based on a lead time (L) of 2, the window is (1+L) = 3 periods. With a forecast of ~230 units/week for this peak, mu_hat should be (3 * 230) + 188 = 878. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the extreme volatility (std of last 3 samples is ~120, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~207). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect recent variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: September/October seasonal peak intensity confirmed: Demand exceeded 330 units in P33. Previous phantom inventory correction (+188) is still required to bypass the pipeline distortion caused by unrecorded losses of P1 and P3.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant seasonal demand peak for 'Julia Denim' trousers that began in early September. Demand in the last four periods has been 177, 97, 331, and 110. While the most recent sample was a drop to 110, the overall mean for this high-demand regime is approximately 178 units/week. The logistics system continues to show phantom inventory: 188 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are permanently lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' total (878 units). Total actual in-transit inventory is 878 - 188 = 690. To trigger the OR backend to order correctly despite this 188-unit pipeline distortion, I must manually inflate mu_hat. For Period 35, I estimate base demand at 150 units/week (conservative average of the peak). Using the (1+L) formula with L=2, expected demand across lead time is 450 units. Adding the 188-unit phantom correction results in an explicit mu_hat of 638. Sigma set to 150 to reflect high volatility during seasonal spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher for October peak; though volatile, mean is ~150-170 units/week. Phantom inventory distortion (188 units) remains a persistent requirement for mu_hat inflation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim) is in a significant October seasonal peak. Recent demand samples show high volume and volatility (P31: 177, P33: 331, P34: 110, P35: 102). A mean demand of ~180 units/week is estimated for the peak window. There is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue where 188 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 674, Actual expected: 486). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 188 phantom units. The base target for (1+L) periods (where L=2, so 3 weeks) is 180 * 3 = 540 units. Adding the 188 unit correction results in an explicit mu_hat of 728. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend utilize historical arrivals while maintaining a standard L estimate.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim RW TRS) is currently in a high-demand seasonal peak (September/October), though demand has moderated from its late September high (331 units) to a more manageable range (52-102 units in the last two weeks). The system has a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: 188 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 553, of which 188 are dead units). To trigger the OR backend to order correctly, mu_hat must be manually inflated by 188 to offset this 'pipeline_inventory' distortion. Lead times are also erratic, appearing as 3 periods recently (P32, P33). I am setting L=2 (promised) but calculating mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (last 6 periods average \u2248 145) plus the 188-unit offset = 333. For sigma_hat, I'm using the last 6 periods to capture the recent high volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the post-September/early-October seasonal peak for trousers. Demand has normalized from the >300 units/week spike to approximately 50-60 units/week over the last two periods (52, 56). However, the system's pipeline inventory is significantly distorted by 188 units from Periods 1 and 3 that were never delivered but remain 'In-transit'. To trigger replenishment in the OR backend (which subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock), mu_hat must be manually inflated. Based on the recent stabilization, I am setting the base forecast to ~55 units/week. Adjusted mu_hat = (1+L) * 55 + 188 = (1+2)*55 + 188 = 165 + 188 = 353. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will use an explicit L of 2 to mirror the promised lead time while accounting for recent arrivals (P32 and P33 arrived in 3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20% of the weekly demand mean scaled for (L+1), ensuring a buffer against the high volatility seen in this category.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Oct 14 - Oct 21 demand has settled at ~55 units/week, down from the Sep/Oct peak of >150 units/week. Supply chain lead time remains volatile at 2-3 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the Sep/Oct seasonal peak ($>150$ units/week) to a post-peak stabilization regime. The last three periods recorded demands of 52, 56, and 90, averaging ~66 units/week. However, the most recent demand (90) suggests either residual volatility or a slightly higher stabilization floor than the previous 55 estimate. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this post-peak behavior (mean ~75). Supply chain lead times remain volatile (recent arrivals at 3 periods), so I will use an explicit L of 3 to ensure sufficient coverage. A critical known issue is 'Phantom Inventory': 188 units from Period 1 and 3 are lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 553, but 188 are dead). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit from the base stock. To force the engine to place an order when needed, mu_hat must be manually inflated. Here, (1+L) * mean + 188 = (1+3) * 75 + 188 = 488. I will set mu_hat to 488 explicitly to bypass this pipeline distortion and signal the backend to maintain a buffer around the stabilized demand floor.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak stabilization mean (mid-Oct to Nov) detected at ~75 units/week. Phantom inventory distortion of 188 units continues to necessitate manual mu_hat inflation to trigger replenishment.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand regime has transitioned from the Sep/Oct peak to a post-peak stabilization level. Demand in the last four periods was 52, 56, 90, and 49, averaging ~62 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 553 units includes 188 units from early periods (P1: 130, P3: 58) that are confirmed lost. This 'phantom inventory' distorts the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline), making it think there is more stock than actually exists. To trigger the necessary replenishment of approximately 62 units/week, mu_hat must be adjusted to account for this 188-unit gap. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead time (averaging ~2-3 periods recently). For mu_hat, I am using the 'explicit' method with a value of 374, derived as [(1 + L=2) * (mean demand 62)] + 188 phantom units = 186 + 188 = 374. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to account for recent demand volatility (range 49-90).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization mean (Oct-Nov) refined to ~62 units/week. Phantom inventory distortion remains constant at 188 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has stabilized post-September/October peak, settling into a November mean of approximately 62 units/week based on the last four periods (56, 90, 49, 44). The supply chain remains erratic with lead times of 2-3 periods. Crucially, 188 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 553, true pending arrivals: 365 from P34). Because the OR backend's capped policy calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', these 188 'phantom' units prevent the system from ordering. To bypass this, I must manually inflate mu_hat by 188 units. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) accounts for the missing units. I will use the recent mean of 62 units/week over 3 periods (L+1) plus the 188-unit correction, totaling 374 for mu_hat. Sigma_hat is set to reflect current volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450019 (Julia Denim RW TRS) is currently in a post-peak period (late November). Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization at a mean of approximately 50-60 units per week over the last 4-5 periods (49, 44, 35, and recent others). However, the primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' distortion. There are 188 units (from Period 1 and Period 3 orders) that are permanently lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 553, of which 188 are noise). To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset this 188-unit distortion. Furthermore, recent arrivals (P32, P33) confirmed lead times of 3 periods, suggesting a safer L estimate of 3. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' by taking the forecast for (L+1) periods (approx 4 * 60 = 240) and adding the 188-unit phantom correction, totaling 428. This should allow the cap logic to trigger a necessary order given the current on-hand inventory of 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand stabilization confirmed for late November at ~43 units/week (last 3 periods mean). Phantom inventory correction (+188 units) remains critical for order triggering.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand has shifted from the autumn peak to a more stable late-year baseline. Over the last 4 periods (P39-P42), demand was 49, 44, 35, and 91 (mean ~55). However, the last period (P42) saw a spike to 91, which may be related to late November sales (Black Friday/Cyber Monday context). Excluding the spike, the baseline remains around 45-50. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this post-peak stabilization while respecting the recent volatility. 

Crucially, the 'In-transit' quantity includes 188 units from Periods 1 and 3 that were confirmed lost months ago. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will count these 188 phantom units as available, preventing any new orders until they are 'exhausted'. Since on-hand is currently 0 and genuine in-transit (P34 order of 330 units) is overdue (ordered P34, now P43, L=9+), I must ensure mu_hat is sufficiently high to overcome this (188 lost + 330 delayed) 518-unit pipeline distortion. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to the current expected demand over the lead time (3 * ~55 = 165) plus the 518 phantom/delayed units to trigger a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: December baseline demand is established at ~55 units/week. Supply chain remains highly unreliable with the Period 34 order (330 units) now 9 periods old and likely lost or severely delayed, increasing the total pipeline distortion from 188 to 518 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Demand for the last 5 periods has been [49, 44, 35, 91, 22], averaging ~48 units/week, consistent with a post-peak stabilization regime in the ~45-55 range. The primary challenge remains the distorted pipeline inventory. As of Period 44, there are 683 units 'in-transit'. Based on history, these include: P1 (130 lost), P3 (58 lost), and P34 (330 lost/severely delayed, ordered 10 weeks ago with a promised L=2). This totals 518 units of 'phantom inventory' that the backend believes will arrive but likely never will. To trigger replenishment, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset these 518 units. I will use the recent mean (48) and apply the inflation: (1+L)*48 + 518. For L=2, this is 3*48 + 518 = 144 + 518 = 662. For sigma_hat, I use the recent standard deviation over the last 5 periods (~27) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom inventory distortion increased to 518 units due to the confirmed loss/extreme delay of the Period 34 shipment (330 units), which is now 10 periods overdue. All replenishment calculations must add 518 to mu_hat to overcome this pipeline bias.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December. Demand has dropped significantly in the last two weeks (22, 14 units) following a late November spike. The most recent 3-period demand average is approximately 42 units/week. However, the system is suffering from a massive 'phantom inventory' distortion. The in-transit count of 683 units includes three likely lost or severely delayed shipments: P1 (130 units), P3 (58 units), and P34 (330 units), totaling 518 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (683) from the target base stock, it will not place any orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated by this 518-unit distortion. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered for the (L+1) window, I calculate the target using the current baseline (~42 units * 3 periods = 126) and add the 518-unit buffer, resulting in a mu_hat of 644. I set L to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, and sigma_hat explicitly at 100 to provide a safety buffer against the high volatility observed in late Q4.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450019 is experiencing a significant demand regression in late December, with the last 3 samples averaging ~17 units per week (22, 14, 16), down from the November average of ~60. The supply chain has a major accounting distortion: the 'In-transit' count of 553 includes 518 units from lost or severely overdue shipments (P1=130, P3=58, P34=330). To trigger any replenishment from the OR backend, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset this 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Current on-hand is 114, which covers nearly 7 weeks of current demand. However, given the year-end date (Dec 23), I anticipate a potential January sales uptick or stabilization. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the 518-unit phantom correction plus a forecast of ~25 units/week for 3 periods (L+1), totaling 518 + 75 = 593. Sigma_hat is set based on recent variability to maintain a reasonable safety buffer.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the September/October seasonal peak (>150 units/week) to a much lower year-end/winter regime (~15-20 units/week over the last 3 periods: 14, 16, 19). The primary challenge continues to be the massive 'phantom inventory' distortion in the OR backend's calculation. There are currently 553 units listed as 'In-transit', but 518 of these are almost certainly lost (P1: 130, P3: 58, P34: 330). Because the OR backend subtracts all pipeline inventory from its target base stock, it will never place an order as long as it thinks 553 units are coming. To force the system to consider placing orders, mu_hat must be manually inflated by the lost quantity (518 units). Given the current demand is very low (~20 units/week), and on-hand is 95, no immediate order is needed, but the parameters must be set to correctly reflect the true state for when stock depletes. I will set mu_hat to (Avg Demand * (1+L)) + 518. With L=2 and Avg Demand=20, mu_hat = (20 * 3) + 518 = 578.
