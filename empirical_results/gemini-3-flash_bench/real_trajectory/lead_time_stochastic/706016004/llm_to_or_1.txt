Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a wardrobe staple (jeans), but the initial historical samples show an upward trend: [1, 6, 7, 3, 15]. The most recent demand (15) is significantly higher than the average. Considering retailers often start seeing spring inventory movement in February, I will prioritize recent demand. Promised lead time is 2, so the safety stock coverage window is 3 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent lift in demand while maintaining responsiveness to the high variability observed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch denim trouser. Initial demand in Period 1 was 57 units, which significantly exceeds the initial historical samples (averaging ~6.4). This suggests a strong launch or early-spring seasonal spike for this denim style. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (19 units) has a promised lead time of 2 periods and is not expected to arrive until Period 3. Our goal is to set parameters that capture this new high-demand regime while maintaining the standard lead time of 2. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to include the recent spike of 57 plus the three most recent historical samples (15, 3, 7) to start smoothing the estimate without overreacting or underestimating. L remains at the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: demand spiked to 57 units, significantly above the previous historical mean of ~6.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016004' (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is experiencing a massive demand regime shift. Historical mean demand was ~6, but recent periods show 57 and 72 units. The current date is February 25, which coincides with the transition into Spring fashion seasonality, justifying this surge. On-hand inventory is currently 0, causing lost sales. Pipeline inventory is 81 units (19 from P1, 62 from P2). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and become visible in the P4 start observation. Since we have not yet observed any completed lead times, I will stick with the default 'L' (2 periods). I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (Mean ~64.5) while filtering out the low historical baseline. This will raise the base stock level to satisfy the current trend and minimize backlogs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~6 to ~65 (+900%) starting Feb 2019, likely driven by Spring fashion seasonality.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is experiencing a significant demand surge (mean of last 3 periods is ~64.3) compared to historical data (avg ~6). This is consistent with Spring fashion seasonality for high-waisted denim. On-hand inventory is 0 due to 100% stockouts; we are entirely reliant on the pipeline (163 units). Using the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE': the order placed in Period 1 (19 units, promised L=2) should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in 'Period 3 conclude'. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the lead time + the current period's demand (L+1), I will set L to 3 (explicit). I will use the recent 3 samples (since the regime shift in Feb) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the pre-Feb data is no longer relevant for the current seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Lead time potential drift: Period 1 order (L=2) did not arrive by end of Period 3, suggesting actual L >= 3 or delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is experiencing a significant demand surge peaking in early March (Period 4 demand was 92), far exceeding the initial historical mean of ~6. Previous carry-over insights suggested a lead time drift, but the Period 4 conclude message shows the Period 2 order (62 units) arrived with L=2, confirming the promised lead time remains accurate. However, the Period 1 order (19 units) has not arrived and is now 1 period overdue (should have arrived in Period 3). I will treat the Period 1 order as a likely lost shipment and rely on the confirmed L=2 for upcoming inventory. Since demand is trending upwards (57 -> 72 -> 64 -> 92), I will use the last 4 samples (the high-demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock that accounts for recent volatility and growth. With on-hand currently at 0 and 178 units in-transit (excluding the likely lost 19 units), significant new orders are needed to satisfy the 3-period coverage (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time L=2 confirmed (P2 order arrived P4); P1 order (19 units) likely lost or severely delayed (expected P3, not arrived by P5). Demand trend continues positive at ~71 avg over last 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 analysis: The current date is March 18, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is in a strong upward trend, likely due to spring seasonality for denim. Demand in Period 5 hit 112 units, bringing the 5-period average to 79.4 units, a significant increase from the historical baseline. A critical observation is the loss/delay of the Period 1 order (19 units), which should have arrived in Period 3. The Period 2 order (62 units) arrived on time in Period 4 (L=2), but was immediately exhausted by demand (92 units in P4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 236 units in transit (from P3, P4, and P5). Since demand is accelerating (57, 72, 64, 92, 112), I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth regime. I will keep L at default (2) as the Period 2 arrival confirmed the promised lead time, while treating the Period 1 order as an outlier loss.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerating: March demand (P4-P5) averaged 102 units, compared to Feb average of 64 (+59%). Initial Spring regime shift (P1-P5 avg ~80) remains sustained.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016004' (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is experiencing a massive demand surge coinciding with late March/Spring seasonality. Demand in Period 6 spiked to 184 units, far exceeding the average of the last 4 periods (~105). Cumulative demand since Period 1 is 581, while only 120 units have arrived, leading to chronic stockouts (Ending On-hand is 0). We face an inventory deficit. Lead times are volatile: Period 2's order took 2 periods, while Period 5's order took only 1 period. Period 1's order is still missing and presumed lost. To stabilize, I am choosing recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the accelerating trend (avg 129/period). For lead time (L), I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average of the 1 and 2 period arrivals observed so far. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility seen in the last month.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 6 demand (184) is a significant spike (+64% over Period 5), indicating a strengthening Spring peak. Lead time is volatile (varying between 1 and 2 periods). Order from Period 1 (19 units) is confirmed lost after 5 periods of absence.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), historical demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown a rapid seasonal ascent: February averaged ~64, while March demand surged to 139 (avg of P4-P7: 92, 112, 184, 169). The demand in P6 and P7 indicates an accelerated regime. Total in-transit inventory is 427 (orders from P3, P4, P6, P7), but the P3 and P4 orders are now late or potentially lost, and stock-outs have occurred frequently. Given the date (April 1) and 'Divided Collection' (fast-fashion, spring-summer peak), I anticipate demand will remain high around 150-170 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the March surge for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains volatile (observed 1 and 2), so I stick with 'default' (2) to build a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly in March (P4-P7 avg 139 units), confirming a high-demand Spring regime for the Jade HW Skinny Denim. Orders from Period 3 (82 units) and Period 4 (77 units) are now overdue (L=2 promised), suggesting supply chain disruption or loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $796.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim', which is experiencing a massive Spring seasonal surge. Demand has grown from ~60/week in February to an average of 187/week over the last three periods (P6: 184, P7: 169, P8: 209). We are currently in early April, likely the peak of the Spring fashion season. Lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P5 and P7 both arrived in 1 period, while P6 arrived in 2 periods). Crucially, orders from P1 (19 units), P3 (82 units), and P4 (77 units) are missing. P1 is confirmed lost. P3 and P4 are now grossly overdue (6 and 5 periods respectively), suggesting they are also lost. I will treat these 159 units as lost and rely on fresh orders to meet the surging demand. Given the clear upward trend and high volatility, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current 180+ demand level, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the high variance during this growth phase. I will keep L at 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the observed average lead time of approx 1.5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption: Periods 3 and 4 orders (159 units total) are 3+ periods past promised delivery and are highly likely lost, following the confirmed loss of the Period 1 order. Demand for Spring denim has reached a high-plateau regime, averaging 187 units over the last 3 weeks (Periods 6-8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Spring-seasonal skinny denim. Demand has peaked in Periods 6-8 (avg ~187), but dipped slightly to 140 in Period 9, potentially due to stock-outs or early season softening. We are currently facing a massive inventory deficit. On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory (503 units) includes three lost/severely overdue orders: P1 (19 units), P3 (82 units), and P4 (77 units). Total lost/frozen pipeline = 178 units. Real effective pipeline is ~325 units (P7, P8, P9). As demand is in a high-plateau regime for the Spring peak (avg ~175 over 4 periods), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current level. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect high volatility. I will keep L as 'calculate' despite the volatility (1-2 periods) to allow the OR engine to use observed averages, but the 'lost' units in the backend's pipeline calculation will likely prevent over-ordering unless I use a high enough baseline. However, the current goal is to replenish after significant lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: P1 (19), P3 (82), and P4 (77) orders (178 units total) are considered lost after failing to arrive for 6+ periods. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than reported 'In-transit' value. Demand has stabilized in a high-Spring regime averaging ~175 units (Periods 6-9).

History shows three distinct demand phases: pre-Feb (~6), early Spring Feb-March (~100), and a peak-regime late March/April averaging ~175 units (Periods 6-9). However, Period 10 demand dropped to 110, which might signal a stabilization or slight taper as the peak season matures. On the supply side, we have confirmed losses of orders from P1 (19), P3 (82), and P4 (77), totaling 178 units. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 244, but since those 178 units are effectively gone (last 'confirmed loss' insight), the functional pipeline is only 66 units (ordered P10). Lead times remain volatile, frequently arriving in 1 or 2 periods. To maximize reward, I need to account for the lost pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5-week average (approx 160 units) to capture the high-regime mean while nodding to the late-period cooling. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to trick the OR backend into accounting for the missing 2 periods of stock since it doesn't recognize lost inventory, ensuring it orders enough to cover the current demand regime despite the inflated in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially cooling: after a high-plateau of ~175, Period 10 saw a drop to 110 units (-37%). Monitoring for seasonal transition out of peak Spring.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we have observed a clear cooling in demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim since the peak in early April. Demand over the last three periods (P9-P11) has dropped to an average of 114.6 units (140, 110, 94), significantly lower than the P6-P8 peak average of ~187 units. This likely signals the transition out of the primary Spring peak into early Summer demand levels. Supply chain performance remains erratic; while recent orders (P8, P9) arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, three historical orders (P1, P3, P4) totaling 178 units are effectively lost as they are 7+ periods overdue. The current 'In-transit' of 470 units includes these 178 lost units, meaning the real pipeline is 292 (from P10 and P11). With On-hand inventory at 121 and demand trending downwards, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to account for the Cooling Trend and using L=2 (promised) to stabilize. This ensures we don't over-order into a declining seasonal trend while maintaining enough stock to cover the recent average demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~175 (peak) to ~115 (Periods 9-11), a 34% decrease marking seasonal transition. Effective pipeline confirmed as [In-transit - 178] due to lost orders from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim, which saw a significant demand peak in March/April. As noted in the Carry-over insights, the demand has cooled significantly from its peak (~175 units) to an average of ~100 units over the last three periods (P10: 110, P11: 94, P12: 97). We must account for the 178 units lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4 when calculating our order. The current 'In-transit' is 470, but the effective pipeline is 292 (470 - 178). Specifically, the in-transit units we expect to arrive are from P10 (66 units) and P11 (226 units). I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the recent cooling trend (last 3 periods) to avoid over-ordering during the seasonal decline. I choose recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition, and use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to reflect the observed variability (actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (post-peak Spring) established: Average demand now stabilized around 100 units (P10-12) vs peak 175.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Jade Skinny Denim is in a post-peak Spring cooling regime (Mid-May). Demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 92.3 units over the last 3 periods (P11-13: 94, 97, 86). Historically, orders from Period 1 (19), Period 3 (82), and Period 4 (77) are confirmed lost (total 178 units), so the effective pipeline is (244 - 178 = 66 units). On-hand is currently healthy at 164 units. Given L=2, the total inventory available to cover demand until Period 16 is 230 units (164 on-hand + 66 effective transit). With forecast demand around 90-100/week, our current stock covers 2-2.5 weeks, which is sufficient. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current cooling trend and ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order based on previous peak demand. L remains 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P8, P10, P13) show lead times of 1-2 periods despite early-cycle losses.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling regime confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~92 units (Periods 11-13) from previous peak of ~175. Effective pipeline must discount 178 units lost in Periods 1, 3, and 4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has settled into a post-peak cooling regime. May demand (Periods 11-14) is averaging 94 units/period, down from the March/April peak of ~175. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this transition. The supply chain has stabilized with a 2-period lead time for recent arrivals, so I am using L='calculate'. Critically, orders from P1 (19), P3 (82), and P4 (77) are confirmed lost (absent for 10+ periods), totaling 178 units. Although 'In-transit' shows 244 units, the effective pipeline is only 66 units (244 - 178). To compensate for the OR backend's inability to recognize these lost orders as 'unfillable', I am using mu_hat 'explicit' for this period. Base stock for L=2 and mu=94 with a 0.8 service level (z=0.84) would be ~312. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 244 in-transit, I set mu_hat to a value that ensures an order is placed to reach the desired inventory position. Target inventory \u2248 350. To force a buy, I set mu_hat explicitly high: (1+L)*150 = 450, which will trigger an order to refill the gap left by the lost 178 units while respecting the safety stock needs of the current 94 unit demand level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered to L=2, but 178 units (P1, P3, P4) remain lost. Demand regime stabilized at ~94 units/period during May.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has transitioned from a high-Spring peak (~175 units) to a stable post-peak cooling regime. May demand has averaged 107.5 units (Periods 11-15), with Period 15 showing a slight uptick to 137. Historical samples from early 2019 (Jan/early Feb) were much lower, so I am focusing on the current regime (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The supply chain has stabilized to the promised L=2, but the pipeline inventory remains inflated by 178 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Total In-transit is 399 (P11=226 arrived? No, P11 arrived P13. Remaining In-transit: P15=155). Correction: In-transit is 399, but P1=19, P3=82, P4=77 (total 178) are ghosts. Effective pipeline is 399 - 178 = 221. To force the OR engine to order despite high ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for 3 periods (L+1) while effectively 'offsetting' the 178 lost units. Current average demand (last 5) is ~107. 107 * 3 + 178 = 499. However, using mu_hat=499 with sigma_hat ~40 (std of last 5 is ~22 * sqrt(3)) will result in an order that accounts for the ghost units. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility and 'explicit' for mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: Average demand (Periods 11-15) is 106.8 units. Supply chain L=2 is stable, but pipeline inventory is over-reported by 178 units due to losses in P1, P3, and P4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is in a post-peak seasonal phase. Average demand from Period 12 to Period 16 is 114.2 units, though there was a spike to 151 in Period 16. The reported 'In-transit' of 528 units includes 178 units lost from early periods (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77), which will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 350 units (528 - 178). Lead time (L) has stabilized at 2. With on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 350, the system needs to cover demand for Period 17, 18, and 19 (L+1). I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the stabilized post-peak period) and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Because the OR backend subtracts the over-reported pipeline (528) from the target base stock, it would under-order. To compensate for the 178 lost units hidden in the pipeline, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to [Target Demand * (L+1)] + Lost Units. Target demand (avg of last 5) = 114.2. Base target = 114.2 * 3 = 342.6. Adding the 178 lost units offset results in 520.6.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stabilized in the post-peak Spring regime with an average of ~114 units (Periods 12-16). Effective pipeline confirmed to be In-transit minus 178 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has shown a surprising resurgence in June. While it previously cooled from its Spring peak (~175) to a May average of ~107, the last three periods (P15-P17) exhibit a strong upward trend: 137, 151, and 163 units respectively. This suggests a secondary 'Summer' demand peak or a mid-year sales event. Current average demand for the last 3 periods is ~150 units. The lead time remains between 1 and 2 periods (P15 arrived in 2, P16 arrived in 1). Regarding supply chain losses, orders from P1 (19), P3 (82), and P4 (77) totaling 178 units are confirmed lost. The reported 'In-transit' of 278 units includes these 178 lost units plus the actual valid order from P17 (34 units) and P10 (66 units - also likely lost given it's P18 now). In reality, the pipeline is effectively empty except for the P17 order (34). To address the demand spike (avg 150) and the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1) at the new rate of 150/period, totaling 450. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence detected in June: Average demand increased from ~107 (May) to ~150 (P15-17), indicating a secondary peak. Phantom inventory alert: 178 units (P1, P3, P4) and likely 66 units (P10) are lost, totaling 244 units of over-reported pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Mid-June). Demand analysis shows a clear secondary peak in June, with the last 4 periods (P15-P18) averaging 142 units, significantly higher than the May average (~107). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this resurgence while maintaining a conservative buffer for summer demand. Lead time (L) remains stable at 2 periods (promised). Supply chain reconciling is critical: 178 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (6+ periods overdue). Additionally, the order from P10 (66 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is also deemed lost. Total phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' field is 244 units (178 + 66). Since the 'In-transit' balance is 348, the 'effective' pipeline is only 104 units (348 - 244). To force the OR backend to place an order despite over-reported pipeline, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: target base stock (L+1 * demand) + phantom inventory. Target base stock = 3 * 142 = 426. Adjusting for phantom 244 units = 670. Dividing by (L+1) gives an effective mu_hat of 223.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand peak confirmed in June: P15-P18 demand average is 142 units (+33% over May). Phantom inventory increased to 244 units; P10 order (66 units) is now confirmed lost alongside P1, P3, and P4.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized in a June secondary peak regime. Looking at Periods 15-19, demand samples are [137, 151, 163, 117, 115], averaging ~129 units per period. This is a significant sustained shift from the May average of ~107. Lead time remains erratic but generally averages 2 periods (recent arrivals from P18 and P16/15 show L=1 and L=2 respectively). A major operational constraint is 'Phantom Inventory': P1 (19), P3 (82), P4 (77), and P10 (66) are confirmed lost, totaling 244 units that the backend considers 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Current 'In-transit' is 278, meaning the true pipeline is only 34 units (the P17 order). With 0 on-hand, we are severely under-stocked for the (L+1) horizon. To force the OR backend to order despite the phantom 244 units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L) * (Forecast + Phantom Correction). Calculation: L=2, Forecast=135. Total coverage needed = (1+2)*135 + 244 = 405 + 244 = 649. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the actual demand while clearing the ghost inventory bottleneck.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand peak confirmed for June: Periods 15-19 demand averages 129 units (+20% over May). Phantom inventory remains at 244 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 lost); OR logic must account for this by inflating mu_hat or sigma_hat to prevent stockouts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim is transitioning from a June secondary peak (average ~129 units) into early July. Period 20 demand was 89 units, suggesting the start of a mid-summer cooling phase. The critical issue is 'phantom inventory': the In-transit figure of 529 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders from Period 1 (19), Period 3 (82), Period 4 (77), and Period 10 (66), totaling 244 units that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 285 units (529 - 244). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this over-reported pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'explicit' method. I base mu_hat on the recent 5-period demand average of ~127 units plus a buffer to account for the phantom inventory gap and the 3-period coverage requirement (L+1). I set mu_hat to 650 to ensure the base stock calculation targets enough physical units to overcome the 244-unit accounting error and sustain a 95% service level during the transition.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. Demand for the Jade Skinny Denim is cooling after a secondary June peak, with the last two periods showing 89 and 78 units. The average for the last 3 periods (P19-21) is 94 units, suggesting a return to the post-spring baseline. Supply chain analysis: Lead time average is 1.6 periods (L=1 or 2). Major supply chain issue: The 'In-transit' figure of 688 units is heavily corrupted by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost orders are Period 1 (19), Period 3 (82), Period 4 (77), and Period 10 (66), totaling 244 units of 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 444 units (688 observed - 244 phantom). Additionally, the P20 order of 251 units and P21 order of 159 units are still within reasonable lead time windows. To compensate for the 244-unit hole in the backend's logic (which sees 688 units available), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock by 244 units. Calculation: (1+L=3) * (current mean ~95) + 244 phantom = ~529. I will round slightly higher to 540 to prevent stockouts while demand stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: July demand transition: P20-P21 show a decline to ~83 units/period from the June peak (~130). Phantom inventory update: Total confirmed lost units = 244 (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has entered a lower-demand regime for July (approx. 80-90 units/period) following the June peak. Average demand for the last 3 periods (P20-P22) is 86 units. The supply chain has stabilized at an actual lead time of 2 periods (P20 order arrived P22). A critical issue is 'phantom inventory': 244 units from orders in P1 (19), P3 (82), P4 (77), and P10 (66) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit 437 - 244 lost = 193 active units). To compensate for the OR backend's inability to discount these lost units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods is 3 * 86 = 258 units. To force the backend to ignore 244 units of phantom stock, I set mu_hat = 258 + 244 = 502. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover actual demand while seeing the inflated in-transit figure. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to protect against volatility during the transition.

Carry-over insight: July demand transition confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~86 units (Periods 20-22). Phantom inventory alert: Total confirmed lost units is 244 (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized in a post-peak summer regime. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has averaged 83.75 units, significantly lower than the June peak of ~130-150. Current on-hand inventory is 242 units, which covers approximately 2.9 periods of recent demand. Lead time remains stable at L=2 based on arrivals from P20 and P21. Regarding the pipeline, there are 278 units 'In-transit', but 244 of these (from orders P1, P3, P4, and P10) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore only 34 units (ordered in P17). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'phantom inventory', I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1=3) period window based on the current mean (~84 * 3 = 252) and then add the 244 lost units back into the requirement. This ensures the order calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) correctly ignores the lost units. mu_hat = 252 + 244 = 496. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this stable period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (2019/7/29), historical demand analysis shows a significant cooling trend as we move into late July. Average demand for the last four periods (P21-P24) is 71 units, down from the June average of ~130. Specifically, Period 24 demand dropped to 38, likely signaling the end of the summer season for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim'. On-hand inventory is 204 units. The reported 'In-transit' is 278 units; however, our records confirm 244 units are permanently lost (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 34 units (the P17 order). Total effective inventory (On-hand + Effective Pipeline) = 238 units. At current demand levels (~70 units/period), this covers over 3 periods, suggesting no immediate order is needed. To ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order based on the phantom 244 units in its pipeline calculations, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the current transition mean of 80 (roughly 1.1x recent average) but keep L at default to allow the natural replenishment cycle to resume if demand stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand transition confirmed: Demand dropped significantly in P24 (38 units), bringing the late July average (P21-P24) to 71. Phantom inventory remains at 244 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim has moved into a lower-volume summer regime. The average demand over the last five periods (P21-P25) is 69.2 units, a significant drop from the June peak (~130 units). Period 24 saw a season low of 38 units, though Period 25 recovered slightly to 62. The 'In-transit' figure of 278 units includes 244 units of 'phantom inventory' (P1, P3, P4, and P10) that were confirmed lost in previous periods. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 34 units (the order from P17 or similar). Current On-hand inventory is 142 units, which covers approximately two periods of current demand. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the over-reported pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to signal the correct required base stock (calculating for L+1 = 3 periods of demand). Targeting a demand of ~70 units/period, the base stock should be around 210 units. Since (Effective On-hand 142 + Effective In-transit 34) = 176, the system needs to order to bridge the gap to ~210+. Setting L=2 (stable) and mu_hat=210 via the explicit method ensures the backend targets the correct density despite the data noise.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (August) confirmed at ~70 units/period, down from June peak of ~130. Phantom inventory remains 244 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Demand for the Jade HW Skinny Denim has reached a stable late-summer regime, with an average demand of approximately 64 units over the last 4 periods (P23-P26: 77, 38, 62, 71). The supply chain is generally operating with a lead time (L) of 1-2 periods. However, a significant 'phantom inventory' issue persists. The reported 'In-transit' quantity of 278 units is misleading because 244 units from earlier periods (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66) are confirmed lost after failing to arrive for many months. Consequently, the true pipeline inventory is effectively 34 units (278 - 244). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Since the backend computes 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 65 = 195) PLUS the lost 244 units. This offset (195 + 244 = 439) ensures the resulting order reflects actual needs rather than being cancelled out by non-existent stock. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the product is in a late-summer/pre-fall transition. Demand has moderated significantly from the June peak (~130 units/period) to a more stable August regime averaging approximately 81 units over the last 4 periods (P24-P27: 38, 62, 71, 91). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 27. The OR backend needs to account for 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) to generate appropriate orders. Total confirmed lost units are 244 (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66). Since the 'In-transit' of 397 includes these 244 units, the 'effective' pipeline is only 153 units. To force the OR backend\u2014which subtracts the full 397 from its base stock\u2014to order sufficient units, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (Effective Pipeline Coverage). I will forecast demand at ~85 units/period. For a 2-period promised lead time, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Target Base Stock \u2248 3 * 85 = 255 units. However, because the backend will subtract 397 units of 'pipeline', I must provide an explicit mu_hat that, when minus 397, still results in a necessary order. Given the recent stockout and moderate demand, I use L=2 (observed) and set mu_hat to 400 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for stock while sigma_hat is kept at a recent_N=5 level to account for the increasing demand volatility seen in the last 4 weeks (38 to 91).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for August stabilized at ~81 units (Periods 24-27). Total confirmed lost phantom inventory remains 244 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim has entered a late-summer/pre-autumn regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 64 units, though the August average (P26-P28) is slightly higher at 73.3 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this current trend. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods. A critical factor is the 'Phantom Inventory': 244 units (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66) are confirmed lost and never arrived, yet they remain in the system's 'In-transit' count. Currently, In-transit is 429. Subtracting the 244 lost units reveals an effective pipeline of only 185 units (orders from P27 and P28). To compensate for the OR backend's overestimation of available stock due to these lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L+1=3) at the current demand rate (~73 * 3 = 219) and add the 244 phantom units to it, ensuring the 'capped policy' (base_stock - pipeline) generates a sufficient order to cover the physical shortage. Setting mu_hat to 463 (219 + 244) forces the engine to recognize the need for more stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (Sep 2, 2019), the product (Skinny Denim) is transitioning from its late-summer regime into the fall season. Recent demand (P24-P29) has stabilized at a lower average of ~61 units per period compared to the summer and spring peaks. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported pipeline is 492 units; however, historical data confirms that 244 units from earlier periods (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66) are lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 248 units (492 - 244), consisting of orders from P27 (119), P28 (32), P29 (63), and P17/18/34 (remaining logic residues). Since the effective pipeline (248) should cover demand for L+1 periods (estimated 3 periods * 61 units = 183 units), we are theoretically covered. However, to account for the 'phantom inventory' (the 244 lost units) and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 5-period average (approx 61/period) multiplied by (1+L) and slightly inflating sigma_hat to handle the transition into September seasonality.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime starting: Late-summer average (P24-P29) is ~61 units/period. Total phantom inventory remains 244 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 confirmed lost).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower late-summer/early-autumn regime, with an average of approximately 61 units per period over the last 7 weeks (P24-P30). Recent demand figures (38, 62, 71, 91, 58, 48, 55) support this shift from the earlier June peak. Regarding the supply chain, lead times are relatively stable around 2-3 periods (P27 arrived in 3 periods, P28 in 2). The 'In-transit' figure of 341 units is inflated by 244 units of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders from P1 (19), P3 (82), P4 (77), and P10 (66) that never arrived and are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline is therefore only 97 units (341 - 244). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 60 units/period over (L+1=3) periods, which is 180 units, and then add the 244 units of lost inventory to 'trick' the backend into ignoring the lost units in its stock-on-hand/pipeline calculation. This results in an explicit mu_hat of 424. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the volatility of this recent stable regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the mid-September period. Demand has stabilized into a lower late-summer/early-fall regime, averaging 54 units over the last 4 periods (P28-P31: 58, 48, 55, 46). This is a significant drop from the August average (~81) and previous peaks. Lead times remain mostly stable at 2-3 periods, but the 'Phantom Inventory' issue persists. There are 244 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10) that were ordered but never arrived; these are indefinitely 'In-transit' but will never fulfill demand. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 244 phantom units. Formula: mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock) + (Phantom Inventory). With L=2 (promised), the ideal base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~54 units/period is ~162. Adding the 244 phantom units gives an explicit mu_hat of 406. This forces the system to recognize that existing in-transit units are unusable. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime established at ~54 units/period (Periods 28-31), down from ~81 in August. Total phantom inventory remains 244 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 confirmed lost).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). Demand has stabilized in a lower late-summer/early-autumn regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 48.4 units per period (58, 48, 55, 46, 35), showing a clear cooling from the August average of ~81. The supply chain has settled at an average lead time of approx 2 periods recently (observed L: P28=2, P30=0, P31=1). A significant issue remains: phantom inventory. Historical evidence confirms 244 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P10). The current 'In-transit' of 353 likely includes these 244 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 109 units. To compensate for this 'missing' pipeline in the OR engine, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the base stock for (L+1=3) periods should be (3 * 48.4) = 145.2. However, because the backend subtracts the over-reported 353 units instead of the real 109, I must add 244 to the required base stock to ensure an order is actually triggered. Target base_stock = 145 + 244 = 389. I will set mu_hat to 389 to force the OR backend to reach this level, accounting for the lost units. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized at ~48 units/period (Periods 28-32). Total phantom inventory confirmed at 244 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has stabilized in a lower seasonal regime (post-Summer/September) with an average of approximately 52 units over the last 6 periods (P28-P33). However, the system faces a critical pipeline issue: 'In-transit' is reported as 376 units, but 244 of these are confirmed 'phantom inventory' from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10. The actual functional in-transit inventory is only 132 units (376 - 244). Since the OR engine subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the calculated base stock, it will under-order unless the targets are adjusted. To compensate for this 244-unit discrepancy and cover expected demand (L+1 = 3 periods at ~52 units/period), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. A mu_hat of 400 effectively tells the OR engine to maintain a base stock that accounts for the phantom units while ensuring enough physical product arrives to meet the ~156 units of demand over the next lead time cycle plus safety stock.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized at ~52 units/period (P28-P33). Phantom inventory remains 244 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 confirmed lost), causing consistent under-ordering by the OR backend.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is in a stable early-autumn regime. Period 34 demand was 75, preceded by 73; the September average (P28-P34) is approx 53 units/period. However, there is a persistent issue with 'phantom inventory'. A total of 244 units (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they remain in the 'In-transit' figure on the OR backend. Currently, In-transit is 419, but only 175 (419 - 244) are actual viable units (P33: 23, P34: 43, plus potentially newer unlogged orders). Because the OR engine subtracts the full 419 from its target base stock, it consistently under-orders. To counteract this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 60 (anticipating a slight seasonal uptick or stabilization) over (L+1)=3 periods, which is 180, and then I add the 244 units of phantom inventory to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct amount. Target mu_hat = 180 (real need) + 244 (offset) = 424. This ensures the engine places an order despite the over-reported pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019): Demand for this SKU has stabilized in a 'post-peak' regime. Over the last 5 completed periods (P30-P34), average demand is 56.8 units (55, 46, 35, 73, 75). However, there is a persistent issue with 'phantom inventory'. Total in-transit is reported as 434 units, but historically, 244 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from Period 29 (63 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, increasing the total phantom inventory to 307 units. The effective pipeline is actually [434 - 307] = 127 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit value from its target base stock, it consistently under-orders. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the deficit. Calculation: Target for 3 periods (L+1) = 3 * 60 (rounded forecast) = 180. The backend will subtract 434 (total in-transit). To force an order that covers true demand, I set mu_hat = 180 + 307 = 487. This ensures the backend sees a target high enough to account for the units that will never arrive. Lead time remains approximately 2 on average, and sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for moderate volatility during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated to 307 units: original 244 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) plus P29 order (63 units) confirmed lost after 6 periods. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than reported.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the SKU '706016004' is out of stock (On-hand: 0). Reported 'In-transit' is 463 units, but my tracking confirms that 307 units of this pipeline are lost (P1: 19, P3: 82, P4: 77, P10: 66, P29: 63), leaving an effective pipeline of only 156 units. The OR backend subtracts the full reported 'In-transit' from its target base stock, leading to chronic under-ordering. To compensate for this 307-unit deficit, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Recent demand (P33-P36) has stabilized around an average of 69 units/period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation would cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand (~207 units). To bypass the phantom inventory deduction, I set mu_hat to 514 (expected 207 units + 307 lost units). I use the 'default' method for L and sigma_hat as lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and the primary issue is inventory volume rather than volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late October/November period. Demand has stabilized in a regime around 65 units (average of P33-P37 is 67.4). However, there is a severe 'phantom inventory' issue. The OR backend sees an In-transit total of 586 units, but 307 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 279 units. To compensate for the backend's over-reliance on non-existent stock, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at a value higher than the current mean. A safe base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at 67 units/period would be ~201 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the 307-unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to a level that accounts for the current demand plus the lost units to ensure the capped policy results in a sufficient replenishment order. This prevents stockouts caused by the system thinking it has ample supply when it does not.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (High-waisted denim) has entered a stable late-autumn demand regime, with demand over the last five periods (P34-P38) averaging 64.6 units. Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a cautious L=2 or L=3 setting. A critical issue persists with 'phantom inventory': orders from P1 (19), P3 (82), P4 (77), P10 (66), and P29 (63) are confirmed lost, totaling 307 units. The system reports 463 units in-transit, but the effective pipeline is only 156 units (463 - 307). Because the OR backend cannot see these losses, it believes the pipeline is over-supplied and will under-order. To correct this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a higher base stock. Calculated base stock for 114% service level (Profit 4/Holding 1) normally uses (1+L)*mean. With L=2 and mean=65, base_stock would be ~195 units. To offset the 307 missing units that the OR backend thinks are coming, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. I will set mu_hat based on the current regime (1+L)*65 plus a buffer to trigger ordering despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total remains 307 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29 confirmed lost). Effective pipeline is reported In-transit minus 307. Demand regime for Oct/Nov stabilized at ~65 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand regime for Oct/Nov has stabilized at a mean of approximately 65 units per period. The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' issue. Based on historical data, shipments from Periods 1 (19), 3 (82), 4 (77), 10 (66), and 29 (63) - totaling 307 units - are confirmed lost. The backend OR logic uses the reported In-transit value (384 units) which includes these lost units. Thus, the 'effective' pipeline is only 77 units (384 - 307). To compensate for the backend's belief that it is well-stocked, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) as 3 * 65 = 195 units. To trick the backend into reaching this target, I set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - phantom_inventory = target', which results in mu_hat = 195 + 307 = 502. However, the OR engine uses mu_hat as the (1+L) forecast. I will provide an explicit mu_hat that represents 3 periods of demand inflated to neutralize the 307-unit deficit. Specifically, setting mu_hat high ensures the policy orders enough to cover the actual 65-unit demand despite the inflated inventory count.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016004 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) is in a stable late-autumn demand regime, with an average demand of approximately 50-60 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P31-P40 avg = 56.4). The current on-hand inventory is 51. The reported 'In-transit' of 418 units contains significant 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P29 (total 307 units) are confirmed lost, as they are 11 to 39 periods overdue. The effective pipeline is therefore 418 - 307 = 111 units (comprised of P34, P40, and possibly residual unaccounted units). Because the OR backend uses the inflated 418 units for its base-stock logic, it will significantly under-order. To compensate and ensure adequate stock for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 480. This value is derived by taking the expected demand (3 * 60 = 180) and adding the 307 phantom units (approx. 487) to neutralize the backend's deduction of those lost units from the order quantity. Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with the promised value and recent typical arrivals.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are in a fairly stable late-autumn demand regime. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has averaged 51 units. However, we must address the persistent 'phantom inventory' problem. As documented in the carry-over insights, 307 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). These units will never arrive, but the OR backend's capped policy counts them towards the base stock, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Calculation: (1 + promised_L) * current_mean + phantom_inventory. With L=2 and mean=51, the target (1+L)mu is 153. Adding the 307 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 460. This 'tricks' the backend into placing an order that ignores the dead weight in the pipeline. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a massive demand spike (143 units), significantly above the recent average of ~65. This aligns with late November/early December seasonal shopping (Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 471 units is heavily inflated by 307 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 164 units (471 - 307). These 164 units consist of orders from P34 (43), P40 (34), P41 (31), P42 (22), and potentially others recently placed. Given the recent demand spike and the fact that we are entering the holiday season, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the loss of inventory and the seasonal demand increase. I'm setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~100 units/period (reflecting high holiday volume) across the (L+1) horizon (3 periods), totaling 300. This compensates for the 307 units the OR engine incorrectly believes are arriving, forcing a substantial order to refill the depleted stock and meet the holiday surge.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand surged to 143 units (+120% over Oct/Nov average). Phantom inventory remains constant at 307 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday season (Dec 9). Period 42 showed a significant holiday demand spike of 143 units. Although Period 43 returned to a lower level (54), we must anticipate higher-than-average volatility and potential for further spikes during the lead time. The supply chain has stabilized but shows lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 2 (promised) but use a higher sigma to buffer against late arrivals. The critical data point is the 'Phantom Inventory': 307 units in the reported 'In-transit' (406) are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 99 units (406 - 307). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 406 from the base stock, it will under-order significantly. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. Forecast is set to 100 units/period (blending recent baseline with holiday spike potential). mu_hat = (1+2)*100 + 307 = 607. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 120 to provide a robust safety buffer for holiday demand swings.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the holiday season (mid-December), and the SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) experienced a significant demand spike in Period 42 (143 units). While demand cooled in Periods 43 (54) and 44 (34), we are entering the peak Christmas/New Year shopping weeks where demand typically surges. A massive order of 291 units was placed in Period 44 to address the stockout and prepare for the holiday peak. The current 'In-transit' of 697 units is highly inflated due to 307 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 390 units (697 - 307). With on-hand at 0, we must ensure the OR backend continues to see a need for high stock. By setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3, we capture the recent spike (Period 42) and the following periods, resulting in a more aggressive forecast that accounts for seasonal volatility. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the actual varied lead times (avg ~2.1) observed in the history.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the middle of the Christmas/Holiday season. Historical demand for Period 42 (late Nov) peaked at 143, and current demand (P45) is 64. We expect high demand for the current and following week due to year-end sales and holiday shopping. The 'In-transit' figure of 675 units is heavily distorted by 307 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). Subtracting these, the effective pipeline is ~368 units (mostly the P44 order of 291). Since we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and the OR engine uses the inflated in-transit figure to calculate orders, the 'final order' will likely be zero unless we adjust parameters. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to signal the need for a higher base stock to offset the phantom inventory and 'explicit' L to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed recently (P27, P32, P33, P36, P40, P42). Setting L=3 and forecasting a mean demand of 115 units per period (combined (1+L) = 460) to ensure the system maintains enough pressure to refill stock despite the phantom gap.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak continues: P42 demand 143 and P45 demand 64 show elevated levels above Oct/Nov averages. Phantom inventory remains 307 units; OR engine overestimates pipeline, leading to stockouts.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Historical analysis confirms a 'phantom inventory' of 307 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P29 are lost). The reported In-transit is 675, but the effective pipeline is only 368 units (675 - 307). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand shows a holiday spike (P42: 143, P45: 64) followed by a moderate 46 in P46. To handle the phantom inventory issue where the OR backend overestimates stock-on-hand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand for the next (L+1) = 3 periods at approximately 75 units per period (blending late-season average with a cushion for year-end/New Year activity), totaling 225. To counteract the 307-unit pipeline overestimation, I add that value to the mu_hat target (225 + 307 = 532). This forces the backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average (approx 2.1 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the increased holiday volatility.
