This is a non-seasonal, high-frequency wardrobe staple with steady demand. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data shows a clear upward trend (59, 78, 96, 123, 144) as we move from early January into February. The last recorded demand was 144. Feb 11 is mid-February, typically a stable period for 'everyday' apparel. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed now (P1) should arrive at the start of P3 (visible in P4's decision phase). I need to cover demand for P1, P2, and P3. d) Inventory Assessment: We start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Order Logic: With a current trend approaching 150+ units/period and a 2-period lead time, I must order enough to cover three periods of demand (P1, P2, P3). Expecting demand of ~160 in P1, ~175 in P2, and ~190 in P3 (linear extension), I need approximately 525 units to avoid stockouts while arrivals are pending. I will order 550 to provide a small safety buffer for the increasing trend.",

Looking at the demand history, we saw an initial surge in January (avg ~100/wk) followed by a cooling period in February/March (P1-P5 avg: 71/wk). On P1 (2019-02-11), 550 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the timeline rules, an order placed in P1 with lead_time=2 should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message (read at P4 start). However, the P3, P4, and P5 conclude messages all show arrived=0. This strongly suggests the P1 shipment (550 units) is lost or severely delayed. Current on-hand is 0, and we have had 5 consecutive periods of lost sales due to zero inventory. I will assume a demand regime of approximately 75 units/week based on the recent average. Since the P1 order for 550 units is missing, I must place a new order to cover the (L+1) window, which is 3 periods. 75 * 3 = 225 units.

The 'In-transit' of 550 units refers to the order placed in Period 1, which has been established as lost in several previous carry-over insights (since it hasn't arrived by P15). Therefore, the effective in-transit pipeline is 0. On-hand inventory is 254 units. With current demand around 60 units/week, the inventory level represents ~4.2 weeks of stock. Given the L+1 cycle (3 weeks of demand need to be covered to avoid stockouts before the next possible shipment), we need to maintain roughly 180-240 units to ensure service levels while minimizing the high holding cost ($1/unit vs $4 profit).

In-transit is nominally 1480, but 980 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1: 550, P26: 110, P29: 100, P34: 220).

To maintain a service level for the next 3 weeks (L+1 periods, approx 240 units total demand) and cover potential variability or further losses, I need to ensure the pipeline remains robust. With 500 units in the real pipeline and 2 on hand, I am technically covered for the short term if they arrive; however, given the history of lost shipments (4 losses total), I will place a moderate order to buffer against further delivery failures and prepare for potential December demand shifts.",

This is consistent with a pre-holiday lull for basic denim before potential December gifting spikes. Inventory analysis: We have 82 units on-hand. The total 'In-Transit' is 1430 units, but this contains significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Confirmed lost: P1 (550), P26 (110), P29 (100), P34 (220) = 980 units lost. Effective In-Transit = 1430 - 980 = 450 units. The effective pipeline includes orders from P38 (150 - overdue, 4 periods), P40 (200 - due P42/P43), and P41 (100 - due P43/P44). While P38 is 2 periods overdue, recent arrivals (P39 order arrived in P41) suggest the supplier is functional but variable. Given the current on-hand (82) and the expected arrival of P40 (200) and P41 (100), we are well-covered for the current ~75 unit demand regime.

This peak follows a period of stabilization around 70 units/week. Historically, December demand for 'Everyday Colletion' staple denim often sees a short post-Black Friday lull followed by sustained holiday shopping. The pipeline currently shows 1530 units 'in-transit', but 980 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1: 550, P26: 110, P29: 100, P34: 220). Additionally, the Period 38 order (150 units) is now 4 periods past its order date and 2 periods past the promised lead time with no arrival in Period 42; it is now highly likely lost. This brings the total 'lost' inventory to 1,130 units. The effective pipeline is therefore: 1530 (Total In-Transit) - 1130 (Lost) = 400 units. These 400 units are from P40 (200), P41 (100), and P42 (100). With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 400, I must cover demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1).
