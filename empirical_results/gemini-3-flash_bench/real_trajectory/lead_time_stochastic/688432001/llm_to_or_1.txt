Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product 'Long leggings 2-pack' is a woman's everyday basic. Historical demand (5 samples: 155, 98, 122, 119, 142) shows a mean of 127.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 21.7. Since we are at the start of the observation period, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full recent history available. The promised lead time is 2 periods. With a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the backend will target a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, which is appropriate given the relatively high holding cost and the basic nature of the product. The initial order needs to establish the pipeline since on-hand and in-transit units are currently zero.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Long leggings 2-pack', a staple women's basic item. In Period 1, 164 units were ordered, but since the promised lead time is 2 periods, they are correctly in-transit and not yet arrived. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 11) has been [155, 98, 122, 119, 142], showing relative stability with a mean of 127.2 and a standard deviation of 21.3. For Period 2, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture this baseline. The lead time (L) is kept at 'default' (2) as no arrivals have occurred to suggest a drift yet. The goal is to establish a base stock that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand to mitigate the current 0 on-hand stock once the first shipment arrives.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Long leggings 2-pack' (Womens Everyday Basics). Analysis of historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a steady mean of approximately 127 units per week (Samples: 155, 98, 122, 119, 142, P1: 121, P2: 150). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (164 units) and P2 (147 units) are in-transit (Total 311). Specifically, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and the P2 order during P4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in P1 and P2; however, since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's critical ratio q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which naturally targets matching the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the full available history (5 samples + 2 periods) to capture the baseline demand accurately without over-weighting the slightly higher P2 demand.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Women's Everyday Basics leggings. Historical demand samples (last 5: 155, 98, 122, 119, 142) and recent gameplay demand (121, 150, 92) suggest an average demand of approximately 125 units per week. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 389 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Since the lead time is 2 periods, the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3's resolution and become visible in P3's conclude message. However, P3's conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a delay or that the lead time is at least 3 periods. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for this delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (combining historical samples and game history) to capture the base demand level while covering the extended lead time (L+1 = 4 periods).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-11. We are managing 688432001 (Women's Jersey Leggings), an everyday basic. Starting inventory was 0, and we experienced stockouts in Periods 1-3 because the first order (Period 1, 164 units) has not yet arrived despite a promised lead time of 2 periods. The Period 2 order (147 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2), but the Period 1 order is now at T+4 and still in-transit, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Demand is relatively stable, averaging 121 units/week over the 5 historical samples and 4 periods of game history (9 data points total). Current on-hand is low (44) and pipeline is 353 (including the potentially lost P1 order). I will use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the recent game history and stick to the promised lead time of 2 for L, while increasing sigma_hat to account for the supply uncertainty caused by the missing P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (164 units) is overdue (4 periods since order, promised 2) and may be lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's basic jersey legging, which typically sees steady demand but can be affected by early spring transitions. On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 5 sold out. The item has high holding costs relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), so we must be lean. However, supply chain reliability is a concern: the Period 1 order (164 units) is now 5 periods old and hasn't arrived (exceeding the promised 2-period lead time), while the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (2 periods). The Period 3 order (78 units) was expected in Period 5 but is now 1 period late. The Period 4 order (111 units) is expected in Period 6. Given the P1 loss and P3 delay, the actual lead time is unstable. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays. For demand, the last 5 observed periods (121, 150, 92, 103, 114) average 116 units. Using recent_N (N=5) will capture this steady baseline while we wait for late shipments to resolve.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 order (164 units) is now 5 periods past order date (3 periods past promised delivery) and is confirmed lost. Period 3 order is currently 1 period late.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU 688432001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant delivery instability. The Period 1 order (164 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order, promised 2). The Period 3 order (78 units) is overdue (4 periods since order, promised 2), while Period 2 arrived exactly on time (L=2). This suggests a 'lost or on-time' delivery pattern rather than just a shift in average lead time. Demand is relatively stable for an 'Everyday Basic', with the mean of the last 4 periods (P3-P6) being 98.75. Given the lost shipments, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic (on-hand + in-transit) is currently overestimating the safety stock because it still counts the lost 164 units and the overdue 78 units in the 'pipeline'. To force an order and replenish the stock-out while accounting for potential future losses, I will use an explicit L=3 (to be conservative) and explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 4-period regime. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L)*mean = 4 * 98.75 = 395. The standard deviation of the last 4 demand samples is ~12.5; sigma_hat = sqrt(4)*12.5 = 25.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Delivery instability confirmed; Period 1 order lost, Period 3 order remains overdue by 2 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 688432001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is facing significant supply chain disruption. The Period 1 order (164 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods since order, promised 2). The Period 3 order (78 units) is now 5 periods past order date (3 periods past promised delivery), and given the track record, is highly likely lost or severely delayed. Only the Period 2 order has successfully arrived (Lead Time = 2). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains steady with a mean of ~115 units per period. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, and my current pipeline (464 units) includes these likely lost shipments (164 + 78 = 242 units), the backend will under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for (L+1) periods (3 periods) at ~345 units, but I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the ~242 units in 'zombie' in-transit stock that won't arrive. Setting mu_hat to 600 units to force the backend to place a corrective order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 order (78 units) is 5 periods past order date (3 past promised) and is now considered lost alongside Period 1 order. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 242.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Current on-hand is 0. Demand for the last 5 weeks has been [114, 86, 99, 159, ?] with an average of roughly 110. The 'In-transit' total is 489. Based on the Carry-over Insights, the Period 1 order (164) and Period 3 order (78) are confirmed lost (Total 242 units). The OR backend includes these lost units in its pipeline inventory calculation, meaning it will under-order unless we compensate. To adjust for this, I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand PLUS the 242 lost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering enough. Average weekly demand is ~120 (including pre-period samples). Target base stock = (3 * 120) + 242 = 602. I set mu_hat explicitly to 602. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in recent demand (159 units in Period 8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the system shows 0 units on-hand and 602 units in-transit. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, the orders from Period 1 (164 units) and Period 3 (78 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 242 phantom units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as pipeline inventory. Additionally, the 'arrived=111' in Period 8 (ordered Period 6) confirms a lead time of 2 periods for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand is 0, and the valid pipeline consists of orders from Period 4 (111 units - overdue, likely lost), Period 8 (136 units), and Period 9 (113 units). Total reliable in-transit is likely only 249 units. Seasonal demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey leggings remains relatively stable, with an average demand across the last 9 periods of ~112 units. I will use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to handle the discrepancy between system-reported 'in-transit' and actual expected arrivals, ensuring the OR engine triggers an order despite the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 4 order (111 units) is now 6 periods past order date (4 past promised) and is confirmed lost. Total confirmed lost/phantom units in system in-transit: 353 (P1, P3, P4).

As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), we are managing a 2-pack of long leggings, a basic staple item. Historical demand mean is approximately 113 units per week, but actual sales have been frequently constrained by stockouts due to lost shipments. The 'In-transit' balance of 440 includes 353 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine the order size; if we don't account for these phantom units, the OR engine will under-order significantly. Current visible in-transit is 440, but adjusted 'real' in-transit is 440 - 353 = 87 (the Period 10 order). To force the backend to ignore the 353 lost units and place a sufficient order, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating required base stock for (L+1)=3 periods: 3 * 113 = 339 units. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat to (339 + 353) = 692. This ensures that even after subtracting the phantom 353 units, the system targets a base stock that covers our actual needs. Lead time remains 'default' (2) as recent deliveries (P8, P9) arrived within the promised window.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Systemic under-ordering risk due to 353 units of phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4) still counted in 'In-transit'.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we have on-hand inventory of 97 units and an 'In-transit' figure of 519 units. Analysis of the history confirms a severe delivery reliability issue where orders from Period 1 (164 units), Period 3 (78 units), and Period 4 (111 units) are substantially overdue (8-11 periods) and are classified as lost. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' (pipeline inventory) to subtract from the target base stock; therefore, these 353 lost/phantom units are causing the system to under-order significantly. To force the OR backend to order appropriately, I will use an 'explicit' L to shorten the look-ahead horizon while significantly inflating the 'mu_hat' via the 'explicit' method. Current demand is stable around 80 units/period. The calculation for mu_hat is (1 + L) * Forecast. Using L=2, (1+2)*80 = 240. To neutralize the 353 units of phantom stock, I set mu_hat to 240 + 353 = 593. This ensures that the base stock level (before z*sigma) is high enough to generate an order despite the 353-unit phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Phantom inventory adjustment remains critical. Explicit mu_hat of 593 used to offset 353 confirmed lost units (P1: 164, P3: 78, P4: 111) to prevent stockouts.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 519 units is severely misleading because it includes 353 units from orders in Period 1 (164), Period 3 (78), and Period 4 (111) which are long overdue and confirmed lost. The actual viable pipeline consists of Period 10 (87 units) and Period 11 (79 units), totaling 166 units. Demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has averaged 82.2 units per period. The OR engine uses the logic: order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Since 'pipeline_inventory' in the backend includes the 353 lost units, the engine will under-order unless we inflate mu_hat. To ensure the engine targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units, we set mu_hat = ((L+1) * mean_demand) + lost_units. With L=2 and mean_demand ~100 (conservative estimate for 'Everyday Basics' Jersey leggings), target mu_hat = (3 * 100) + 353 = 653. This adjustment forces the OR backend to 'see through' the phantom inventory and place an order to replenish the current zero on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Confirmed phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' field remains 353 units (P1, P3, P4). These units must be permanently offset in mu_hat calculations until they are removed from the system view, as they never arrive.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a women's basic legging 2-pack. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged 104 units over the last 13 periods. However, the system is fundamentally compromised by 'phantom inventory' totaling 353 units (lost orders from P1, P3, and P4) that still appear in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 574). These 353 units will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock calculation, leading to severe under-ordering and stockouts. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 353 lost units. Without this adjustment, base_stock (typically around 312 for L=2) minus pipeline (574) would result in zero ordering. I calculate the target mu_hat as: ((L+1) * mean_demand) + lost_units = (3 * 104) + 353 = 665. This ensures the backend places an order despite the phantom supply.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) has zero on-hand inventory and the Period 14 demand (89 units) was completely lost due to a stockout. There is a critical issue with 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' field: 353 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (164 + 78 + 111) are confirmed lost but still deducted from the base stock by the OR backend. Current in-transit is 665, but actionable in-transit is only 312 (665 - 353). To force an order that compensates for these lost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. The average demand across (L+1=3) periods is approximately 324 units (based on recent average demand of ~108). To offset the 353 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 677 (324 + 353). This ensures the OR logic [base_stock - in_transit] yields a replenishable order size. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 2 periods as recent arrivals (P8, P9, P11) arrived on or before schedule.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/27 (Period 16). The recurring issue is that 353 units of 'In-transit' inventory (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost and represent 'phantom inventory'. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock to calculate the order, these 353 units must be added back to the mu_hat to ensure the backend actually places orders and doesn't assume we are overstocked. Looking at demand, the last 8 weeks (Period 8-15) show a mean of ~92 units/period. For a lead time of 2 (target L+1 = 3 periods of cover), the base mu_hat should be approximately 276. Adding the 353 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 629. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P6, P8, P9, P11) have arrived with 1 or 2 period lead times, despite the early losses. Sigma is set to recent_N=8 to capture the current demand volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 17 for SKU 688432001 (Women's leggings). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' field displays 677 units. However, based on the historical context and carry-over insights, 353 units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 (164), 3 (78), and 4 (111). These units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation but will never arrive. Additionally, the orders from Period 14 (91 units) and Period 15 (12 units) are now at L+3 and L+2 respectively, with no 'conclude' message. Given the history of lost shipments, there is a high probability these are also lost. The only reliable 'live' shipment is the one from Period 13 (134 units), which is now 4 periods old (promised 2). If we treat only Period 13 as potentially viable, the real pipeline is ~134 units. Demand mean (~105) and lead time (avg 2) remains stable otherwise. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 353 units of phantom inventory (plus potentially more), I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that offsets these lost units. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean + safety stock. With L=2, (3*105) + (Z*sigma) \u2248 450. To bypass the phantom 353 units, I set mu_hat to approximately the target base stock plus the phantom amount: 450 + 353 = 803.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 791 units 'In-transit'. However, our carry-over insights confirm that 353 of these units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are lost and will never arrive, though they still count against our base-stock limit in the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. Additionally, the order from Period 13 (134 units) is now 5 periods old and the order from Period 14 (91 units) is 4 periods old; both are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and are now considered lost/phantom inventory. This brings the total phantom inventory to 578 units (353 + 134 + 91). To ensure the OR backend actually places an order, mu_hat must be set high enough to exceed this phantom pipeline. Average demand remains approximately 100 units/period. For a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage), we need a base stock around 300. Adding the 578 phantom units, we set mu_hat explicitly to 878. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (sqrt(3) * ~46 std dev) to maintain a buffer. We maintain L=default (2) as recent successful deliveries (P15) arrived in 2 periods, suggesting the lead time itself hasn't shifted, just the reliability of specific shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Total confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 578 units. New lost shipments: Period 13 (134 units) and Period 14 (91 units) are now 3+ periods past promised delivery. This phantom inventory must be offset in mu_hat to prevent systemic stockouts.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the In-transit field (878 units total). Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost or effectively lost (excessively overdue): P1 (164), P3 (78), P4 (111), P13 (134), and P14 (91). This totals 578 units which will not arrive. Subtracting these from the 878 units in-transit leaves an 'actual' pipeline of 300 units (representing orders from P17, P18, and our current order). Current demand is in a lower-volume regime post-spring, averaging ~60 units/week (last 3 periods: 65, 54, 57). Under the base stock formula used by the backend, the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units (including the 578 lost ones) from the target. To force the engine to order correctly and ignore the dead units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Target inventory for (L+1) periods = 3 periods * 60 units/period = 180 units. To offset the 578 phantom units that the backend will subtract, I set mu_hat = 180 (demand target) + 578 (lost units) = 758. Sigma is set based on recent demand volatility (std dev of ~6 * sqrt(3) \u2248 10). This prevents a systemic stockout caused by the broken inventory accounting.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). The product is a women's 2-pack of long leggings, a staple item. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 62.8 units (P15-P19), reflecting a slight seasonal dip compared to earlier periods. The primary operational challenge is 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' field. History shows several orders (P1: 164, P3: 78, P4: 111, P13: 134, P14: 91) have not arrived and are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time. Total phantom units = 578. The backend OR logic uses the formula 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)'. Because the in_transit field incorrectly includes these 578 lost units, the system will under-order unless we artificially inflate the base_stock. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat (which sets the base_stock level directly when sigma is accounted for). To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at ~100 units/period (using a safer average to avoid stockouts) plus the 578 phantom units, I require a base stock of approximately 878. Given the cap constraint, setting mu_hat explicitly to 878 will force the OR engine to place an order that bypasses the dead inventory signal.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a history of significant shipment losses. The 'In-transit' field shows 876 units, but a reconciliation reveals that 665 units are likely 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments): Period 1 (164), Period 3 (78), Period 4 (111), Period 13 (134), Period 14 (91), and now Period 17 (87 - ordered P10, scheduled for P12, now over 8 periods overdue). The actual reliable pipeline is only 211 units (P18: 126 units, P20: 85 units). Mean demand has stabilized at ~71 units/period over the last 3 samples. To force the OR engine to order enough to cover demand, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the expected (1+L)*demand plus an offset to counteract the 665 phantom units being deducted from the base stock. Target Base Stock = (1+2)*71 + Z*sigma. With phantom inventory at 665, the mu_hat is set to 880 to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - 876) results in a positive order approximately equal to the demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 665 units. New lost shipment: Period 10 (87 units) is now 8+ periods past promised delivery. This total phantom volume must be offset in mu_hat calculations to bypass the backend's deduction of non-existent units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, mid-summer. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey leggings' has stabilized, with an average of approximately 82 units over the last 10 periods (N=10). The primary challenge continues to be systemic 'In-transit' data corruption due to lost shipments. As of Period 22, the 'In-transit' field shows 880 units. Based on historical tracking, a significant portion of this is 'phantom inventory' that will never arrive: P1 (164), P3 (78), P4 (111), P10 (87), P13 (134), and P14 (91). Total confirmed lost = 665 units. Furthermore, the Period 17 order (126 units) is now 5 periods past the order date (3 past promised) and must now be considered lost, bringing the total phantom inventory to 791 units (665 + 126). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 880 'In-transit' units from the target base stock, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this. To protect against stockouts for 3 periods (L=2, plus current period), we need approximately 246 units (82 * 3). However, because 880 units are deducted, we set mu_hat = 246 + 880 = 1126. This ensures the backend orders enough to meet real demand despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Total confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 791 units. New lost shipment: Period 17 (126 units) is now 3 periods past promised delivery without concluding. Total lost = P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 2-pack of long leggings with stable demand. Current Period 23 (July 15). Demand has been steady, averaging ~78 units over the last 5 periods. The critical issue is systemic shipment loss affecting the 'In-transit' figure, which the OR backend uses to reduce new orders. Confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) has increased to 791 units: Period 1 (164), Period 3 (78), Period 4 (111), Period 10 (87), Period 13 (134), Period 14 (91), and now Period 17 (126) which is 5 periods old (3 past promised). Lead time fluctuates between 1-2 periods. To ensure an order is actually placed, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Desired base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) is approx 3 * 80 = 240 units. Adding 791 phantom units equals 1031. This bypasses the logic where the backend subtracts the 1041 in-transit units (which mostly don't exist). Setting mu_hat to 1031 with L=2 and sigma=50 to maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Total confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 791 units. Newest lost shipment: Period 17 (126 units) is 5 periods past order date and confirmed lost. Phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17) remain in system view and must be offset in mu_hat.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 24 (2019/07/22). The primary challenge is the significant accumulation of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that have been lost in transit but still count toward the OR backend's 'In-transit' figure, which suppresses new orders. As documented in carry-over insights, the confirmed lost units are: P1 (164), P3 (78), P4 (111), P10 (87), P13 (134), P14 (91), and P17 (126), totaling 791 units. This matches the current 'In-transit' value of 791, meaning there are effectively ZERO real units currently in the pipeline. With 173 units on-hand and an average weekly demand of ~83 over the last 5 periods (P19-P23), we must ensure the backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) period demand window despite the 791-unit deduction. I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (Forecasted Mean * (L+1)) + Safety Stock + Phantom Correction. Given current demand trends and the high holding cost ($1), a base stock covering ~3 periods (L=2) of demand (~250 units) plus the 791 phantom units is required. Target mu_hat = ~1041. I will set mu_hat to 1100 to ensure the backend places a replenishment order this period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P25 (late July). Historical demand for these Jersey leggings shows a downward trend entering summer, with a recent mean (last 5 periods) of approximately 77 units per week. The critical issue is 'phantom inventory'. We have 927 units reported as 'In-transit', but 791 of these are confirmed lost shipments across multiple periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). The OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. If we don't account for the lost units, the backend believes we have 791 more units than we actually do and will under-order, leading to stockouts. To fix this, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 77 = 231 units. Adjustment for phantom inventory: 231 + 791 = 1022. By setting mu_hat to 1022, the backend calculation (1022 - 927 = 95) will result in a reasonable order quantity to maintain service levels despite the system inaccuracies. Sigma is set to recent volatility to cover demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 791 units. Recent demand mean (P20-P24) is 77, indicating a settled lower-demand regime for summer.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's jersey leggings, which show steady but lower demand during summer (avg 77 units recently). The critical issue is the accumulation of 'phantom' inventory in the 'In-transit' field from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17), totaling 791 units. Since the OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from its base stock calculation, these 791 units must be added back to the mu_hat to ensure the backend doesn't erroneously assume we are overstocked. Base demand is calculated using a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) to capture the summer trend (avg ~75 units/period). With L=2, the required total target for (L+1) periods is (3 * 75) + 791 = 1016. Setting mu_hat to 1016 forces the backend to place orders when actual on-hand inventory drops, despite the 791 phantom units. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (N=10) to maintain a lean buffer for the summer regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 27 (2019-08-12). Item is a women's 2-pack long leggings (basic staple). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit shows 964 units, but significant phantom inventory exists. 

Phantom Inventory Analysis: Based on historical carry-overs, P1(164), P3(78), P4(111), P10(87), P13(134), P14(91), and P17(126) are confirmed lost. Total confirmed phantom inventory = 791 units. 
Recent order behavior: P24(136) was ordered 3 periods ago and hasn't arrived; P26(37) was ordered 1 period ago. Total real pipeline = 136 + 37 = 173 units. 
Calculated 'In-transit' = 964. Calculation Check: 964 (Reported) - 791 (Phantom) = 173 (Real). This matches. 

Demand Context: The current regime (P21-P26) shows lower summer demand averaging ~72.5 units/week. 

Strategy: The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - In-transit'. To prevent the 791 phantom units from suppressing orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. 
Calculated mu_hat for (L+1) periods (where L=2): Target Stock = (3 periods * ~73 units/period) + Safety Stock + Phantom Offset. 
Refined target: We need to cover 3 periods of demand (219 units) AND offset the 791 lost units that the backend subtracts. Total target base_stock = 1010 units. 
Using explicit mu_hat = 1010 ensures the OR engine places an order despite the massive 'In-transit' figure.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of recent lead times (P22: 1 period, P21: 2 periods, P20: 2 periods) shows that deliveries are occurring, but the 'In-transit' field is severely inflated by phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17). The current 'In-transit' of 1010 units is significantly higher than the actual pipeline of valid orders (P24: 136, P26: 37, P27: 46; Total valid = 219 units). Consequently, 791 units (1010 - 219) are confirmed phantom units that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from its base stock calculation. Demand has stabilized in a lower summer regime; the average demand for the last 8 periods (P20-P27) is approximately 72 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 791 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1075. This is calculated as: (Target Base Stock for 3 periods [72 * 3 = 216]) + (Phantom Offset [791]) + (Current Stockout Buffer [68]). Setting L to default (2) and sigma_hat to explicit (100) to maintain a healthy safety stock against continued lead-time volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 is currently facing a systemic stockout (On-hand: 0) while the system reports a large pipeline (In-transit: 1075). Based on carry-over insights, 791 of these units are confirmed lost/phantom shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17) that will never arrive. Additionally, the orders from P24 (136 units), P26 (37 units), and P27 (46 units) are now either overdue or at the limit of their promised lead time. The actual demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) has averaged 70.4 units, showing a slight uptick in the most recent period (95), possibly signaling the end of the summer low. To force an order from the backend despite the 1075 'In-transit' units, I must set mu_hat to be higher than (Current In-Transit - Phantom Units + Safety Stock). The calculation needed is: Target Inventory = (Phantom 791) + (Desired base stock for 3 periods). With L=2 and average demand ~75, the base stock should be ~225. Thus, mu_hat must be set to approximately 791 + 225 = 1016 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the need for physically arriving stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), we are entering the Fall season for leggings. Historical data from early January/February shows higher demand (avg ~120), while the summer (P20-P27) stabilized at a lower mean (~70-75). However, recent weeks (P28-P29) show some volatility. The primary challenge is the significant 'phantom inventory' in the In-transit field. We have 1075 units listed as In-transit, but based on the carry-over history, a large portion of these are confirmed lost shipments that will never arrive: P1 (164), P3 (78), P4 (111), P10 (87), P13 (134), P14 (91), P17 (126), and now potentially P24 (136) which is 6 periods old, totaling 927 phantom units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1075 from its base stock calculation. To prevent the system from under-ordering due to these 927 non-existent units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the upcoming (L+1=3) period demand at approximately 80 units/period (240 total) and add the 927 phantom units to bypass the backend's subtraction. Total mu_hat = 240 + 927 = 1167. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent demand variability while ignoring the early-year peaks.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 927 units. New lost shipment candidate: Period 24 (136 units) is now 6 periods past order date (4 past promised) with no arrival or conclude message. Total phantom calculation: P1(164)+P3(78)+P4(111)+P10(87)+P13(134)+P14(91)+P17(126)+P24(136) = 927 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are seeing a seasonality shift as demand is rising (Period 30 demand was 120, up from the summer average of ~77). The primary challenge continues to be systemic 'phantom' inventory in the In-transit pipeline. Analysis shows that 927 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24) but still visible to the OR backend. With In-transit currently at 1056 units, only 129 units (orders from P26, P30) are actually expected to arrive. To prevent the backend from under-ordering by subtracting these 927 phantom units, I must use an explicit mu_hat. Base stock calculation: Target Stock = (Demand Forecast * (L+1)) + (z * Sigma). Recent demand (P28-P30) average is 93.3. For L=2, base demand is 93.3 * 3 = 280. Adding the phantom offset: 280 + 927 = 1207. I will set mu_hat to 1207 and sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to maintain a high service level during this demand recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand is trending upward as of Sept (P30: 120) signaling the end of the summer low-demand regime. Total phantom inventory remains 927 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Long leggings) is exiting the summer low-demand regime. Demand in P30 (120) and P31 (115) shows a significant increase compared to the July/August average (approx. 70-80). I am forecasting a mean demand of 120 units per period for the upcoming weeks. The system currently shows 1207 units 'In-transit', but most of this is 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) that will never arrive. Confirmed lost: P1(164), P3(78), P4(111), P10(87), P13(134), P14(91), P17(126), P24(136). Additionally, the P26 order (37 units) is now 5 periods old (3 periods past promised) and P25 (0 units ordered) has passed. P26 is now also considered lost. Total phantom inventory = 927 + 37 = 964 units. Effective pipeline inventory = 1207 - 964 = 243 units. The OR backend calculates base_stock - In-transit. To ensure an order is actually placed to meet the new demand of 120/period (target base stock for L=2: (2+1)*120 = 360), I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets the phantom 964 units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (360) + Phantom Units (964) = 1324. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set this target, bypassing the backend's flawed pipeline subtraction.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 964 units. New lost shipment: Period 26 (37 units) is now 6 periods past order date (4 past promised) with no conclude message. Total phantom calculation: P1(164)+P3(78)+P4(111)+P10(87)+P13(134)+P14(91)+P17(126)+P24(136)+P26(37) = 964 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (September 23), demand is showing a clear upward trend from the summer lows (averaging ~110 units over the last 3 periods), consistent with seasonal expectations for leggings. Total 'In-transit' inventory is 1081 units, but a significant portion is confirmed phantom inventory from lost shipments. The updated phantom inventory count is 964 units, comprising lost orders from Periods 1(164), 3(78), 4(111), 10(87), 13(134), 14(91), 17(126), 24(136), and 26(37). This leaves a real pipeline of only 117 units (the P32 order). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these non-existent 964 units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The forecast demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is approximately 110 * 3 = 330 units. Adding the 964 phantom units to offset the backend's deduction results in an explicit mu_hat of 1294. I'll use a slightly elevated sigma_hat to account for recent demand volatility (~110-120 range).

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 964 units. Most recent loss: Period 26. Real pipeline contains only 117 units (from P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30, 2019), demand is trending upward following the summer low, with the most recent demand (P33) at 133 units. The 'In-transit' field reports 1147 units, but the Carry-over Insights confirm 964 units are 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26). This leaves a real pipeline of only 183 units (P32: 117, P33: 66). Based on the 2-period lead time, we expect P32's 117 units to arrive during this period (P34). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 964 phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is (1+L) * Forecasted_Mean + Phantom_Units. With L=2 and a forecasted mean of 115 (reflecting the Sept upturn), the requirement is (3 * 115) + 964 = 1309. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current demand shift.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the product 688432001 (Women's Leggings) has 0 units on-hand and 1,295 units reported as In-transit. However, a significant portion of this pipeline is 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were never delivered but remain in the system's calculation. Based on history, orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17, 24, and 26 are confirmed lost, totaling 964 phantom units. Additionally, the Period 32 order (117 units) and Period 33 order (66 units) are now overdue (promised lead time 2), with P32 being 3 periods old and P33 being 2 periods old. Since P32 and P33 have not concluded, they are added to the phantom tally: 964 + 117 + 66 = 1147 phantom units. The true pipeline likely only contains the Period 34 order (148 units). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high 'In-transit' figure, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS the phantom inventory. Recent demand (P30-P34) averages ~110 units/period. For L=2, (1+L)*110 = 330 units. Adding the 1147 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1477. This calculation tells the backend: 'I need enough stock to cover 1477 units', and since it sees ~1295 in transit, it will order the difference to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 1147 units. New lost shipments: Period 32 (117 units) and Period 33 (66 units) are 2+ periods past promised delivery without concluding. Total phantom: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26, P32, P33.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-October. Current demand exhibits seasonality, dropping to 53 in P35, but historical pre-winter patterns suggest high variance. A significant challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' field. Total confirmed lost shipments are P1 (164), P3 (78), P4 (111), P10 (87), P13 (134), P14 (91), P17 (126), P24 (136), P26 (37), P32 (117), and P33 (66), totaling 1,147 units. The system shows 1,360 units in-transit, meaning only 213 units (from P34: 148 and P35: 182, though P34 is currently 1 period late) are potentially valid. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1,360 from the base_stock, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 1,147 phantom units. I will forecast a 'real' base stock requirement of approximately 360 units (reflecting ~120 units/period over L+1) and add 1,147 to this to bypass the backend's deduction. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect recent arrival delays (P32 took 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' increased to 1147 units. New lost shipments: Period 32 (117 units) and Period 33 (66 units) are confirmed lost after failing to arrive within promised windows. Calculation: P1(164)+P3(78)+P4(111)+P10(87)+P13(134)+P14(91)+P17(126)+P24(136)+P26(37)+P32(117)+P33(66) = 1147 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 688432001 (Women's Leggings) is moving into late October. Currently, on-hand inventory is 254 units. The In-transit field shows 1195 units, but 1147 of those are confirmed lost 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26, P32, P33) that remain in the system's pipeline inventory count. The P32 and P33 orders were initially thought lost but actually arrived in P35 and P36 with a 3-period lead time. However, many older orders are permanently gone yet still subtract from the backend's base stock calculation. Total phantom inventory calculation: 164+78+111+87+134+91+126+136+37+117+66 = 1147 units. The 117 and 66 units arrived last period/this period (as shown in P35/P36 conclude), so they are removed from the phantom list, leaving 964 units of true phantom inventory: P1(164)+P3(78)+P4(111)+P10(87)+P13(134)+P14(91)+P17(126)+P24(136)+P26(37) = 964. Recent demand (P34-P36) is lower (avg 65), but the system needs a massive mu_hat to overcome the 964 phantom units. I will set mu_hat to 1250 to ensure the order (mu_hat - phantom) at least covers current weekly demand and prevents stockouts caused by the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Phantom inventory calculation updated. Orders from P32 and P33 actually arrived late (P35/P36). The current persistent phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is 964 units: P1(164), P3(78), P4(111), P10(87), P13(134), P14(91), P17(126), P24(136), P26(37). Demand mean for the last 3 periods is ~65.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has dropped significantly over the last three periods (53, 58, 29), suggesting a post-September cooling or shift in regime. The 'In-transit' field (1195 units) contains a massive amount of phantom inventory. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, 964 units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17, 24, and 26. These units will never arrive but the backend OR engine subtracts them from the base stock. To prevent under-ordering, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover (Demand_forecast * (1+L)) + Phantom_Inventory. Forecast for the next three periods (L=2) is approximately 50-60 units per period. Thus, desired base stock is (60 * 3) + 964 = 1144. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this value is communicated directly. sigma_hat is sets to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the high-demand September period.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime has shifted downward in October; mean demand of last 3 periods is 47 units. Phantom inventory remains static at 964 units.

The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand has transitioned into a lower autumn regime (P37: 29, P38: 40) compared to the Sept/early Oct levels. On-hand inventory is 185 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of current demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 1195 contains 964 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, and P26 that never arrived and are long past any reasonable lead time). The OR backend subtracts this 1195 from the base stock calculation; to prevent the stock-out that would result from the backend thinking we are over-supplied, mu_hat must be set to offset this phantom volume. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1195 + expected demand for the lead time (3 periods * ~45 = 135) to ensure the system places an order if needed. Given current on-hand of 185 and recent demand of ~35-40, we are currently safe, but the explicit mu_hat protects against the backend's flawed pipeline view.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent demand (P37-P39) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~38 units per period, likely due to a seasonal shift for leggings. The phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' field remains a significant issue. As of Period 39 conclude, the 'In-transit' logically contains: P34 (148 units) and the consolidated phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26 = 964 units). Total visible In-transit (1112) - P34 (148) = 964 phantom units. These are units the OR backend thinks are coming but actually won't, leading it to under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Target Base Stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 38 = 114. Total mu_hat = 114 + 964 = 1078. This forces the backend to place an order despite the 1112 units in transit. On-hand is healthy at 222, so no immediate stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand has settled into a low-volume regime (approx. 38/period) since Period 37. Phantom inventory remains confirmed at 964 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product (Ladies Leggings/Womens Everyday Basics) has settled into a significant low-demand regime since mid-October, with the last four periods averaging 37.75 units (Period 37-40). The phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains at 964 units, calculated as the sum of lost orders: P1(164)+P3(78)+P4(111)+P10(87)+P13(134)+P14(91)+P17(126)+P24(136)+P26(37). Any valid units from recent orders (P34: 148, P35: 182, P36: 83) have mostly arrived, explaining the increase in actual on-hand inventory (186). Because 'In-transit' is 1112 and 964 are phantom, the backend sees 148 units (Period 34 order) as still validly in-transit. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 964 phantom units, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that adds this phantom volume to the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods. Using L=2 (L+1=3), the base forecast is 38 * 3 = 114. Adding 964 results in a mu_hat of 1078. This overrides the backend's deduction of non-existent stock. I will also use explicit sigma_hat to account for the current lower volatility in this regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has consistently dropped in Oct/Nov, with the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging approx. 35 units/period, compared to the higher Sept levels. This represents a sustained low-demand regime. On-hand inventory is 164 units, which covers ~4.5 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' field shows 1112 units, but our carry-over analysis indicates that 964 of these are 'phantom' units from lost historical shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26) that will never arrive. The adjusted real pipeline is 148 units (ordered Period 34, currently 8 periods old and also likely lost, though not yet confirmed) and 0 recent orders. Because the backend subtracts the full 1112 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, it will never place an order unless we explicitly override mu_hat to offset these 964 phantom units. I am setting an explicit mu_hat to (1+L)*35 + 964 = (3*35) + 964 = 1069. This ensures that the base stock (1069) minus pipeline (1112) results in a small or zero order, preventing excessive stock while compensating for the backend's miscalculation and protecting against the eventual depletion of on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime established at ~35 units/period (P37-P41). Total phantom inventory remains 964 units. Order from Period 34 (148 units) is now 8 periods old and highly likely lost, but will monitor for one more period before adding to phantom calculation.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent demand had settled into a low-volume regime (~35 units/period), but Period 42 showed a sharp spike to 140 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for women's leggings. Historical phantom inventory (lost shipments) in the 'In-transit' field is confirmed at 964 units: P1(164), P3(78), P4(111), P10(87), P13(134), P14(91), P17(126), P24(136), P26(37). Additionally, the order from Period 34 (148 units) is now 8 periods overdue (promised 2) and is officially added to the phantom tally. Total phantom inventory = 964 + 148 = 1112 units. This exactly matches the 'In-transit' figure, meaning the pipeline is effectively empty. To protect against the backend subtracting this non-existent 1112 units from the order and to account for the holiday demand spike, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the base stock needs to cover the current demand regime + the holiday spike. Taking a 3-week average including the spike (approx 66/period) across (L+1)=3 periods gives 198. To this, I must add the 1112 phantom units that the backend will subtract, resulting in a mu_hat of 1310. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Period 34 order (148 units) confirmed lost (8 periods since order). Total confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is now 1112 units. Period 42 confirms a significant holiday demand spike (140 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). In Period 42, we observed a significant holiday demand spike (140 units), followed by 86 units in Period 43. This confirms we have exited the low-demand autumn regime (~35 units/period) and entered the peak holiday season. Total 'In-transit' is 1286 units, but 1112 of these are confirmed phantom units (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34). The real pipeline inventory consists only of the 174 units ordered in Period 43. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to phantom inventory, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected holiday demand mean is ~115 (avg of P42-43). With L=2, base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods, which is 345 units. To offset the 1112 phantom units that the backend will subtract from its order calculation, I must set mu_hat = 345 + 1112 = 1457. This ensures the backend places an order sufficient to cover the 345 units required for the holiday period, as On-hand is currently 0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are approaching the end of the year. The historical data and calendar indicate high volatility: Period 42 saw a major spike (140), followed by 86 in Period 43, then a crash to 18 in Period 44 (likely due to stockouts or timing). The item is a 'Jersey leggings 2-pack', which typically sees high demand during the holiday/winter season. Total 'In-transit' is 1457 units, but 1112 of these are confirmed phantom (lost) units from periods P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26, and P34. This leaves only 345 units of 'real' pipeline inventory (P43: 174 and P44: 171). With 0 on-hand, we are currently stock-out. The goal is to set parameters so the OR engine orders enough to cover the holiday demand while the backend wrongly thinks we have 1112 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to offset the phantom inventory. Expected demand for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 300 (averaging recent variability and seasonal peak). To bypass the phantom inventory deduction, I set mu_hat = (Expected 3-period Demand) + (Phantom Inventory) = 300 + 1112 = 1412. Sigma_hat is set high to reflect recent extreme holiday variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 1112 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34). Real pipeline consists only of P43 (174) and P44 (171). Holiday demand peak observed in Dec (average ~80/week over P42-P43).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 falls on Dec 23rd, just before the Christmas holiday. Historical data for this period (P42=140, P43=86) shows a demand spike, but the most recent sample (P45=37) reflects the immediate pre-holiday lull. Total 'In-transit' is 1283, but 1112 of these are confirmed phantom units (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26, P34). The only real pipeline units are from P44 (171 units). With On-hand = 137 and real pipeline = 171, we have 308 usable units. To counter the OR backend's use of 1283 as pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate holiday/post-holiday demand mean at ~60 per period. Over (L+1)=3 periods, this is 180 units. To neutralize the phantom 1112 units, mu_hat is set to 180 + 1112 = 1292. This ensures the backend (Base Stock = mu_hat - Pipeline) actually orders enough to maintain a real stock level for the expected 60-unit demand regime while also being capped by the safety mechanism.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, transitioning out of the Christmas/Holiday peak for women's leggings. Demand in Period 42-43 showed a holiday spike (avg ~113), but has since dropped significantly (P44-P46 avg ~22). Total in-transit inventory is 1283 units, of which 1112 units are confirmed phantom/lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17, 24, 26, and 34. The actual pipeline consists of 171 units ordered in Period 44 (expected to arrive in P47). On-hand inventory is 124 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1283 units as available supply (which would result in zero ordering), I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that offsets the 1112 phantom units. The target inventory level for L=2 (covering 3 periods of demand) should be roughly 210 units (based on a post-holiday demand forecast of ~70/period to avoid stockouts if demand recovers in Jan). Calculation: Target (210) + Phantoms (1112) = 1322. Applying 'explicit' mu_hat of 1322 forces the backend to recognize the need for stock despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure.
