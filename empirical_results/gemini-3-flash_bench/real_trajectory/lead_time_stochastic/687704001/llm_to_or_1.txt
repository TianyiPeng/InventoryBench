Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Ladies Denim Super-Skinny Ankle Jeans'. Demand for the last three historical periods (Jan 21, Jan 28, Feb 04) has shown a significant upward trend: 56, 216, and 319. This suggests the product is ramping up in early spring. The promised lead time (L) is 2. I will set the demand forecast based on the most recent 3 observations (N=3) to capture this growth phase. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=3. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect current volatility. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 2. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (2+1) = 3 weeks of demand, which is appropriate for a spring fashion item seeing increasing sales.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a pair of ladies' skinny jeans ('Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W'). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 56, 216, 319, followed by 276 in Period 1. This suggests a post-launch growth phase. The current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (415 units, placed in Period 1) has not arrived yet. Since the promised lead time is 2, we expect this order to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We have 415 units in transit, which should cover near-term demand once they arrive. To set parameters, I am using a recent window (N=3) for demand to capture the current high-demand regime (avg approx 270) rather than including the zeros from the brand launch. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, N=3 covers the last three active demand periods (216, 319, 276).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a pair of Ladies Denim trousers ('Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W'). Current date is 2019/2/25. Looking at the five pre-game demand samples (0, 0, 56, 216, 319) and the two in-game demand observations (276, 207), we see a clear ramp-up from zero in early January to a sustained level in late January and February. The average of the last 4 observations (2019-01-28 to 2019-02-18) is approximately 254 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, and since we are only at Period 3, we expect the first order (placed Period 1) to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 771 in-transit (415 + 356), which is consistent. For OR parameters: L is set to 'default' (2). mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current active demand regime (approx 254/wk * (1+L) = 762 total). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the volatility in this active sales period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting late January (Period 2019-01-21); previous weeks were zero, now averaging ~254 units/week.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Analysis of the product (Ladies Super-Skinny Ankle Jeans) and demand history shows a clear shift. The first two historical weeks were zero, followed by a surge in late Jan/early Feb. Recent demand in the concluded periods (P1: 276, P2: 207, P3: 163) averages 215.3 units. The 'Carry-over insight' correctly identified a regime shift, but the demand appears to be softening slightly compared to the immediate late-Jan peak. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (ordered=415) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message, but it shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential 1-period delay or that the order arrives exactly at the start of Period 4. I will adjust L to 3 to reflect this likely delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the active demand period since Jan 21, including historical samples and concluded periods. Sigma_hat will use the same window to reflect current volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. We are managing super-skinny ankle jeans. We have observed a demand regime change starting in late January; the last three weeks have seen demand of 163, 184, and a starting trend around 200-250 units. Importantly, the Period 2 order (356 units) arrived in Period 4, confirming the promised lead time (L=2). The Period 1 order (415 units) is currently overdue; it should have arrived in Period 3. Because it hasn't arrived by Period 5, I am treating it as potentially lost or significantly delayed, which explains why we have 771 units in-transit (415 from P1 + 143 from P3 + 213 from P4). To ensure availability despite the missing Period 1 shipment, I will maintain L=2 but use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable demand level (~187 avg) while allowing the OR backend's safety stock calculation to handle volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the backend will naturally target a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential shipment loss/significant delay for Period 1 order (415 units); expected arrival was Period 3, still not concluding by Period 5.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W', a staple denim item. History analysis: 1) Demand: Following an initial spike in late January/early Feb, demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (276, 207, 163, 184, 158), averaging ~198 units/week. 2) Lead Time and Shipments: The promised lead time is 2. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (2 periods). However, the Period 1 order (415 units) is now 3 periods overdue (should have arrived in P3) and the Period 3 order (143 units) should have arrived in P5 but is also missing. This suggests a pattern of lost shipments or a significant logistical failure. On-hand is critically low (14 units). We have 771 units in transit (P1, P3, P4, P5), but since P1 and P3 are likely lost, 'pipeline inventory' is overstating actual availability. To force the OR backend to place a recovery order despite the high 'in-transit' figure, I will set 'explicit' mu_hat to a high value that exceeds the suspect pipeline and use 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the nominal cycle we want to maintain.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Multiple shipment losses confirmed. Period 1 (415 units) and Period 3 (143 units) have failed to arrive by Period 5, totaling 558 lost units. Only Period 2 shipment arrived on time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand following a stockout in Period 6. Demand for this Ladies Denim item has stabilized over the last 4 weeks (Periods 3-6) at an average of 158.5 units/week. We have a severe supply chain reliability issue: shipments from Period 1 (415 units), Period 3 (143 units), and Period 4 (213 units) have not arrived, while only the Period 2 order arrived as scheduled. Period 1 is now 4 periods past its promised delivery date, Period 3 is 2 past, and Period 4 is 1 past. Because lost orders do not 'conclude' and stay in 'In-transit', the OR backend's inventory calculation (on-hand + in-transit) significantly overestimates available stock, preventing it from placing new orders. To force the backend to re-order and restore service level, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 1167, which covers the expected demand for the next 3 weeks (current period + 2 weeks lead time) based on the recent average (~475 units total) plus an offset of roughly 692 units to compensate for the major lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) still clogging the lead-time pipeline. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the 'ghost' in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Supply chain failure highly probable; 771 units (P1, P3, P4 orders) are significantly overdue and likely lost, causing ongoing stockouts. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' pants has stabilized around 160 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1 (Period 8). We are facing a severe stockout following a supply chain failure. Orders from Period 1 (415 units), Period 3 (143 units), and Period 4 (213 units) are now multiple periods past their promised 2-period lead time and have not concluded, confirming they are likely lost. Total lost units amount to 771. The only successful arrival was the Period 2 order in Period 4. Demand for these 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans has stabilized in a new regime: the average demand over the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) is approximately 160.6 units/week. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 479 units (ordered Period 6, expected Period 8 conclude) and the 771 presumed lost units, the OR backend's inventory calculation (on-hand + in-transit) significantly overestimates available stock by ~771 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the current demand (~161) plus a recovery factor to compensate for the lost pipeline, targeting a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Supply chain failure confirmed for orders from P1, P3, and P4 (total 771 units lost). Current demand regime for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans is stable at ~161 units/week (Periods 3-7 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3381.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, a shipment of 479 units (ordered in P6) arrived exactly on time (L=2), resolving the immediate stockout. However, shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 771 units) are now 5-7 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 771 units is phantom inventory that will never arrive. The current demand regime for the 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans remains stable; the average demand from Period 3 onwards (when the zero-demand phase ended) is approximately 172 units/week (163, 184, 158, 129, 169, 193). For the OR backend calculation: L=2 (promised and recently observed), mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand (3 * 172 = 516), and sigma_hat will be based on the recent stable regime (N=6). Because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (771) from the base stock, and 771 units are lost, I must compensate by setting mu_hat explicitly high or acknowledging that the backend will order nothing if it believes 771 units are coming. Given the OR logic [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)], and pipeline_inventory=771, the system will not order until on-hand + (real) in-transit falls below the base stock. I will set mu_hat at 516 to match the current demand rate, but the presence of the phantom 771 units in 'In-transit' ensures no new order will be placed this period, which is appropriate as we currently have 286 on-hand (approx 1.6 weeks of stock).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans. Demand has reached a stable regime following an initial spike; the average demand from Period 3 onwards is approximately 163 units/week (last 7 weeks: 163, 184, 158, 129, 169, 193, 104). We are currently in Spring, and this basic denim item shows consistent demand with high volatility (sigma). Regarding supply, we have confirmed the total loss of 771 units across three shipments (Period 1, 3, and 4), as they have not arrived for 6+ periods beyond the promised L=2. These units remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places a new order to replenish inventory, I will set 'mu_hat' explicitly based on the recent stable demand of ~163 units/week for (L+1) periods (3 * 163 = 489). I am using 'explicit' because the OR engine's 'pipeline' calculation still includes the 771 lost units; by setting 'mu_hat' high enough to account for the actual needs despite that phantom pipeline, we trigger necessary orders. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods based on the successful arrival of Period 2 and Period 6 orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans is stable at ~163 units/week (Periods 3-9). Lost pipeline inventory (771 units) continues to distort standard logic, requiring explicit parameter adjustment to maintain service levels.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-22 (Period 11). The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans. Historical demand from Period 3 onwards (when initial zeros ceased) shows a mean of approximately 152 units/week. However, recent demand (last 2 weeks) has dropped to 104 and 81, suggesting a potential downward trend or shift, though it's too early to call it a sustained new regime. The inventory situation is critical: we have 101 units on hand, but the 'In-transit' figure of 771 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are long overdue (9, 7, and 6 periods late, respectively) and confirmed lost per carry-over insights. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL pipeline inventory (including these lost 771 units) from the target base stock, it will never place a new order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset that ghost inventory. To force an order that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3) plus a safety buffer, I am using the 'explicit' method. I calculate a desired base stock of ~550 units (approx. 150 mean * 3 periods + buffer). To counter the 771 units of 'ghost' inventory being subtracted, I set mu_hat to 1350. This ensures (1350 - 771) results in a meaningful net order to replenish the 101 units on hand and protect against stockout in Period 13.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially softening: last two periods (9-10) averaged 92.5 units vs historical 160. Monitoring for sustained downward regime shift.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans has shown a significant softening over the last three periods (P9: 104, P10: 81, P11: 90), averaging approx. 92 units/week, compared to the previous regime of ~160. This confirms the downward shift noted in the Carry-over Insight from Period 11. The supply chain remains highly unreliable: while Period 2 and Period 6 orders arrived with the promised 2-period lead time, orders from Period 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 771 units) are long overdue and must be considered lost. The pipeline currently shows 1,286 units (771 lost + 515 ordered in P11). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline from its calculated base stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to bypass the distortion caused by these lost units. I set L to the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat, I forecast demand for (L+1)=3 periods based on the recent softening regime: 92 * 3 = 276. For sigma_hat, I use a lower volatility estimate reflecting the tighter range of recent demand (std dev ~12 over last 3 periods, scaled: sqrt(3)*12 \u2248 21).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 9: average halved from ~160 to ~92 units/week. Supply chain loss pattern persists: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (771 units total) are definitively lost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans has shifted from ~160 units/week to a lower regime of ~92 units/week (average of Periods 9-12). The pipeline inventory of 1286 units is highly misleading because it includes 771 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are now at least 9 periods past their scheduled arrival and are definitively lost. The remaining valid in-transit units are from Period 11 (515 units), which should arrive in Period 13 (visible in P14). Since on-hand is currently 0 and we have a confirmed lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to avoid over-ordering against the phantom pipeline. Lead time is set to 2 based on the only successful arrivals (P4 and P8). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the lower mean and reduced variance of the current regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' is currently in a sustained lower demand regime that began around Period 9. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 86.8 units/week. This is significantly lower than the previous average of ~163 units/week. Lead times for successful arrivals (P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13) are consistently 2 periods. The 771 units in 'In-transit' are the lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4; these effectively disappear from the OR engine's pipeline calculation because they will never arrive, but they still populate the backend's 'In-transit' figure. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I use an explicit 'mu_hat' that reflects the current demand regime and ensures the safety stock targets (L+1 periods) are met, while keeping L at the promised 2. With 449 units on hand and a weekly demand of ~87, we have approximately 5 weeks of cover, so no new order is immediately necessary, but parameters must be set to reflect the current reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains lower: average for Periods 9-13 is 86.8 units/week, confirming the shift downward from the previous 160+ average.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Ladies Denim) is in a confirmed lower demand regime that started at Period 9. The average demand for the most recent 6 weeks (Periods 9-14) is approximately 82.2 units per week, significantly down from the earlier 160+ average. The current date (May 20) does not suggest an immediate seasonal spike for heavy denim. Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 2 periods. History confirms two successful arrivals at exactly 2 periods (P4 and P8 concludes), while also confirming that 771 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are lost as they are many weeks overdue. The on-hand inventory is 390 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (82 units/week). Since the OR engine's base-stock calculation considers 'In-transit' (771 units) as valid inventory, and these units are lost, I must set parameters that prevent the logic from incorrectly assuming we are overstocked. By using recent_N for mu_hat (N=6), the backend will correctly target a lower base stock (~246 units plus safety) suitable for the current demand. Given on-hand (390) > target base stock, the system will naturally hold off on ordering until inventory depletes, which is appropriate given the current surplus and seasonal context.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Embrace S.Skinny jeans) is in a sustained low-demand regime that began around Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 15 is 77.3 units per week, which is significantly lower than the ~160 units observed in the earlier spring months. Specifically, the last three periods (13-15) show a further softening (66, 59, 48), suggesting demand may be tapering as we approach summer. On-hand inventory is currently 342 units, which covers more than 4 weeks of the current demand rate (~77 units/week). Importantly, the 'In-transit' figure of 771 units represents the orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost (now 12+ periods overdue). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' pipeline from the base stock calculation, a standard policy would prevent any new ordering even if stock ran out. To account for this, I must set the target mu_hat high enough to 'push through' the 771 units of phantom inventory when new orders are eventually needed, or use recent_N to reflect the current mean. However, with 342 on-hand, we have sufficient safety stock for several periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the start of the lower regime) to align the backend with the current demand level of ~77 units/week. Lead time (L) remains 2 based on successful recent arrivals (P6 and P11).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 13 shows further softening below previous shift: average for Periods 13-15 is 57.7 units/week (down from 92/week in Periods 9-12).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03 (Period 17). The product is 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans. A sustained downward demand regime shift is observed: the initial average was ~160, dropped to ~92 (Periods 9-12), and has further softened to ~52 units/week over the last 4 periods (P13: 66, P14: 59, P15: 48, P16: 34). There is a confirmed supply chain issue where 771 units (ordered in P1, P3, P4) are definitively lost but still occupy the OR engine's 'in-transit' logic. Currently, we have 308 units on-hand, which at the current demand rate (~52/week) covers approximately 6 weeks of supply. Since 6 weeks > L+1 (3 weeks), no new order is needed. To prevent the OR engine from ordering due to the 771 units being correctly 'counted' as lost in reality but 'in-transit' in the system, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=4). This ensures the base stock stays below the effective inventory (on-hand + actual in-transit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 13 confirms a further downward shift: average for Periods 13-16 is 51.75 units/week.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans continues a clear downward trajectory. The most recent regime (starting Period 13) shows an average of 47.6 units over the last 5 periods (66, 59, 48, 34, 31). Current on-hand inventory is 277 units, which at the current burn rate covers approximately 5-6 weeks. The 771 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed losses from Periods 1, 3, and 4 and will not arrive, but they persist in the OR backend's pipeline calculation. To prevent the backend from incorrectly suppressing orders due to these 'phantom units', I must set a high base stock or adjust parameters to account for the truth. However, since on-hand inventory (277) is already significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (1+2 periods * ~48 = 144 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current softened demand and maintain the default L=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 13 confirms a sustained downward shift: average for Periods 13-17 is 47.6 units/week, down from previous regimes (160 and 92).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans continues a clear downward trend. The current regime, which began around Period 13 (early May), has shown a steady decline in weekly sales (66, 59, 48, 34, 31, 22). The average demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 13-18) is approximately 43.3 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 255 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the expected demand for the next $(L+1) = 3$ periods (approx. 130 units), especially considering we are entering the mid-summer period (June 17) where denim demand often softens. The 'In-transit' figure of 771 units represents the verified lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4; these are treated as permanent pipeline inventory by the OR engine, preventing it from ordering until on-hand levels drop drastically. Since we are overstocked relative to the current low-demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to align mu_hat and sigma_hat with the current downward trajectory and ensure no unnecessary orders are placed while holding costs accumulate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 13 (2019/5/6) shows a consistent granular decline: average for Periods 13-18 is 43.3 units/week, with the most recent period dropping to 22 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans continues its downward trajectory. Since Period 13, the weekly demand has averaged 40 units/week (66, 59, 48, 34, 31, 22, 20). The most recent three periods (17-19) show a further decline to an average of 24.3 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 235 units, which provides approximately 9-10 weeks of coverage at the latest demand rate. The 771 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4; however, because they remain in the pipeline inventory, the OR backend's capped policy will prevent new orders from being placed until on-hand inventory is depleted or the logic is adjusted. Given the high current stock relative to the declining demand, there is no immediate risk of stockout. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, since Period 13) to capture this lower regime and prevent over-ordering once the lost units are eventually cleared or more stock is needed. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat yields a per-period average of ~40, leading to a target including lead time of roughly 120 units, well below current on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 13 shows a steady decline: 7-period average is 40 units/week, with the last 3 weeks averaging 24.3 units. Inventory levels (235) are currently excessive for the current demand rate.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans continues a sharp downward trajectory. The most recent demand (Period 20) was only 5 units, and the average for the last 4 weeks is approximately 19.5 units. With an on-hand inventory of 230 units, the current stock covers nearly 12 weeks of demand at the latest rate. The 771 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 and do not represent actual incoming stock. Therefore, there is no need to place new orders. To prevent the OR backend from ordering against the ghost 'In-transit' inventory or over-ordering due to historical high-demand averages, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the low-demand regime, and keeping L at 'default' (2 periods). This configuration will result in zero new orders while maintaining visibility on the current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 13 continues to decline significantly: 4-period average (P17-P20) is 19.5 units/week, with the most recent week dropping to 5 units. Current inventory of 230 is highly excessive (>10 weeks cover).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Embrace S.Skinny Ankle H.W' jeans (687704001) is experiencing a severe and sustained demand decline. Since Period 13, demand has dropped consistently, with the last five periods (P17-P21) averaging only 17.4 units/week and the last two periods averaging 7 units. On-hand inventory is 221 units, which at the recent average of 17 units/week, represents over 12 weeks of stock. The 'In-transit' figure of 771 units is composed of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4; this phantom inventory continues to distort the lead-time pipeline calculation, but since on-hand stock is already far above any reasonable base stock level, this distortion will correctly result in zero orders. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 17-21) to reflect this low-demand regime and prevent any further ordering while liquidating current high inventory levels. The L parameter remains at default as there are no recent arrivals to recalculate actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 (2019/6/3) confirms a severe contraction: 5-period average is 17.4 units/week (down from initial peaks of ~160 and subsequent ~90). Inventory levels are currently sufficient for >10 weeks.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans remains in a deep contraction phase. Looking at the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has been 31, 22, 20, 5, 9, 9, resulting in an average of 16.0 units per week. The most recent three weeks (P20-P22) have averaged only 7.6 units. With an on-hand inventory of 212 units, we currently hold over 25 weeks of supply based on the most recent demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 771 units represents the previously identified lost orders from P1, P3, and P4, which the OR backend continues to count as pipeline inventory. Because on-hand inventory is already significantly above any reasonable base stock level for the current regime, the primary goal is to avoid ordering and minimize holding costs while the existing stock depletes. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to reflect the current low-demand regime, and default for others to let the high stock level naturally prevent new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 (2019/06/03) is stable at a very low level, averaging 16.0 units/week over 6 periods. Inventory levels (212) represent ~13 weeks of cover at current rates.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans remains in a deep trough, with recent weekly demands of 5, 9, 9, and 6 units (Period 20-23 average = 7.25). This is significantly lower than the previous regime (Period 17-22 avg = 16.0). The product, being a high-waist skinny jean, may be seeing a sharp off-season drop in July. Currently, there are 206 units on-hand with 0 units sold in most recent periods relative to that stock, providing approximately 28 weeks of cover at current demand rates. The system still shows 771 units 'In-transit', which are the lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (415 + 143 + 213 = 771). Because on-hand inventory is massively excessive for the current demand regime, I will continue to set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed. I will use a recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 17-23). This results in a base stock level far below current inventory, preventing unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 20 (2019/06/24) has further contracted to an average of 7.25 units/week over 4 periods, down from the 16.0 units/week seen in the previous month.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Embrace S.Skinny jeans) is in a significant, multi-phase demand contraction. Since Period 13, demand has dropped consistently: Period 24 demand was 12 units, following a string of single-digit results (5, 9, 9, 6). The current 5-period average (P20-P24) is 8.2 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 194 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 23 weeks of sales, well beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods. The 'In-transit' value of 771 units represents the previously identified lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) which have never arrived and continue to distort the pipeline inventory calculation in the OR backend. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders due to this 'pipeline' distortion or even a low base-stock calculation, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to low values consistent with the current regime. Given the excessive on-hand inventory relative to demand, the primary goal is to avoid any new orders while the existing stock is liquidated.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 20 (2019/06/24) has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 8.2 units/week over 5 periods. Current on-hand inventory (194) provides >20 weeks of coverage.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 687704001 (Embrace S.Skinny jeans) has experienced a significant rebound in the most recent period (P25), jumping to 58 units after several weeks of single-digit demand. While the previous regime (P20-P24) averaged only 8.2 units/week, this new data point might signal a late-summer recovery or back-to-school interest. However, on-hand inventory remains high at 136 units, which still provides over 2 periods of coverage even at the spiked demand level (58) or several months of coverage if demand settles at a middle ground. The 'In-transit' figure of 771 units represents the previously identified lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which the OR backend continues to count as pipeline inventory. Given the high on-hand stock and the existing (albeit ghost) pipeline, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using a recent window to capture the potential slight recovery while maintaining a cautious approach to avoid over-ordering against the massive (though lost) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected in Period 25 (58 units) after a month-long low-demand regime (avg ~8 units). Monitoring to see if this is a sustained recovery or a one-off spike.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 687704001 (Embrace S.Skinny jeans) is showing a demand rebound. After a sustained period of very low demand (averaging ~8 units/week in Periods 20-24), the last two periods have seen a significant increase to 58 and 71 units, respectively. This suggests a potential return toward the previous regime of ~90 units/week or a seasonal mid-August lift (often associated with back-to-school timing in retail). On-hand inventory has dropped to 65 units. The 771 units listed as 'In-transit' are the confirmed lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4; the OR engine sees these as covers, so I must adjust parameters to ensure the engine triggers an order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate upward trend (averaging 64.5 units/week) and use 'explicit' lead time to ensure the engine accounts for the 2-period lag properly. This configuration should trigger a replenishment order to prevent a stockout in ~1-2 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed starting Period 25: 2-week average is 64.5 units, significantly up from the previous ~8 unit/week regime. Transitioning from depletion mode back to replenishment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Embrace S.Skinny Ankle jeans) is experiencing a significant demand rebound. After a prolonged low-demand period (averaging ~8 units/week in late June/early July), demand has increased for three consecutive weeks: 58 (P25), 71 (P26), and 101 (P27). This suggests a return to a higher demand regime, likely driven by late summer/back-to-school shopping. On-hand inventory is now 0, and the 771 units in-transit are confirmed lost from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (none have arrived in over 20 weeks). To prevent further stockouts (we lost 36 units in P27 due to 0 inventory), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current upward trend (avg ~76.7 units/week) and using explicit L=2 to match the promised lead time, ignoring the 'phantom' pipeline. Sigma_hat is calculated from the last 3 periods to account for the increasing volatility during this rebound.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 25 (2019/07/29) is sustained and accelerating: last 3 periods show 58, 71, 101 units, effectively transitioning from the previous <10 unit regime to a ~75+ unit regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a demand rebound phase (averaging ~76 units over the last 4 periods: 58, 71, 101, 74). On-hand inventory is depleted (0 units), and the pipeline contains 771 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, it will not place new orders as long as these 771 units stay in the pipeline. To override this, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (771 units) and covers the lead-time demand (L+1 = 3 periods). With recent demand averaging ~76 units, a 3-period demand is ~228 units. Estimating an additional 771 units to offset the lost pipeline yields 999. I will use 1000 for mu_hat to trigger an order that establishes a proper on-hand stock for the current demand regime. L=2 is maintained based on the last successful delivery (P13).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 25 is confirmed and stable. 4-period average (P25-P28) is 76 units/week, up from <10 units/week. Stockout currently in effect due to 0 on-hand and 771 units of 'zombie' pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Embrace S.Skinny' is experiencing a sustained demand recovery (rebound regime) starting in late July (Period 25). The last five periods (P25-P29) show demand of 58, 71, 101, 74, and 100, averaging ~81 units/week. This is a significant shift from the previous low-demand regime (<10 units/week). Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 1,052 units in pipeline inventory. However, 771 units are 'zombie' lost inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (confirmed by history and carry-over insights). Only the order from Period 29 (281 units) is active. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P29 order is expected in Period 31. This leaves a stockout gap for the current Period 30. To address this and prevent future stockouts, mu_hat is set to reflect the new 81 units/week regime. Given the supply chain's history of lost orders, the 'explicit' method for L is used to ensure the OR engine targets a sufficient base stock, while recognizing the in-transit 'zombie' units will continue to hinder automated ordering unless the target base stock exceeds the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from Period 25 (2019/07/29) is sustained: 5-period average (P25-P29) is 80.8 units/week. Stockout remains active due to 771 units of lost 'zombie' pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4) suppressing new automated orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans is in a sustained recovery phase starting Period 25. The most recent demand (Period 30) spiked to 157 units, bringing the 6-period average (P25-P30) to 93.5 units/week. However, the last two weeks (100, 157) suggest an accelerating upward trend. The current stockout is critical. The 'In-transit' balance of 1052 units includes 771 units from Period 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite these 'zombie' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~140 units/week (reflecting the recent acceleration), plus an additional 771 units to offset the phantom pipeline inventory. Total mu_hat = (140 * 3) + 771 = 1191. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 150 to account for high volatility during this recovery and to ensure a high service level while out of stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery accelerating: Period 30 demand reached 157 units, the highest since Period 8. The 2rd-half 2019 regime (P25-P30) now averages 93.5 units/week and is trending upward.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Embrace S.Skinny' is experiencing a sharp demand recovery. The 2019-09-09 (Period 31) demand was 161 units, confirming an upward trend since late July (P25). The most recent 3-week average is ~139 units/week. Lead time is consistently 2 periods when shipments succeed (P2, P6, P11). I must address the 'zombie' pipeline inventory (771 units from P1, P3, P4) which is likely lost but still counted by the OR backend. With In-transit at 1438, subtracting the 771 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 667 (matching the orders from P29 and P31). To force an order despite the zombie inventory, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' for (L+1)=3 periods. Targeting a base stock that covers 3 weeks of demand at ~160 units/week (= 480 units) plus a safety buffer, I'll set mu_hat to 1200. This high explicit value ensures the OR engine places an order even when subtracting the inflated pipeline (1200 - 1438 is negative, but the backend's capped policy will still trigger an order to bridge the gap between actual physical inventory and immediate needs as it perceives the mu_hat requirement).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery is accelerating: the last 3 periods (P29-P31) average 139.3 units/week, returning to levels seen in early 2019.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2534.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans has fully recovered and is now stabilizing at high levels, similar to the early 2019 peak. The last four recorded demands are 100, 157, 161, and 146 (averaging ~141 units/week). The 'arrived' message from Period 32 confirms a lead time shift: the order from P31 arrived in just 1 period (lead_time=1), though the order from P29 (281 units) remains missing after 3 periods, suggesting it may be lost like the P1, P3, and P4 shipments. Current on-hand is 240. The pipeline inventory is officially 1061, but includes 771 units from early 2019 (P1, P3, P4) and 281 units from P29 which are likely lost (total 'zombie' stock = 1052). Effectively, the pipeline is nearly empty. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the current ~141 units/week demand while accounting for the likely lost shipments, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand over (L+1) periods, where L is the promised 2, so (2+1)*141 = 423. I will keep L at default (2) to be safe, and use a recent_N sigma to capture the current volatility of the recovery.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: Period 31 order arrived in 1 period (P32), while Period 29 order (281 units) is now 1 period overdue and potentially lost. Total suspected lost pipeline inventory ('zombie stock') has increased to 1052 units (P1, P3, P4, P29).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' is experiencing a massive demand surge. Period 33 demand reached 342 units, a significant jump from the previous 150-160 range. The 3-period average (P31-P33) is now 216 units/week, indicating a new, high-growth regime. This has resulted in a complete stockout (0 on-hand). The inventory situation is complicated by 'zombie' pipeline stock: orders from P1, P3, P4 (771 units) and now likely P29 (281 units) are long overdue and presumed lost, totaling 1,052 units of phantom inventory. Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from its base stock calculation, it will not order enough unless I use 'explicit' values to bypass the 'zombie' stock distortion. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 220 units per week over (L+1=3) periods (660 units) and sigma_hat high (75) to reflect the recent volatility and prevent further stockouts. I will use L=2 (promised) as the base, noting that while P31 arrived in 1 period, P29 is lost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed Period 33: Demand spiked to 342 units, significantly above the previous recovery average of ~93. The 3-period average (P31-P33) is now 216 units. Total suspected lost pipeline inventory ('zombie stock') is 1052 units (P1, P3, P4, P29), which necessitates manually inflated parameters to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans has significantly accelerated in the current autumn season. The most recent demand figures (P31: 161, P32: 146, P33: 342, P34: 214) confirm a high-demand regime averaging 215.75 units/week over the last 4 periods. The pipeline inventory of 1704 is heavily distorted by 'zombie stock' (P1, P3, P4, P29) totaling 1052 units that are almost certainly lost and will never arrive. The OR engine subtracts this entire 1704 from the target base stock, preventing new orders unless parameters are manually inflated. To maintain a safe service level and clear the stockout, mu_hat must be set to cover the expected demand across (L+1) periods plus the 1052 lost units. Choosing L=2, expected demand = 216 * 3 = 648. Adding the 1052 lost units to this target results in a mu_hat of ~1700. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass standard calculations and force the backend to account for the lost pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Lost pipeline inventory ('zombie stock') confirmed at 1052 units (P1: 415, P3: 143, P4: 213, P29: 281). Observed lead times are volatile (P31 arrived in 1 period, while others are lost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand recovery/seasonal peak. Recent demand (P31-P35) averages approximately 210 units/week (161, 146, 342, 214, 190). The lead time remains highly volatile: P31 arrived in 1 period, P32 arrived in 3 periods, and P29 is now 6 periods overdue (confirmed lost). Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory (undelivered orders likely lost) is 1052 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). These 1052 units are subtracted from the base stock by the OR engine, preventing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat to cover both the real projected demand and the 1052-unit deficit. Calculation: Expected demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods) at 215 units/week = 645 units. Adding the 1052-unit 'zombie' buffer results in a mu_hat of ~1697. Setting sigma_hat to an explicit value of 250 to account for high demand variance and lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed 'zombie' pipeline inventory (likely lost) remains at 1052 units (P1, P3, P4, P29), suppressing automated orders. Current demand regime (P31-P35) stable at an average of 210 units/week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans remains in a high-demand regime, with Period 36 demand at 184 units. Over the last six periods (P31-P36), demand has averaged approximately 206 units per week. Lead times are highly volatile: P31 arrived in 1 period, P32 arrived in 3 periods, and P35 arrived in 1 period, while the P29 order and several early-year orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed as lost. This \u2018zombie\u2019 pipeline inventory (1052 units) continues to inflate the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' count, which would normally lead the OR engine to suppress new orders. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to encompass the expected demand across the lead time (3 periods) PLUS the volume of lost inventory. Since L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand (approx 618 units) plus the 1052 units of zombie stock, totaling 1670. Setting mu_hat to 1670 and keeping sigma_hat at an explicit value based on the current regime's variance ensures the OR engine places an order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues: P35 order arrived in 1 period (observed P37), while P32 took 3 periods. Total 'zombie' lost pipeline remains 1052 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). Demand regime P31-P36 is stable at 206.2 units/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P31-P37) remains high, averaging 221 units/week, with the most recent demand at 213 units. The supply chain continues to present significant challenges: there is a confirmed 'zombie' pipeline of 1052 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P29) that will likely never arrive but are still counted by the OR engine's pipeline inventory subtraction. Additionally, lead times are erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and despite an in-transit balance of 1866 units, 1052 of those are lost. To trigger necessary new orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock target beyond the 'zombie' inventory level. I set mu_hat based on (1+L) * average demand, plus the 1052 lost units to offset the backend subtraction. L=2 (promised), so Target = (1+2)*221 + 1052 = 1715. I will set mu_hat to 1715 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high demand volatility and lead time uncertainty.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans remains stable in its recovery phase, with the latest demand at 192 units and a 5-period average (P34-P38) of 198.6 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The primary challenge is the 'zombie' pipeline inventory: 1052 units from P1, P3, P4, and P29 are almost certainly lost but still visible to the OR engine. There are also newer orders in transit (P34: 643, P36: 171, P38: 96). Total in-transit is 1962. If we subtract the 1052 lost units, active 'real' pipeline is 910. However, the OR engine sees 1962. To force an order that covers (~200 units/week * 3 weeks = 600 units) while the OR engine thinks we have 1962 in transit, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = 600 (desired) + 1962 (to offset pipeline deduction) = 2562. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 2600 to trigger replenishment and ensure we cover demand despite the inventory data distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total 'zombie' lost pipeline inventory confirmed at 1052 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). Demand regime (P34-P38) is stable at ~199 units/week. Lead times remain volatile with recent observations of 1 and 3 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are managing a high-demand regime that stabilized around 200 units/week between Periods 34-38, though the most recent demand in Period 39 dropped to 124. The supply chain remains highly volatile with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, and the persistent 'zombie stock' issue (1052 units from P1, P3, P4, and P29 that have never arrived) continues to artificially inflate the pipeline inventory viewed by the OR backend. With an in-transit balance of 2676 units, only 1624 are 'live' (P34: 643, P38: 96, P39: 885). To ensure the backend places orders despite the zombie stock, I must set mu_hat to cover both the anticipated demand (approx. 200/week) and offset the 1052 units of lost inventory. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 1700 (calculated as (1+L)*200 + 1100 buffer) ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the corrupted pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for the high volatility in both demand and lead times.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Embrace S.Skinny jeans) is in a high-demand regime, though the last two periods (P39-P40) show a slight cooling to an average of 126.5 units, down from the previous ~200. I will adjust \u03bc\u0302 using the last 7 periods (P34-P40) to capture this most recent average (~170 units/week). Pipeline management remains critical: 1052 units (P1, P3, P4, P29) are 'zombie stock' (lost), and Period 34 (643 units) is now 6 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. This brings total 'zombie' pipeline to 1695 units. To force the OR backend to order despite this fake pipeline, I use 'explicit' mode for \u03bc\u0302, setting it to (1+L) * Forecast + Zombie Stock = (1+2)*170 + 1695 = 2205. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost pipeline. Lead times are highly volatile (1-3 periods), so I maintain L at the default 2 periods but rely on the inflated mu_hat to maintain safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Order from Period 34 (643 units) is 6 periods overdue and likely lost, increasing total 'zombie stock' to 1695 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34). Recent demand (P39-P40) suggests a slight softening to ~127 units/week compared to the P31-P38 average of ~206.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1295.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. The demand regime has softened from the high-volume recovery phase (~200 units/week) to a more moderate level. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand averaged 120.7 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 776 units following the arrival of the P39 order (885 units). However, the 'zombie stock' issue persists: a total of 1695 units from P1, P3, P4, P29, and P34 are significantly overdue and likely lost. These units remain in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory', which suppresses new automated orders. To account for this, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to ensure the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation still results in necessary safety stock, or at least covers the current demand. Given current on-hand (776) vs. recent demand (~120), we have ~6.4 weeks of cover. This is sufficient for the immediate term as we approach the end of the 47-period simulation. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average of 121 units/week across the lead-time window, but I will adjust L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (ranging 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3764.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand analysis: Demand spiked to 227 in Period 42 (late November), likely influenced by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for this denim product. The recent 4-period average (P39-P42) is 147.25 units, while the broader late-2019 recovery regime (P34-P42) averages 188 units. Pipeline reconciliation: Total In-transit is 1791 units. Confirmed 'zombie stock' (likely lost) includes P1 (415), P3 (143), P4 (213), P29 (281), and P34 (643), totaling 1695 lost units. Valid in-transit is only P38 (96 units). Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods recently. Parameter strategy: To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1791 units as available and stopping orders, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value calculated as: (1 + L) * Forecast + Zombie Stock. With L=2 and a forecast based on the holiday season avg (~185), mu_hat = (3 * 185) + 1695 = 2250. This ensures the backend maintains enough pressure to cover the lost pipeline while providing safety stock for the high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed zombie stock (likely lost) remains 1695 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34). Demand remains robust through November (Avg ~188 since late Sept), with a late-November peak of 227.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (2019/12/09), the product 'Embrace S.Skinny' pants is experiencing high demand volatility. After a late-November peak (227 units), demand dropped significantly to 30 units last period. However, we are entering the mid-December holiday shopping period, and historical data from early 2019 suggests demand can quickly rebound to 200-300 units. Total 'zombie' lost pipeline inventory is now confirmed at 2338 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, and P34), which prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. On-hand inventory is 519 units. To offset the zombie stock in the backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat explicitly. I will use an average demand forecast of 150 units/period (reflecting recent average softened by the latest dip but acknowledging seasonal potential). For (L+1) = 3 periods, this is 450 units. To clear the 2338 zombie units, the target mu_hat must be ~2800 units. Sigma_hat is set high to ensure a robust safety buffer against lead time volatility (recent arrivals varied between 1 and 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Zombie stock (likely lost) increased to 2338 units as the Period 34 order (643 units) is now 10 periods overdue with no arrival. December demand is showing high volatility, dropping to 30 units after a 227-unit peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '687704001' (Embrace S.Skinny jeans) is in a volatile late-year demand phase. After a late November peak of 227 units, demand has sharply dropped to 30 and 54 units in the last two periods, suggesting a post-peak lull or seasonal stabilization. However, the critical issue remains the massive 'zombie stock' in the pipeline. Total In-transit is 2775 units, but history shows that orders from P1, P3, P4, P29, and now P34 (totaling 2338 units) are highly likely lost as they are many periods past the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, the P34 order (643 units) is now 11 periods overdue. This zombie stock prevents the OR backend from ordering because it perceives the pipeline as overstocked. To maintain availability for potentially higher year-end or early January demand, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these lost units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 2650 to account for a 3-period demand forecast (~150/week * 3 = 450) plus the 2338 lost units, ensuring the system places a net order despite the 2775 in-transit value. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile actual lead times (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed zombie stock (likely lost) remains 2338 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34). Demand has cooled significantly in December, averaging 42 units over the last two periods compared to the November peak of 227.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans has significantly cooled in December, with the last 3 periods averaging 47.7 units (30, 54, 59), compared to the November peak of 227. This aligns with post-Black Friday/early December seasonality. Total 'zombie stock' (orders likely lost but still in the system's pipeline inventory) has reached a critical level of 2338 units (P1: 415, P3: 143, P4: 213, P29: 281, P34: 643, P38: 96, P41: 0, P44: 547 - wait, recalibrating zombie stock based on context). Confirmed lost orders are P1, P3, P4, P29, and P34, totaling 1695 units. P38 (96) and P44 (883) are still within plausible window but P38 is 8 periods overdue. Total estimated zombie stock is 1791 units (P1, P3, P4, P29, P34, P38). With 507 units on-hand and 1791 zombie units in pipeline, the OR engine will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set to override this. Given current on-hand covers ~10 weeks of current demand (~50/week), no new order is needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect current demand and sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Zombie stock (likely lost) increased to 1791 units with the addition of the Period 38 order (96 units) which is now 8 periods overdue. December demand remains in a low regime, averaging ~48 units/week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Demand for 'Embrace S.Skinny' jeans in Period 46 was 60 units, confirming a low December regime averaging ~51 units/week over the last 4 periods (P43-P46), down from the November peak of 227 and earlier averages of ~190. In-transit inventory is currently 2,674 units. However, this includes significant 'zombie stock'\u2014orders from P1 (415), P3 (143), P4 (213), P29 (281), P34 (643), and now P38 (96) are long overdue and confirmed lost. Total confirmed zombie stock is 1,791 units. Deducting this from the 2,674 'total in-transit' leaves 883 units (from P44) actually in the pipeline, which is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods. On-hand inventory is 447 units. Combined with the valid pipeline of 883, the total 'live' inventory is 1,330 units. At the current demand rate of ~51 units/week, this provides over 26 weeks of coverage. Therefore, No new orders are needed. The OR parameters are set to stay well below current inventory levels to allow for depletion during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Zombie stock (likely lost) increased to 1,791 units with the addition of the Period 38 order (96 units) which is now 8 periods overdue. December demand remains in a low regime, averaging ~51 units/week.
