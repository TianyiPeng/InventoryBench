  "rationale": "Product 678942001 is a 'Harrison short sleeve top CN' (Women's Knitwear/Short-sleeved jumper). The calendar date is February 11, 2019. Historically, demand has been declining from a peak in early January (346 units) to a stable floor in early February (172-176 units). As we move further into February, demand for this specific 'fine-knit viscose blend' item appears to be stabilizing or slightly slowing before spring transitions. Given a promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now (P1) will arrive during P3 resolution and be available for P4. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (the pipeline) plus a safety buffer for P4. Expected demand is ~175 units/period. Total demand to cover through P4 arrival is ~700 units (175 * 4). On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0. I will order 700 units to establish the pipeline and meet current demand trends.",

Since 700 units arrive this period, they will cover P3 demand (~300) leaving 400. Adding the P4 arrival of 300 brings us to 700 units for P4/P5.

(c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. The order from P1 (700 units) should arrive during P3 resolution and be visible at the start of P4 conclude. However, P3 conclude shows 0 arrivals.

Demand historical seeding (Jan) also showed values between 170-340, confirming a downward spring normalization. c) Lead time: We've seen arrivals with L=2 (P2 order) and L=1 (P5 order). The P1 order of 700 is definitely lost (6 periods elapsed). The pipeline consists of P3 (200) and P4 (250). Since P5 (300) arrived in P6 (L=1), it's possible P3/P4 are delayed or lost, though we must assume some supply is coming. d) Inventory: On-hand is 181.

Current OH (181) + expected pipeline (450) is 631. Since OH alone covers next period, and the pipeline is significantly larger than current demand rates, ordering more would risk high holding costs ($1/unit).

  "rationale": "The product is a Harrison short-sleeve top, which is highly seasonal. We are now in early November (P39), and demand has clearly entered a late-season decline, dropping from ~180 units in September to under 80 units in October, with the most recent demand being 41. Historical patterns and the product type suggest demand will likely continue to taper off or remain low as winter approaches. Regarding lead times and inventory: 400 total units arrived in P36 (ordered P33 & P35), but the 250 units ordered in P34 (now 5 periods ago) are confirmed lost, adding to the cumulative list of failures (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P29, P34). The current on-hand inventory is 261 units. Given the recent demand regime of ~40-80 units/period, this on-hand stock covers at least 3-5 periods of demand. With 150 units ordered in P36 still in transit (3 periods elapsed), the expected pipeline is sufficient. Ordering more now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs as the season ends. I will place a zero order to draw down existing stock.",

This confirms the seasonal downturn expected for short-sleeved knitwear in late autumn. Regarding inventory, the on-hand stock is 378 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~40 units/period, provides approximately 9-10 weeks of coverage. The pipeline contains significant 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (3100 units confirmed lost from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24, P29, and P34). The last valid order from P36 (150 units) arrived in P39. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low end-of-season demand and the proximity to the end of the game (Period 47), no further orders are required to satisfy demand through the remaining periods.

At a recent average demand of ~35-40 units per period (excluding the P42 spike), 272 units provides roughly 7 periods of coverage. Given there are only 5 periods left in the game (P43-P47), the current stock is already sufficient to satisfy all remaining demand.

Recent demand (Periods 40-43) has averaged approximately 31.5 units per period (17, 21, 68, 20). Even accounting for the slight volatility in Period 42, the current on-hand inventory of 252 units is far more than enough to cover the expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (estimated at 120-150 units total).
