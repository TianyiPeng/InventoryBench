Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Harrison short sleeve top'. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a clear downward trend (346 down to 172), suggesting the end of a seasonal peak or a post-holiday correction. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Given the steady decline in demand, I will use the most recent 3 samples (Jan 21, Jan 28, Feb 4) to estimate current demand (avg: 181.3). Using L=2, mu_hat should reflect demand over (L+1)=3 periods. My forecast for weekly demand is ~175, so mu_hat is set to 175 * 3 = 525. For sigma_hat, the variation in recent weeks is relatively low, but I will use recent_N (N=3) to allow the OR engine to calculate volatility from the latest trend.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's short-sleeved knit jumper. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a clear downward trend (346 -> 235 -> 196 -> 176 -> 172), likely indicating the end of a post-holiday or winter peak. However, in Period 1 (2019/2/11), demand spiked to 203, which is 18% higher than the previous week, possibly due to early spring interest. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 197 units in-transit (ordered P1, promised L=2, expected arrival P3). We lost all 203 sales in Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory. With L=2, my base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Given the recent demand volatility (172 to 203), I will use the mean of the most recent samples to stabilize the forecast while acknowledging the slight uptick. I'll set L to default (2) as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's short-sleeved jumper. Historical demand shows a declining trend from Jan (peaks of 346) into Feb (stabilizing around 172-203), but Period 2 saw a sudden spike to 311. Since the promised lead time is 2, the order from Period 1 (197 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 409 in-transit (197 from P1 + 212 from P2). The inventory position is critical as we have missed sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory. Given the volatile recent demand (203, 311) compared to the late Feb baseline (~172), I will use recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this upward movement while acknowledging the small sample size. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N to reflect this increased volatility. Lead time L is kept at default (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeve top, typically seeing increased demand as spring approaches (March). Current demand history (samples + game periods) shows mean demand around 220 units/period, but we have had zero on-hand inventory for 3 periods, resulting in 100% lost sales. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders from Period 1 (197 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4's conclude message. Since we are at the start of Period 4, those units are theoretically arriving during this resolution phase. However, since we've reached 3 periods with 'arrived=0', we are still within the promised window for P1's order to appear in the metadata next period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (including samples) for demand to capture the most relevant recent levels. We need to maintain a high base stock to recover from the stockout once arrivals begin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeve knitwear top. Current date is March 11, entering spring. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~225. Since the game started (Feb 11), demand has been: 203, 311, 235, 150. The jump to 311 in Period 2 (Feb 18) aligns with late winter/early spring transitions. Period 4 demand dropped to 150, but stockouts in Periods 1-3 (sold=0) mean we have no data on actual demand versus potential demand during that time. Regarding lead times: the P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2, as promised). The P1 order (197 units) is now 2 periods overdue (P1+L=P3, currently P5 start), which suggests it might be lost. The P3 order (362 units) is due to arrive this period (P3+L=P5). On-hand is low (62). To stabilize, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the most recent context (N=4), and stick with the promised L=2 for lead time calculations, as P2 arrived correctly. The OR backend will balance the high holding cost (equal to profit) by aiming for a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'short-sleeved jumper in a fine-knit viscose blend', which is a transitional spring piece. We are currently in Period 6 (March 18). Historical demand shows a peak in mid-February (311 units) followed by a steady decline (235, 150, 122). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 613 units in transit. Specifically, the order from Period 1 (197 units) is significantly overdue (promised lead time 2, now at Period 6), suggesting it is lost. The arrival in Period 4 (ordered Period 2) confirmed a lead time of 2. The Period 3 order (362 units) is expected to arrive this period (Period 6). Given the declining trend and the spring season, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand levels (avg ~169/week) rather than the earlier spikes. Sigma is kept at default to handle volatility. L is set to default as the last successful arrival adhered to the promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (197 units) likely lost - overdue by 3 periods beyond promised lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 678942001 is a short-sleeve top, transitioning into spring. Looking at the history, the order from Period 1 (197 units) is definitely lost (now 6 periods since ordering, promised $L=2$). The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 ($L=2$), the Period 3 order (362 units) is still in transit (ordered P3, expected P5, now P7 - flagging as potentially lost or significantly delayed), and the Period 5 order arrived in Period 6 ($L=1$). Our on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized somewhat: recent samples are 150, 122, 147 (mean ~140), down from the initial peak of 200-300. Because we have zero on-hand and 197 units are lost plus 362 are overdue, the 'In-transit' figure of 559 is likely composed of ghost units that will never arrive. To force the OR backend to order, I must set the lead time $L$ to reflect the actual observed risk ($L=2$) and use an explicit $\mu$ that ignores the ghost pipeline. I will set $\mu$ for $(1+L)=3$ periods based on the recent average demand of 140, but adjusted slightly higher to recover from the stockout.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), we are managing a 'Harrison short sleeve top'. Historical demand shows a significant decline from the initial peaks (346 down to ~150). The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 144. Inventory management is complicated by supply chain issues: the Period 1 order (197 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed vs 2 promised). The Period 3 order (362 units) is now 5 periods since ordering (3 periods overdue) and should also be considered likely lost. Current in-transit includes P3 (362), P5 (already arrived/concluded), P7 (67), and P1 (197 lost). Excluding lost orders (P1, P3), the effective pipeline is only 67 units. Since on-hand is 0, we are currently stocking out. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (N=4, avg ~144) to avoid over-ordering higher costs, and use L=3 to account for the observed volatility in delivery reliability, even though the backend cap formula will try to mitigate large orders. mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 4 * 144 = 576.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 order (362 units) now 3 periods overdue; considered lost along with Period 1 order. Actual pipeline inventory is significantly lower than 'In-transit' displays. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~144-150 units/period) compared to Jan/Feb peaks.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product is a women's short-sleeve knit top. Demand has shifted from a daily average of ~250 in January/February to a lower regime of ~150-180 in March/April. However, recent demand (P7: 158, P8: 181) shows a slight upward trend as spring progresses. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from P1 (197 units) and P3 (362 units) are significantly overdue (7 and 5 periods respectively) and must be treated as lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 559 units is entirely composed of these lost shipments, meaning actual pipeline inventory is 0. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 'phantom' in-transit stock, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a high base stock. Given L=2 (promised), a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (approx 170/period) plus a safety buffer is needed. I will target a base stock of 650 units (approx 170 * 3 + safety) to ensure the backend places an order near the cap, as the backend thinks we already have 559 units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption: Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (total 559 units) are confirmed lost. Demand shows a minor seasonal uptick in April (Avg 170) compared to March (Avg 145).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we face a critical stockout (On-hand: 0). History shows a severe supply issue: Orders from Period 1 (197) and Period 3 (362) are effectively lost (559 units total). While the system reports 'In-transit: 650', the effective pipeline is only 91 units (from Period 9). The product is a Harrison short-sleeve top; demand in March averaged ~145, but April shows a slight increase (Period 7: 158, Period 8: 181, Period 9: 80 - though Period 9 demand might be clipped by lack of stock visibility, though here demand is reported independently). April average to date is ~130. Given the lost shipments, lead time is volatile: promised is 2, but observed arrivals were at 2 and 1 periods. I will use L=2 to be safe. To recover from the lost stock and address the persistent stockouts, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covering the April/Late March regime) and increase sigma_hat explicitly to provide a higher safety buffer against the erratic supply arrivals.

The SKU 'Harrison short sleeve top CN' (short-sleeved knitwear) is entering late April. Looking at history, demand has dropped significantly over the last two weeks (80 and 75 units) compared to the March/early April average (~150). This suggests a possible end-of-season decline for this knitwear item or a specific dip. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 559 units is comprised entirely of orders from Period 1 (197) and Period 3 (362), which are now clearly lost based on carry-over insights and historical arrival patterns (recent orders have arrived with L=1). Current on-hand is low (16). Since the OR backend uses in-transit units to offset orders, and those 559 units will never arrive, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory. I'll use explicit mu_hat based on the recent 2-period demand average (~78 units) across (L+1)=3 periods, but I'll add the 559 lost units to the base stock calculation to 'bypass' the OR engine's pipeline deduction. Calculation: Forecast (78 * 3) + Lost Units (559) = 793. I will set L to 1 to reflect the actual recent lead time observed in Periods 6, 8, and 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Significant drop in demand observed in late April (avg ~77.5 units/period) compared to earlier April (avg ~170).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/29. The product is a short-sleeved knit top. We are currently in a low-demand regime: the last three periods recorded demands of 80, 75, and 54 (avg ~70). This confirms the shift noted in Period 11. Distribution reliability remains a major concern. The 'In-transit' total of 777 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from Period 1 (197) and Period 3 (362), totaling 559 units. The actual active pipeline consists of the P11 order (218 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived in 1, P7 arrived in 1, P5 arrived in 1, while P2 took 2). I will set L to 1 based on recent performance to ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment, but use a cautious mu_hat to avoid over-ordering given the current demand slump. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the drop to ~70 units/period (3 * 70 = 210), which aligns with the actual pipeline order already placed (218), likely resulting in a small or zero order this period to prevent excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand has dropped significantly to an average of ~70 units/period (Periods 9-11).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing the 'Harrison short sleeve top'. The history shows a significant downward demand trend: from an initial high of 200-300 units/period in Feb/March to a stabilized lower regime of approximately 60-70 units/period over the last 3-4 weeks. Current demand (Period 12) was 68. Pipeline inventory displays 777 units, but Carry-over Insights confirm 559 units (from P1 and P3) are lost. The remaining active pipeline consists of the P11 order (218 units). This P11 order was promised for P13 arrival but has not concluded yet (it should arrive during this period and be visible at the start of P14). Since on-hand is 0 and demand is ~70, we are currently experiencing stockouts. However, the 218 units in transit (expected to arrive this period) will cover more than 3 periods of the current demand regime (218 / 70 \u2248 3.1). To avoid over-ordering given the significant drop in demand and high holding costs relative to profit (1:1), I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P9-P12) to capture the current ~70 unit/period regime. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P7, P9) showed 1-period L, though P2 showed 2-period L.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved jumper. We are entering mid-May. Historical demand shows a significant decline from the initial February/March levels, stabilizing around a much lower regime in late April and early May (average of ~55 units over the last 3 periods: 54, 68, 42). Currently, on-hand inventory is 176 units, which covers over 3 periods of the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 559 reflects the lost orders from Periods 1 and 3 (totaling 559) which the OR backend still considers part of the pipeline. Since the backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline', and our current on-hand (176) already exceeds the required base stock for a (L+1=3) period window at the current demand rate (~55 * 3 = 165), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period regime to reflect the current low demand and prevent the backend from over-ordering while ignoring the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level for May: avg ~55 units/period (Periods 11-13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678942001' (short sleeve knit top) is currently in a lower demand regime as we move through May. Recent demand (Periods 11-14) has averaged approximately 68.75 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 65 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 559 is misleading, as 559 units (Periods 1 and 3) are confirmed lost per previous insights. The system's actual pipeline is zero, as the last order from Period 11 arrived in Period 13. Given lead time L=2, we must cover 3 periods of demand (review + lead time). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures the current lower demand regime (approx 69 units/period * 3 = 207 units). Since current on-hand is 65 and pipeline is 0, the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the target base stock. I will use 'explicit' for L to ensure the backend uses the promised lead time of 2, despite recent variability, and 'recent_N' for mu and sigma to align with the current May demand pattern.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'short-sleeved jumper', which typically sees a seasonal demand spike as late spring transitions into summer. Period 15 showed a significant demand surge to 272 units (up from a May average of ~55-70), likely signaling the start of this summer seasonal peak. While on-hand inventory is 0, the 'In-transit' figure of 559 is entirely composed of lost orders from Period 1 (197 units) and Period 3 (362 units). These orders are over 10 periods old and will not arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, it will not place any orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed 559. To force the system to order and meet the new demand regime of ~270 units/period, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1=3) at the new demand level (3 * 270 = 810) plus a buffer for volatility, then adding 559 to 'offset' the phantom in-transit units. This results in a mu_hat of ~1400. This is a corrective measure to bypass the backend's miscalculation of pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal surge confirmed: Demand spiked to 272 units in late May (Period 15). Demand regime has shifted from ~60 to 250+ units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Harrison short-sleeved jumper, showing a significant seasonal demand surge as we enter June. Demand in the last two periods spiked to 272 and 246 (avg 259), confirming a major shift from the previous low-demand regime (~55). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' of 1169 units includes 559 units from Periods 1 and 3 that have been confirmed lost according to carry-over insights. The actual reliable pipeline is 610 units (ordered Period 16). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 16 order is expected in Period 18. I will set mu_hat to reflect the New Summer demand regime using explicit calculation: (1+L) * avg(recent demand). With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 259 = 777. Since actual pipeline (610) < base_stock (derived from mu_hat), the OR engine will trigger a supplementary order. This strategy ensures we capture the high June demand while accounting for past stockouts and lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal surge firmly established: Periods 15-16 average demand is 259 units, a 370% increase from the May plateau of 55.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Harrison short sleeve top CN' (short-sleeved knitwear) is experiencing a sharp summer seasonal surge. Demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has averaged 254 units (272, 246, 244), significantly higher than the May average of ~60. Currently, on-hand inventory is 366. The 'In-transit' figure of 559 is entirely composed of lost orders from Period 1 (197) and Period 3 (362), which means the actual pipeline inventory is 0. To protect against the stockout risk during this surge, I must ensure the OR backend ignores the phantom 'In-transit' stock and targets the new demand regime. I will use 'explicit' for L=2 to match the promised lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime. This will force a replenishment order to cover the next (L+1)=3 periods of high demand while accounting for current on-hand stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product (Harrison short sleeve top) is in high demand due to a summer seasonal surge that began in late May. Demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) has been 272, 246, 244, and 202, averaging 241 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 164 units, which is less than one week's average demand in this summer regime. The 'In-transit' figure of 559 units only reflects the lost orders from Period 1 and Period 3; there is currently zero actual pipeline inventory. To maintain a sufficient service level for the (L+1) = 3 period window, I will set mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=4) and L using the recent average lead time which has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. Since profit and holding cost are equal, the base stock will target the median of the demand distribution.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June) remains high but shows signs of slight cooling from initial May peaks: avg 241 units/period (P15-P18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. We are in the summer demand regime for this short-sleeve knit top. Historical demand for the last four weeks (P16-P19) has been 246, 244, 202, and 130, showing a steady decline from the initial seasonal peak in May. The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 205 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure of 559 reflects the lost orders from Periods 1 and 3 (197 + 362), which means the actual functional pipeline is zero as no orders were placed between Period 17 and 19. On-hand inventory is low (34 units). To bridge the gap and satisfy demand over the (L+1) horizon (current plus 2 periods lead time), I will set L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to 615 (3 periods * 205 average). Sigma_hat is set to a value reflecting the recent volatility as demand cools down. The OR backend will order to reach this base stock, automatically ignoring the 'ghost' in-transit units because the capped policy logic is sensitive to the parameters provided.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in late June: Demand dropped from ~245/period (P16-P17) to 130 (P19). Recent 4-period average is 205 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 1, 2019, the high summer demand observed in late May and early June (peaking at 272 units) is clearly tapering off. The recent 4-period demand (P17-P20) is 244, 202, 130, and 120, showing a significant downward trend as we move past the early summer peak. The average demand for the last two periods is 125 units, compared to the ~240 average of the preceding four. Pipeline inventory is currently 581 units, but this includes 559 units confirmed lost in Periods 1 and 3 (197 + 362). The true actionable pipeline is only the 22 units ordered in Period 20. On-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 and observed lead times often being 1, the system needs to cover at least (L+1) periods of demand. Given the cooling trend, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture the recent stabilization around 120-130 units, while sigma_hat is set to reflect the current moderate volatility during this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: July demand cooling confirmed: Periods 19-20 average demand is 125 units, a ~50% reduction from the late May/early June peak average of 250+.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-08 (July). The product is a short-sleeved jumper, which experienced a significant summer peak in late May/early June (P15-P17) with demand averaging ~254 units. As signaled in recent carry-over insights, July demand has cooled. The average demand for the last three periods (P19-P21) is 137 units (130, 120, 163). This confirms a new lower-demand regime for July. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 581 units is misleading because it still includes the 559 units lost from orders placed in Period 1 and Period 3 (confirmed lost in P9). Adjusting for these losses, the actual pipeline inventory is only 22 units (ordered in Period 20, expected to arrive this period or next). Given the current demand level (~137/period) and a lead time of roughly 1.5 periods (calculated), a (L+1) horizon covers ~3 periods. Base stock calculation: Targetting ~411 units (3 * 137). Subtracting the real pipeline of 22 units, the system needs to order significantly. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average and L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual supply speed.

Carry-over insight: Actual pipeline inventory corrected: Total In-transit (581) includes 559 lost units from P1/P3; true pipeline is 22 units. July demand regime confirmed at ~135-140 units/period (3-period avg: 137.7).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678942001' (Womens short sleeve top) is in mid-July. Demand has been volatile: after a late May/June peak (avg ~250), it dropped to ~125 in late June but surged again to 221 in Period 22. The 4-period moving average (P19-P22) is 158.5 units. Given the recent spike to 221, I will setting the mu_hat forecast slightly higher than the July average to avoid stockouts during this volatile period. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure is 559, but these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 and 3 (197 + 362 = 559). Thus, true pipeline inventory is 0. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will use 'calculate' to average these recent arrivals. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time + current period despite the 'fake' in-transit units, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I estimate demand at 165 units per period. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*165 = 495. However, the backend subtracts pipeline (559) from its target. To force an order when true pipeline is 0, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the ghost inventory. Target units = 495 (demand) + 559 (offset) = 1054.

Carry-over insight: July demand volatility confirmed: dropped to ~125 then spiked to 221 in P22. Summer demand remains unpredictable but significantly higher than May lows.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'short-sleeved jumper', currently in mid-July (Period 24, 2019/7/22). Summer demand remains volatile but elevated. The recent July demand (Periods 21-23) shows values of 163, 221, and 171, averaging approximately 185 units/period. This is a noticeable increase from the early July average (~135-140) but lower than the late May peak (~250). Current In-transit is listed as 986 units, but this includes 559 lost units (P1, P3). Subtracting these, the true pipeline is 427 units (ordered P23). On-hand is 0. With a promised lead time of 2, the order from P23 is expected in P25. To maintain service levels given high volatility and 0 on-hand, I am setting mu_hat to cover the remaining summer demand. I will use the last 3 periods to capture the current July regime (Avg ~185). Setting L to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Significant July demand volatility confirmed: Periods 21-23 average 185 units, rebounding from the early July slump (125-130 range).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (Women's Knitwear) is currently in late July. Demand has shown significant volatility throughout July: P21 (163), P22 (221), P23 (171), and P24 (83). The average of the last 4 periods (P21-P24) is 159.5 units. The Period 24 demand drop (83) might signal the beginning of the late-summer cooling as we approach August, similar to the cooling seen after the late-May/early-June surge. Pipeline inventory management remains critical: current In-transit is 986, but 559 units (P1, P3) are confirmed lost. The active pipeline consists of P23 (427 units), which is expected to arrive during P25 (given L=2). Since 'In-transit' includes both lost and active orders, and the OR backend uses 'In-transit' as pipeline_inventory, using 'explicit' parameters is necessary to correct for the 559 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. I am setting mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (159.5 * (1+2) = 478.5) and sigma_hat conservatively reflecting the high July volatility.

Carry-over insight: July demand volatility confirmed: weekly demand varied between 83 and 221 (P21-P24), with a 4-period mean of 159.5. Pipeline correction persists: 559 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/05. The product is a short-sleeved knit top. Historically, demand peaked in late May/early June (avg ~250) and has since entered a volatile July period with an average demand of approximately 146 units/period (P22-P25: 221, 171, 83, 109). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 986 is misleading due to 559 units confirmed lost from Periods 1 and 3. The true pipeline consists of 427 units ordered in Period 23. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P23 order is expected to arrive during Period 25 or 26. Since it did not arrive in the Period 25 conclude message, it is expected to arrive during the current Period 26 (becoming visible at P27). To account for the lost stock and the volatile August demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (avg 146). I am keeping L at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P20 order at P22) have adhered to the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Pipeline correction confirmed - of 986 'In-transit' units, 559 (P1, P3) are lost; active pipeline is 427 units from P23. August entry demand (P24-P25) shows cooling compared to July peak, averaging 96 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-149.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 27 (mid-August). The current on-hand inventory is 288 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 559 units consists entirely of orders from Period 1 and Period 3, which have been confirmed lost according to historical insights. Therefore, the active pipeline is essentially 0. Demand for the seasonal 'short sleeve top' is cooling as summer progresses: the average demand over the last three periods (P24-P26) is 110.3 units (83, 109, 139), down from the late July volatility. Lead times have shown variability, with the most recent order (P23) arriving in 3 periods instead of the promised 2. I am setting L=3 to account for this observed delay and using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current cooling demand regime while maintaining a buffer for late-summer volatility. The base stock will target covering 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed for August: 3-period average (P24-P26) is 110.3 units compared to July's high volatility. Lead time for the most recent shipment (P23) was 3 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical data for this 'Harrison short sleeve top' shows high volatility during the summer months. Demand recently spiked again to 234 units (P27) after a period of cooling (P24-P26 average ~110). This indicates that early-to-mid August remains a high-demand period for this seasonal SKU. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' figure of 559 is entirely composed of lost orders from periods 1 and 3, meaning the true pipeline is zero. The OR backend needs to be directed to place a substantial order to replenish stock, as current on-hand (54) is insufficient for the next (L+1) periods. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the recent drift toward longer lead times (P23 took 3 periods). For demand forecasting, I will use a mu_hat based on the recent 4 periods (P24-P27) which averages 141.25 units per period. This balances the recent slump with the most recent spike, providing a conservative but responsive forecast for the end of summer.

Carry-over insight: True pipeline is zero; 'In-transit' 559 is confirmed lost (P1, P3). Late August demand remains volatile with a significant spike to 234 in P27 after a three-week lull (~110 avg).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the on-hand inventory is 0 and the 'In-transit' balance of 559 units consists entirely of lost orders from Periods 1 and 3. Effectively, current inventory is zero. Recent demand (P26-P28) has shown a significant late-summer resurgence with values of 139, 234, and 175. This is much higher than the early August lull (~100 units). The most recent completed shipment (P23) took 3 periods to arrive, exceeding the promised lead time of 2. Given the stockout and the high demand volatility in late August, I will set L to 2 (recent shipments have varied between 1-3). I will use a conservative recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to focus on the current late-August surge (avg ~183) and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen across late July and August. This will prompt the OR engine to place a substantial order to replenish stock and cover expected demand over the next 3 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Late August demand surge confirmed: avg 182.7 units (P26-P28) compared to the early August lull (~110). True pipeline remains zero.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the product enters the autumn season. Historical demand in August (P26-P29) averaged 172 units/period, showing significant volatility with a spike of 234 and a recent dip to 140. On-hand inventory is 0 and the 559 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (from P1 and P3), meaning the true pipeline is empty. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P23 order took 3 periods). Given the empty inventory, I need to restock to cover the current volatile demand. I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering from the cap formula but use a recent demand window to capture the late-summer/early-autumn transition. I'll use the average of the last 4 periods (P26-P29) for mu_hat [ (139+234+175+140)/4 = 172 ] and apply this to the (1+L) formula via the backend. This balances the need to replenish against the risk of high holding costs if demand cools in September.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for this fine-knit short-sleeved jumper has shown significant volatility throughout the summer, but remains seasonally relevant for the transition into autumn. Over the last five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 175.8 units, showing a sustained higher level than the early August lull. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the 'In-transit' figure of 559 remains composed entirely of lost shipments from P1 and P3, meaning the true pipeline is 0. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent shipment (P23) arriving in P26 (L=3). I will set L to 3 to account for this recent delay and use recent_N (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the late-summer/early-autumn demand level of ~175 units per period. This ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand, addressing the stockout recorded in P28-P30.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (transition to autumn) remains strong: 5-period average (P26-P30) is 175.8 units, continuing the late August surge. True pipeline remains zero and on-hand is exhausted.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the product is in a high-demand early autumn regime. The recent 5-period average (P27-P31) is 187 units. Current stock is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 704 includes 559 units from P1 and P3 confirmed lost, and 145 units ordered in P31. Thus, the active pipeline is only 145 units. With the promised lead time of 2 and actual lead times recently varying between 1 and 3, I am using a conservative lead time estimate of 2. For demand, the recent 5-period average (N=5) captures the current volatility and strength (187 units/period). Setting parameters to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the next (L+1) periods (approx 561 units) while accounting for the single active shipment of 145 units.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime remains strong and volatile: 5-period average (P27-P31) is 187 units/period. True pipeline check: Only 145 units are active; 559 units remain lost from P1/P3.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019), we are in the early autumn season. Analysis of the recent September demand (P30-P32: 191, 195, 147) shows a sustained high-demand regime with a 3-period average of 177.7 units. The 5-period average (P28-P32) is also high at 169.6. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this current autumn strength. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Regarding lead times, the most recent shipment (ordered P31) arrived in Period 32 (LT=1), but the previous one (ordered P23) took 3 periods. Given the volatility and the 2nd-period promised lead time, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average historical lead time (which is currently ~1.8). Also, 559 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost from P1 and P3, so the true pipeline is zero. The OR backend will see 559 in-transit and 0 on-hand; by setting parameters based on the current regime, we aim to trigger an order that fills the gap between the true state and the required base stock.

Carry-over insight: True pipeline is zero; 559 units shown in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3). Late September demand regime remains high, averaging 177.7 units over P30-P32.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30), we are in a strong early autumn demand regime. Recent demand (P30-P33) has been 191, 195, 147, and 224, averaging 189 units. The on-hand inventory is zero and the 'In-transit' count of 559 reflects the long-confirmed lost orders from P1/P3, meaning the true active pipeline is zero. The item is a 'short-sleeved jumper in a soft, fine-knit viscose blend,' which is highly relevant for autumnal layering, explaining the sustained high demand. I am setting L to 2 (the promised lead time) as recent arrivals (P32 arriving from P31) show lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, making the promised value a safe mid-range anchor. I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that started in late August and has continued through September. This will trigger a significant order to replenish stock and cover expected demand over the lead-time window.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Autumn transition) remains strong and volatile: 4-period average (P30-P33) is 189.25 units. True pipeline remains zero.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. The SKU is a lightweight knitwear item suitable for autumn transitions. Historically, demand has been strong throughout September (averaging ~189 units over P30-P33), but P34 showed a significant cooling to 100 units. This may indicate a transition toward winter or a late-season slowdown. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 568 units consists of 559 lost units (P1, P3) and 9 active units from P34. Therefore, the true pipeline is only 9 units. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though the most recent arrival (P32) took 1 period. I will use a conservative lead time estimate of 2 periods. For demand, the recent 5-period average (P30-P34) is 171.4 units. Since demand appears to be cooling (P34 = 100), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high September baseline while allowing the recent lower datum to pull the mean down slightly. This will signal the OR engine to place a large order to cover the current stockout and the true pipeline deficit.

Carry-over insight: October entry demand cooling: Period 34 demand dropped to 100 units compared to the September average of ~190 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status (Period 36, 2019/10/14) shows the seasonal transition from high-demand Autumn (September avg ~190) to lower-demand October. Period 34 and 35 demands were 100 and 99 respectively, confirming a significant cooling from the September peaks. The 559 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost from Periods 1 and 3. The true active pipeline is only the 9 units ordered in Period 34. Given the short-sleeved jumper's seasonal nature (Womens Knitwear), we are entering a lower demand regime. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P33-P35) given the regime shift. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P32) showed 1 period, but historical variance is present.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift confirmed: demand has deceased to ~100 units/period (P34-P35) from the September average of ~190.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has shifted into a lower October regime, averaging approx. 85-90 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P34-P36: 100, 99, 70), down significantly from the September average of ~190. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 568 is deceptive: 559 units (from P1 and P3) were confirmed lost months ago, leaving an active pipeline of only 9 units (ordered in P34). Lead times recently have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with P31 arriving in 1 period and P34 still outstanding at P37. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current lower October demand regime (mean ~90), resulting in (1+2)*90 = 270. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering during the seasonal cooling while acknowledging the depleted on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed: Average demand dropped to 89.7 units/period (P34-P36) from the September high (~190).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678942001' is entering late October, a period where demand for short-sleeved jumpers typically continues to cool heading into winter. Historical demand for the last four periods (P34-P37) has averaged 87.0 units per period (100, 99, 70, 79), confirming a significant shift from the September average of ~190. Regarding inventory, 'In-transit' shows 568 units, but earlier insights confirm 559 units (from P1 and P3) are permanently lost. The Period 34 order of 9 units is the only active pipeline shipment; it is now 3 periods since ordering and has not arrived, despite a promised lead time of 2. On-hand is currently 0. Given the low demand regime and the need to clear any residual stock before winter, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (L+1 = 3 * 87 = 261) and allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate order size. I will use L=calculate to account for the variability in actual lead times (recently ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: October demand regime firmly established: average demand is 87.0 units/period (P34-P37), a 54% decrease from the September peak (~190). True pipeline consists only of the P34 order (9 units); all other units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/4. We are entering November, and the demand for this short-sleeve knit top has cooled significantly from the September peak (~190 units/period) to an October average of approximately 78 units/period (P34-P38: 100, 99, 70, 79, 41). The most recent demand (P38) was 41 units, suggesting a continuing downward trend as colder weather sets in. Inventory is at 0. Regarding 'In-transit' units (568): 559 units from P1 and P3 are long-confirmed lost. The remaining 9 units are from P34 (ordered 5 periods ago); given the promised lead time is 2, this shipment is likely lost or significantly delayed. To ensure replenishment for the current low-demand regime while cleaning up the pipeline accounting in the OR backend, I will set L to 2 (promised). I use an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 78) projection: (1+L)*78 = 234. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility in the lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: November demand transition: October average stabilized at 77.8 units/period (P34-P38), a significant drop from the September high of ~190. Period 34 order (9 units) is now 3 periods overdue and potentially lost, joining orders from P1 and P3.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand for this knitwear item has significantly cooled, entering a late autumn/pre-winter low. The October-November average (P34-P39) is 70.3 units/period, with the last two weeks dropping to 41 and 33 units respectively. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, and 'In-transit' shows 568 units. However, 559 of these (from P1 and P3) are long-confirmed lost. The remaining 9 units from P34 are now 6 periods overdue and must also be considered lost. Therefore, true pipeline inventory is 0. I will target a lower demand regime reflecting the recent cooling (~50 units/period) while acknowledging the product is a staple knitwear item that may see a minor winter stabilizer. Lead time is set to 2 to lean on the backend's promised LT, as recent arrivals have been erratic.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: P34 order (9 units) confirmed lost (6 periods overdue). True pipeline inventory is zero. Demand regime has dropped from ~190 (Sept) to ~35-40 in early Nov.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (2019/11/18). Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward shift in Autumn: September averaged ~189 units/period, October dropped to ~78 units/period, and Early November (Periods 39-40) has collapsed further to 33 and 17 units respectively. This is consistent with a seasonal decline for a short-sleeved viscose-blend knit top as temperatures drop. The total 'In-transit' of 568 units is entirely comprised of lost units (P1: 197, P3: 362, P34: 9). Thus, true pipeline inventory is 0 and on-hand is 0. Based on the most recent two weeks, the demand regime is now extremely low. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture this rapid decline (P38-P40 avg: 30.3 units) and use explicit settings to ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order against phantom pipeline inventory. Promised lead time is 2, and recent actual lead times vary between 1-3. I will stick to L=2 as a conservative middle ground.

Carry-over insight: Significant late November demand collapse confirmed: demand dropped from ~78 (Oct) to ~25 average in early Nov (P39-P40). Total of 568 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P34).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678942001' (short-sleeved jumper) is experiencing its seasonal decline as winter approaches. Current demand for November (P39-P41) has dropped significantly to an average of 23.7 units/period, down from the October average of ~78 and the September peak of ~190. The 568 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P34), meaning the true pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this late-November low-demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture current volatility. L remains at the default promised 2 periods as there is no active pipeline to monitor.

Carry-over insight: Late November demand regime (P39-P41) has reached a seasonal low, averaging 23.7 units/period, a ~70% drop from the October average.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678942001' (Womens Knitwear) is entering December. Historically, demand for this item saw a significant collapse in November, averaging 23.7 units (P39-P41). However, Period 42 showed a sudden spike to 68 units, likely indicating a pre-holiday or early-December rebound. The 'In-transit' quantity of 568 units is entirely comprised of lost orders (P1: 197, P3: 362, P34: 9), so the true pipeline inventory is zero and on-hand inventory is zero. Given the proximity to the end of the year (Period 43 of 47) and the recent spike, I will set mu_hat based on the late November/early December window to capture the potential seasonal uptick while acknowledging the overall lower regime compared to Autumn. I will use recent_N (N=4) to average the last 4 periods (33, 17, 21, 68) which yields 34.75 per period, providing a safer buffer for the December demand than the previous 3-period low. Lead time remains at the default promised 2 periods as recent arrivals (P31, P32) fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: December demand rebound: Period 42 showed a spike to 68 units after a 3-week low average of 23.7, suggesting seasonal volatility for the holiday month.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are deep in the December holiday season for the Harrison short-sleeved jumper. Demand has been extremely low and volatile recently: 68 units in P42 followed by 20 units in P43. While December can see holiday spikes, the garment is a short-sleeved fine-knit, which typically sees lower demand in winter compared to its May-September peak (avg ~180-200). The current 'In-transit' of 568 units is entirely comprised of lost orders (P1, P3, and P34), meaning the true pipeline is zero and the on-hand inventory is zero. Given we are at Period 44 of 47 and the promised lead time is 2 periods, an order placed now would likely arrive in Period 46, leaving only one or two periods of sales left. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (averaging ~35 units over P40-P43) while allowing for some slight holiday variance. Sigma_hat is set to capture recent volatility (20 to 68). Lead time L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed delivery times (~1.8 average).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678942001 (short sleeve knit top) is in a significant late-year demand decline. Recent demand for December (P43-P44) has averaged 17.5 units, continuing the low-volume trend seen in November (excluding a single P42 spike of 68). The current date is December 16th, and with only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46) relative to a 47-period total, and a promised lead time of 2 periods, any order placed now (P45) would arrive in P47 at the earliest. Since the game ends at the conclusion of P47, and arriving inventory is only visible at the start of the following period, ordering now carries a high risk of incurring holding costs for units that cannot be sold within the active window. Furthermore, 568 units are perpetually 'In-transit' but confirmed lost (P1, P3, P34), meaning the true pipeline is zero. Given the low current demand (~18/period) and the end-of-game proximity, I am setting parameters to maintain a very low base stock to avoid terminal inventory waste.

Carry-over insight: December demand remains at a seasonal low, averaging 17.5 units/period (P43-P44). True pipeline inventory remains zero as 568 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46, Dec 23rd). Demand has reached its seasonal trough, with the last three periods (P43-P45) averaging just 18.3 units/period. The product (a woman's knitwear top) appears to follow a strong seasonal cycle, showing peaked demand in summer and early autumn, then a sharp decline into winter. Given the current date (Dec 23rd) and game history, there is no expected demand spike for this item in the immediate post-holiday period. There is zero on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' quantity of 568 is confirmed lost (orders from P1, P3, and P34). However, with the game ending at Period 47, placing a new order now (with a 2-period lead time) is futile as it would arrive after the final demand resolution. To avoid unnecessary holding costs on the final balance sheet and because the order would not arrive in time to satisfy any further demand, I am setting the forecast variables to reflect the current low-demand regime and accepting zero inventory for the final period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. This SKU is a 'short-sleeved jumper in a soft, fine-knit viscose blend', which is typically an autumn/spring transitional piece rather than a peak winter item. Historically, we saw a massive demand drop starting in October (Avg ~78), plummeting further in November (Avg ~24), and remains very low in December (avg ~23 over P42-P46). There is 0 true on-hand inventory and 0 true pipeline inventory, as the 568 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1: 197, P3: 362, P34: 9). Given that the current regime (P39-P46) reflects a seasonal trough with very low average demand (~28 units/period) and high profit vs holding cost symmetry (1.0 vs 1.0, targeting a 50% service level), I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods to capture this stabilized low-demand desert. Sigma will be calculated over the same period to reflect current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year seasonal low confirmed: December demand (P42-P46) has stabilized at a low average of 30.4 units/period. True pipeline remains zero; 568 units in 'In-transit' are considered permanently lost.
