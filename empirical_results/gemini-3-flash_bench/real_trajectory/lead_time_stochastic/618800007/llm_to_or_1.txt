Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Leona' v-neck satin vest top. Demand samples from January to early February (pre-Valentine's) show a mean of 64.4 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 13.1. Historically: Jan 7 (84), Jan 14 (68), Jan 21 (51), Jan 28 (53), Feb 4 (68). As this is a seasonal item entering the warm weather and spring fashion cycle (Womens Everyday Collection), I anticipate demand will either stabilize or slightly increase from the winter lows. Since there is no on-hand or in-transit inventory, a stock-up is required immediately. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all 5 historical samples to establish a baseline. Promised lead time (L) is 2, so the backend will look at (L+1)=3 periods of demand to set the base stock level. The service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 0.5, implying the OR engine will seek a base stock close to the median of the total demand distribution over the lead time window.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we ordered 87 units which are currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is 0 because the order has not arrived yet (leads are at least 1-2 periods). Demand in P1 was 60, but sales were 0 due to stockout. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 84, 68, 51, 53, 68 (mean ~64.8, std ~12.5). The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a spring/summer retail item. As we move further into February, demand is likely to remain stable or slightly increase as part of the 'Womens Everyday Collection' spring transition. The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order is expected to arrive in P3 (visible in P4 start). We need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 = 3 periods). Using recent_N=5 captures the slightly higher volatility and recent mean better than the long-term history which is very short.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25). Product is a 'V-neck satin top', a spring/summer fashion item. Historical demand (Jan-Early Feb) averaged 64.8 units. However, recent demand (P1: 60, P2: 121) shows a significant spike in Period 2. This suggests a seasonal transition or promotion as we approach March. On-hand is currently 0 with 161 units in transit (87 ordered P1, 74 ordered P2). The promised lead time is 2. Following the timing rules, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P4 start message. No shipments are confirmed lost yet. Due to the demand jump from 60 to 121 (avg 90.5 across P1-P2), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this upward trajectory while maintaining 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. Lead time 'L' remains default (2) as no evidence suggests a shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which is likely entering its peak season (spring/summer). We have observed 3 full periods of history with a significant demand increase compared to the seed samples (seed mean ~68, but last three periods demand: 60, 121, 110). Average demand over the last 3 periods is 97. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders from Period 1 (87 units) have not arrived yet. Based on the rules, L=2 means an order placed in P1 arrives during P3 (resolution phase) and is visible at the start of P4. Since P3 conclude (visible now) shows arrived=0, the shipment is either delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3. Currently, on-hand is 0 and we have 272 units in-transit (87+74+111). I will set L to 3 to account for the observation lag/delay. For demand forecast (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent spike (97 * (1+3) = 388). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility (std dev of 60, 121, 110 is ~32.5, scaled to 65 for L=3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (March 11). The product is a women's satin vest top, which is entering a spring/summer seasonal rise. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 64.4. However, observed demand in the game periods (P1-P4) has jumped significantly: 60, 121, 110, 115, averaging 101.5. This indicates a clear demand regime shift. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2. The first arrival occurred in P4 (ordered P2), confirming a lead time of 2. The order from P1 (87 units) has not arrived yet despite being past the promised lead time; it is either late or lost. The P3 order (111 units) is expected to arrive in P5 (visible P6), and the P4 order (116 units) in P6 (visible P7). Inventory is currently zero, so we are losing potential sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at default (2) as the P2 order arrived on time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from Period 2 onwards: average demand increased from ~65 to ~115 (+77%) coinciding with spring seasonality for women's tops. Shipment from Period 1 (87 units) is overdue/missing.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which fits the spring/summer 'Womens Everyday Collection' profile. Demand shifted significantly starting in Period 2 (average ~112 units/period compared to the initial ~65 units), likely due to the season. Regarding logistics: The order from Period 1 (87 units) is now 5 periods old with no arrival confirmation, while the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The lack of arrival in Period 5 (where the P3 order was expected) is concerning but not yet conclusive of a permanent lead-time shift; however, the Period 1 order is definitely lost. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 314 units (Orders from P3, P4, and potentially P5). I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 2-5) and maintain the promised lead time L=2 for the OR engine, while acknowledging the stockout risk due to the lost P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed loss of Period 1 shipment (87 units). P2 arrived on time (L=2). P3 order (111 units) is currently one period overdue as of Period 6 start (expected in P5 conclude).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/3/25). Demand for this 'V-neck satin top' remains in a high-demand regime, likely due to spring seasonality, with the last 5 periods (P2-P6) averaging 111.6 units (range: 101-121). Demand for P1 was lower (60), so I will use N=5 for demand forecasting to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. Regarding supply: Period 1's order (87) is confirmed lost. Period 2's order arrived on time (L=2). Period 3's order (111) is now two periods overdue (promised L=2, arrived=0 in P5 and P6 concludes), which signals a potential increase in actual lead time or a second lost shipment. Because of these disruptions, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost significant sales. To compensate for the pipeline uncertainty and the persistent high demand, I am using L=3 (explicit) to account for delays and mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (recent_N=5). This increases the base stock to cover a longer protection interval (L+1=4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability: Period 3 order (111 units) is 2 periods overdue as of Period 7 start (L=4 if it arrives next), suggesting erratic supply or further losses.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (women's v-neck satin top) is entering peak spring demand. Analysis of the last 6 periods (P2-P7) shows a stable demand regime averaging 112.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0 due to 100% stockouts in the last three periods. Supply chain health is critical: Period 1 (87 units) is confirmed lost. Period 3 (111 units) is now 3 periods overdue (L=5 if it arrives next), while Period 4 (116 units) is 2 periods overdue. Only Period 2 arrived on time (L=2). To address this, I am setting L to 4 to reflect the current supply delay, as the OR engine needs to protect against these longer lead times. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the current regime (~112.5 per week), resulting in (1+4)*112.5 = 562.5. sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for the risk of stockouts while demand is high. The OR engine will subtract the 447 units in-transit from the calculated base stock, which will trigger an order to cover the gap created by the likely lost shipments (P1 and potentially P3).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain critical: P3 shipment (111 units) is 3 periods overdue; P4 shipment (116 units) is 2 periods overdue. Effective lead time for planning increased to 4+ to buffer against unreliable arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a 'V-neck satin top', which is a spring/summer seasonal item. Historical demand from Period 2 to Period 7 averaged ~112 units. However, Period 8 saw a massive demand spike to 228 units, likely driven by the start of warmer weather in April or a specific promotional event for the 'Womens Everyday Collection'. Regarding supply: the Period 1 shipment (87 units) is definitely lost. The Period 3 (111 units) and Period 4 (116 units) shipments are significantly overdue (6 and 5 periods respectively) and should be treated as lost to prevent under-ordering. Surprisingly, the Period 6 and 7 orders arrived in Period 8 (22 units and 111 units), showing lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively. This indicates that while old shipments are lost, new shipments are moving. I will set L to 4 to provide a buffer against the demonstrated supply instability. For demand, I'll use explicit forecasting to account for the current spring surge (averaging recent demand and the P8 spike), setting mu_hat for the (L+1)=5 period horizon at 750 units (150 units/period) and sigma_hat at 110 to cover the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Demand spiked to 228 (+100% vs previous average), confirming high spring seasonality. Shipments from Period 3 (111 units) and Period 4 (116 units) are now confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the demand for this 'V-neck satin top' is in a high-seasonality phase. While Period 8 saw a massive spike (228), Period 9 returned to 103, suggesting high volatility rather than a sustained 200+ mean. Analysis of arrivals shows that while shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost, shipments from P6 and P7 arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 respectively. This indicates the logistics channel is active but unreliable. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With 661 units in transit (including the large P9 order of 231), the inventory position is high relative to the mean demand. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of erratic delivery seen in early periods. For demand, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture the high-seasonality regime (Avg ~165 per period) while acknowledging the high variance (sigma_hat explicit). The backend OR will use these to calculate a base stock covering (3+1) periods, but the cap (pipeline vs base stock) will likely prevent over-ordering given the 661 units already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Supply volatility confirmed; while recent orders (P6, P7) arrived, earlier losses (P1, P3, P4) necessitate a higher planning Lead Time (L=3) to buffer against stockouts despite high pipeline inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the V-neck satin top is in the peak spring/early summer season. Demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting around Period 8, where demand spiked to 228, but has since stabilized to an average of ~113.5 over the last two periods (P9: 103, P10: 124). For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 3 to capture this post-spike stabilization while acknowledging the higher spring demand baseline compared to February. Regarding supply, the system recently cleared a backlog with arrivals in Period 8 and Period 10, confirming that recent orders (P6, P7, P8, P9) are arriving with lead times of 1-2 periods. However, three older shipments (P1, P3, P4) remain lost. On-hand inventory is healthy at 223 units, so a standard Lead Time (L=2) is appropriate now that the supply chain has stabilized for recent batches. I am using sigma_hat recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen during the Period 8 spike.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilization: Orders from P8 and P9 arrived successfully in P10 (L=2 and L=1 respectively), suggesting the previous period of heavy losses (P1, P3, P4) has subsided for now.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU (V-neck satin top) is in the middle of its peak spring/summer season. Demand since Period 8 has averaged 144.75 units (228, 103, 124, 124), representing a stabilization at a higher regime than early spring. Supply chain performance has normalized with the last four arrivals (P7, P8, P9 arriving with L=1 or L=2), indicating the period of heavy losses (P1, P3, P4) has passed. We currently have 99 units on-hand and 315 in-transit (orders from P10 and P11). Given the current demand average (~145/week) and a total pipeline inventory of 414 units, we have enough coverage for approximately 2.8 periods. I will revert L to the promised lead time of 2 as the supply chain has stabilized. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~145 * (1+L) = 435). This ensures we maintain high service levels during the seasonal peak while accounting for the significant stock already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~145 units/period starting Period 8 (+25% vs previous active regime). Supply chain returned to promised lead time (L=1-2) over the last 4 concluded arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a women's satin vest top, which is seeing peak seasonal demand. Recent demand (P8-P12) has established a new mean around 144 units per week, following a significant spike in P8 (228 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 336 units in transit (a combination of orders from P10 and P12). The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1-2 periods for the most recent successful arrivals (P8-P10 arrivals). I will set the Planning Lead Time (L) to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure we cover demand during the promised lead time plus the review period, as recent performance suggests reliability has returned. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P8-P12) to capture the current high-demand regime necessitated by early summer seasonality, which averages 143.6 units per period. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this peak period (e.g., the 228 spike in P8).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are in a high-demand phase for 'V-neck satin top', although the last observed demand (Period 13) dropped to 74 units from a recent average of ~132 units (Periods 9-12). This dip may be transient or a sign of cooling spring seasonality. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 431 units in-transit (orders from P10-P13). Looking at lead times: recent arrivals in P8 and P10 showed actual lead times of 1-2 periods, which matches the promised lead time of 2. However, the order from P10 (1 unit) and P12 (21 units) have not yet concluded, creating a stockout in P13. I am setting L=2 (promised/recent) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the regime from P9-P13) to capture the current mean demand of ~113 units per period. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. The large pipeline (431 units) against an expected base stock (approx 340) will likely result in a capped order, which is appropriate given the current 100% stockout risk and uncertain demand trajectory at the end of spring.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 112.8, a decrease from the peak period P8 (228), suggesting the seasonal peak has passed.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the SKU 618800007 (V-neck satin vest top) is experiencing a post-peak seasonal decline in demand. The recent demand regime (P9-P14) has averaged 115.8 units, down from the P8 peak of 228 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, but there is significant pipeline inventory (410 units), including a 95-unit order from P13 expected to arrive this period (L=2). Lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods. Given the high pipeline and softening demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the current post-peak average (~116 units/period). I will set L to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P10, P12, P14) show lead times of 1-2 periods, aligning with the backend's expected behavior. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the current volatility of this declining phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800007 (V-neck satin top) is currently in a post-peak seasonal phase. Period 15 showed a demand of 117, confirming a softening from the April peak (sample max 228) but remaining higher than the initial base baseline of 60. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 117.0, which aligns with the carry-over insight of softening demand. The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) but has a massive pipeline (410 units) from large orders placed in Period 13 and Period 10 earlier (though P10 P11 etc are closed, the current In-transit shows 410). Let's trace the pipeline: P13 ordered 95. In-transit of 410 suggests orders from P13 (95), P10 (some residual), or other recent un-concluded periods are outstanding. Specifically, orders from P14 (0) and P15 (0) were empty. The 410 units are likely the P13 order (95) plus potentially older un-exhausted orders. Given the high pipeline relative to current demand (~117), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current 117 average. For lead time, the last four arrivals (P8, P10, P14) showed L values of 1, 2, 2, 1, and 2. Thus, the promised L=2 is stable. I use 'explicit' L=2 to ensure the OR engine recognizes our expected arrival timeline despite past losses.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/03), the SKU (women's satin top) is experiencing a period of zero on-hand inventory and consistent stockouts. The demand has stabilized around a mean of ~115 units per period over the last 8 periods (since P9), reflecting a high-summer demand plateau. The supply chain has shown recent stability with lead times of 1-2 periods, but a significant gap exists in visible arrivals: orders from P13 (95 units) are now 2 periods overdue as of P16 conclude, and no arrivals occurred in P15 or P16. Despite having 410 units in-transit (P10: 1, P12: 21, P13: 95, and others), the system is currently starved of stock. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival delays and use explicit mu_hat reflecting (1+L)*115 to ensure the OR backend generates an order sufficient to cover the gap between current pipeline and the projected demand for the next 4 periods (review + lead time), while maintaining a high safety stock through sigma_hat to mitigate the risk of further lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Supply chain instability recurring. P13 order (95 units) is 2 periods overdue as of P16 conclude. On-hand inventory has been zero for 4 consecutive periods (P13-P16) despite significant pipeline. Seasonal demand stabilized at ~115 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant instability. The order from Period 13 (95 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered 2019/5/06, promised L=2, now P17 conclude shows no arrival), suggesting it is likely lost. On-hand inventory has been 0 for 5 consecutive periods (P13-P17) because of these delays and losses. Current demand has stabilized at a lower level than the April peak; the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 104 units. To compensate for the unreliable supply and the likely loss of the P13 shipment, I am setting L to 3 to increase the base stock level and buffer against further delays. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L)*105 to reflect the current stabilized demand regime, while sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx sqrt(1+L)*40) to maintain a high service level given the zero on-hand status and high pipeline risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Confirmed loss of Period 13 shipment (95 units) after being 4+ periods overdue. Stockout persistency: 5 consecutive periods with 0 on-hand inventory due to supply disruptions. Current demand regime stabilized at ~105 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), the SKU continues to experience a prolonged stockout (6 consecutive periods with 0 on-hand inventory) due to supply disruptions and lost shipments (notably Period 13). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime as spring seasonality fades; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is ~93 units, compared to the peak of 228 in P8. There is a massive pipeline of 460 units (comprising orders from P10, P11 omitted as 0, P12 arrived, P13 lost, and significant orders from P17 and other periods). Specifically, the OR engine sees a 'pipeline' that includes undelivered units from P14-P18 which may be lost. However, since P17 (50 units) and others are still within a plausible delivery window if lead times are currently erratic, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to buffer against these delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the softened demand regime (~93 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current demand volatility. This strategy aims to prevent further over-ordering into an already saturated pipeline while acknowledging the supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed softening at Period 18: Avg demand stabilized at ~93 units/period (P14-P18), down from peak spring levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800007 (V-neck satin top) is experiencing a period of severe stockouts due to high supply chain instability and lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P13 are all officially confirmed lost). We have been out of stock for 7 consecutive periods (P13-P19), despite having a massive pipeline (460 units in transit). The demand has softened from its Spring peak (228 units in P8) to a more stable summer regime of approximately 88 units per period (average P15-P19). Given that we have 460 units in transit (likely representing orders from P17 and other recent attempts) and a target base stock for (L+1) periods would only be around 270-300 units, the OR engine will likely not place new orders because pipeline inventory (460) exceeds the base stock level. I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time) as recent successful arrivals (P10-P14) showed stability before the P13 loss, and mu_hat will use the recent 6 periods (P14-P19) to reflect the softened demand regime of ~94 units/period across the (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: Stockout persistency extended to 7 consecutive periods (P13-P19). Demand regime confirmed softening: Period 14-19 average is 100.8 units, compared to the early spring peak of 115+ units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800007 (V-neck satin top) is entering July, following a spring peak and a current period of severe supply disruption. On-hand inventory has been 0 for 8 consecutive periods (P13-P20). Several orders (P1, P3, P4, P13) are confirmed lost. Currently, there is 460 units in-transit (orders from P17 and potentially others not yet concluded). High-level demand has softened from the April peak of ~145 to a more stable summer regime. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P14-P20) is 100.4 units. Given the persistent stockouts and unreliable supply chain history, I will maintain a slightly elevated planning lead time (L=3) to increase the base stock level via the safety stock calculation, helping to buffer against further losses or delays. For demand, I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current stable summer trend (avg ~100), avoiding the skewed April spike.

Carry-over insight: Stockout persistency extended to 8 consecutive periods (P13-P20). Demand regime for summer stabilized at ~100 units/period (average P14-P20 is 100.4), significantly lower than the April peak but consistent.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 618800007 is heavily disrupted, with a stockout persistency of 8 consecutive periods (P13-P20) and confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13). Although the pipeline shows 460 units (likely including orders from P17 and potential system-tracked legacy units), on-hand inventory remains 0. Demand has stabilized into a summer regime with an average of approximately 100 units per week (average P14-P21 = 97.5). The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals are erratic. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this stabilized summer demand (~100/week) and use an explicit lead time of 3 to buffer against the ongoing supply unreliability, even though the pipeline is technically large, to trigger restorative ordering if the backend logic allows for depletion of long-overdue units from the active pipeline calculation.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800007 (V-neck satin top) has experienced a prolonged stockout since Period 12, with the exception of a small arrival in Period 14. This is due to a series of lost or significantly delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P13 are confirmed or highly likely lost). The current on-hand inventory is 0, while pipeline inventory is 460 units. These 460 units consist of orders from P17 (50 units) and undisclosed stock likely from very early periods that never arrived; however, since P17 was ordered 6 periods ago, it is also likely lost or severely delayed. Demand has significantly cooled from the spring peak of ~115-145 units to a summer average of ~70-80 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). Given the extreme unreliability of the supply chain (high loss rate) and the current massive (though likely phantom) pipeline of 460 units, the OR backend will not place new orders if L is set to its promised value. To trigger a recovery order despite the phantom pipeline, I will set an explicit Lead Time (L) of 4 to reflect the historical volatility and a mu_hat based on the recent softened demand (approx 75 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of (1+4)*75=375. Since the backend subtracts pipeline (460) from base_stock, and 460 > 375, a standard calculation would result in 0 orders. However, to ensure we eventually overcome these losses, I am maintaining the higher lead time estimate and will monitor if the backend's 'cap' allows for replacement of lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: July demand (P21-P22) dropped to an average of 58.5 units, indicating a move towards late-summer/pre-autumn clearance or lower seasonal interest. Supply chain remains broken with no arrivals for 8 consecutive periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 618800007 remains severely disrupted with no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (since Period 14). The In-transit pipeline of 460 units includes orders from Period 17 (50 units) and earlier periods that are likely lost or permanently delayed. On-hand inventory has been zero for 11 consecutive periods. Demand has shown a clear downward trend in July (P21-P23), dropping from ~100 to ~31 units/period, consistent with the end of the peak summer season for a lace-trim satin vest top. Given the massive pipeline (460 units) relative to current demand (~31-40 units), and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) which prioritizes lean inventory (q=0.5), no new orders are justifiable. Setting mu_hat to a recent window (N=3) reflects the significantly lower late-summer demand regime (avg ~49). sigma_hat is set via recent_N to capture current volatility. L is set to explicit 2 to reflect the promised lead time during this 'wait-and-see' phase, although actual reliability is zero.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed in July: average demand dropped to ~49 units (P21-P23) from ~100 units in June. Supply chain remains non-functional with total stockout since P14 and zero arrivals for 10 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 618800007 remains severely compromised, with zero arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (since Period 14) and no inventory on hand for over 10 periods. Currently, 460 units are 'in-transit', which includes the Period 13 order (95 units) confirmed lost and several subsequent orders (P17, etc.) that are now well beyond the promised lead time of 2. Historical demand analysis shows a clear downward trend from the April peak (~115+ units) to late-summer levels (~49 units/period avg from P21-P24). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the calculated base stock, the presence of 460 'phantom' units in-transit will likely prevent any new orders from being placed unless mu_hat is set extremely high. However, given the current demand decay to ~50 units, a massive base stock would lead to extreme holding costs if the supply chain suddenly unsticks and delivers the backlog. I will set L=recent_N (N=3) to reflect the high risk of delay, and mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower demand level of approximately 51 units per period (P21-P24). Despite the stockout, I must avoid over-ordering into a falling market.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues: July demand (P21-P24) average is 50.75 units, confirming a seasonal low. Total of 11 consecutive periods without arrivals; on-hand inventory has been zero for 12 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 618800007 remains severely disrupted with no arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (since Period 14) and 0 on-hand inventory for 13 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 460 units includes the recent order from Period 17 (50 units) and orders placed during the high-demand spring peak that were likely lost, though the backend still counts them in pipeline inventory. Demand has significantly softened from the spring peak (~115 units) to a summer low. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) is 50.0 units. Given the persistent stockout and unreliable supply, I will set L to 5 explicitly to force the base stock calculation to account for longer lead times, and use the recent 5 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current seasonal demand level. This approach aims to trigger an order if the pipeline is considered depleted, although current calculations may be hindered by the massive (likely lost) pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure extended: 12 consecutive periods without arrivals; on-hand inventory zero since Period 13. Demand regime for late summer (P21-P25) stabilized at ~50 units/period, down from ~100 in early summer.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 618800007 is currently non-functional. The last successful arrival was in Period 14. There have been 12 consecutive periods without any inventory arrivals (P15-P26), and on-hand inventory has been zero since Period 14. The pipeline inventory (460 units) consists of orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17, all of which are significantly overdue and likely lost. Specifically, P17 (ordered 50 units) is now 10 periods overdue (L=10+). For Period 27 decision, I must assume the promised lead time of 2 is invalid. I will set L to 15 (explicit) to accurately reflect the reality that current pipeline inventory is blocked/lost and the effective lead time to receive new stock is unknown but extremely high. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer low; the average for the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is 49.6 units. I will set mu_hat to 800 (approx 50 units * 16 lead+review periods) and sigma_hat explicitly to provide a safety buffer, although the OR backend's cap mechanism will likely limit order size given the massive (though lost) pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Supply chain failure duration reached 12 periods with zero arrivals. Effective planning Lead Time (L) increased to 15 to account for the total loss of confidence in the current pipeline and to force the OR backend to acknowledge the stockout despite high nominal in-transit numbers.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 618800007 remains essentially broken, with no arrivals since Period 14 (14 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The on-hand inventory has been zero since Period 14, leading to lost sales. Current 'In-transit' inventory (552 units) is extremely high relative to current demand, but these units must be considered likely lost or indefinitely delayed based on the historical pattern (P1, P3, P4, and P13 shipments were all lost). In Period 27, I initiated an 'explicit' lead time of 15 to force the OR backend to order despite the massive pipeline, effectively discounting the phantom in-transit inventory. The current date is late August (2019/8/19), where demand for a 'super-skinny shoulder strap' satin top is seasonally decreasing. Average demand from Period 21-27 is 46.7 units. I will maintain the explicit L=15 to bypass the pipeline inventory trap and set mu_hat to reflect the late-summer regime (1+15)*47 \u2248 752. This ensures the backend attempts to restore on-hand inventory if the supply channel reopens, while acknowledging the decreasing seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure duration reached 13 periods with zero arrivals. Late-summer demand regime (P21-P27) stabilized at ~47 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains significantly disrupted for SKU 618800007, now marked by 13 consecutive periods (P15-P28) without any stock arrivals and a cumulative 15-period stockout since P14. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time for recent orders (P1, P3, P4, P13) has effectively reached infinity due to lost shipments. The backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With 625 units in-transit (many of which are likely lost from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P27, P28), the OR engine will not order more unless the base_stock calculation exceeds this phantom pipeline. To force an order despite the high in-transit count, I am maintaining an explicit L=15 and an explicit mu_hat reflecting current demand (~45 units/period) multiplied by (1+15) periods. This is a strategic 'inflation' of lead time to bridge the gap caused by the missing shipments. Demand has stabilized in a late-summer low regime (P21-P28 average ~47 units), so I am setting mu_hat at 720 (45 * 16) to ensure the system attempts to restock.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Supply chain failure duration reached 14 periods with zero arrivals. Late-summer/pre-autumn demand regime stabilized at ~45 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively failed, with 15 consecutive periods of zero arrivals since Period 14. This has resulted in a continuous stockout since the middle of May. While there is a large nominal pipeline (694 units), these are likely lost or indefinitely delayed given the extreme history of non-delivery. In Period 27, I switched to an 'explicit' lead time of 15 periods to force the OR backend's logic to ignore the stale pipeline and place new orders, attempting to rebuild inventory. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer/pre-autumn level of approximately 45 units per period (Avg P21-P29 = 47.5, recent P27-P29 = 41). I will continue using an explicit lead time L=15 and update mu_hat to reflect the current regime (~45 units) for the (L+1) horizon. This ensures that even with the 'cap' logic, the system targets a total inventory position capable of recovering from the prolonged stockout once shipments resume.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain failure duration reached 15 periods with zero arrivals. Late-summer/pre-autumn demand regime (P21-P29) stabilized at ~45-47 units/period.

The supply chain has finally resumed after a massive disruption (no arrivals from Period 14 through Period 29). In Period 30, shipments from P27 and P28 arrived (L=3 and L=2 respectively), resulting in common-sense replenishment. On-hand inventory is now 135 units, which exceeds the current late-summer/pre-autumn demand regime. Historical demand for the last 10 periods (P21-P30) has stabilized at an average of 45.4 units per period. Since we just received a large influx and have 555 units still 'in-transit' (many of which are likely lost from the P13-P26 gap, though some recent orders P29-P30 are active), the OR backend's pipeline calculation will be inflated. I will set L to the promised lead time of 2 to reflect the return to normalcy, and mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand level of ~45 units. High sigma_hat is maintained to account for the residual volatility of the supply chain restart.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain resumed in Period 30 after a 16-period hiatus. Recent arrivals (P27, P28) show lead times of 2-3 periods. Late-summer demand regime (P21-P30) confirmed stable at ~45 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has finally resumed operations after a 16-period disruption. Arrivals in Period 30 (from P27 and P28 orders) confirm an actual lead time of 2-3 periods, which is close to the promised L=2. However, I will keep L at 3 for one more period to maintain a conservative safety buffer while on-hand inventory recovered to 112 units. Demand has clearly shifted into a late-summer/early-autumn low, with the Period 21-31 average stabilizing at 43.1 units. This is a significant drop from the spring levels. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=11) to capture this lower demand regime (P21 to P31), preventing the OR backend from over-ordering based on old spring peaks. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current lower volatility. With 112 units on-hand and 555 units still in-transit (many of which are likely the old lost orders from the disruption phase), the system is unlikely to place new orders, allowing the existing stock to cover the current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed in Period 30; actual lead times for recent orders are 2-3 periods. Autumn demand regime (P21 onwards) stabilized at a much lower average of ~43 units/period, compared to ~100+ during spring/summer.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has successfully recovered with the last three orders arriving with lead times of 3, 2, and 2 periods respectively. On-hand inventory is now 118 units. Demand has entered a clear autumn downturn, averaging 41 units over the last 12 periods (P21-P32) and significantly lower (average 24.3) over the last 3 periods. I am setting L=2 (the current observed stable lead time) and using recent_N for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the low autumn demand regime (~41 units/period). This results in a mu_hat covering 3 periods of demand at this lower rate. Given the high in-transit quantity (529 units, largely older orders that may still arrive or be lost) and the current on-hand position, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero or very small orders, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive 16-period disruption, with recent orders arriving consistently within 2-3 periods. Demand has entered a lower autumn regime (P21-P33), currently averaging approximately 41 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 76 units with a significant pipeline of 529 units from the aggressive orders placed during the replenishment recovery phase (P27-P30). Given the current demand pace and high in-transit levels, there is a substantial risk of overstocking as the backlog arrives. I will set the Lead Time (L) to 'calculate' to reflect the actual recent performance of 2-3 periods, and mu_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 13 periods (since Period 21) to capture the stabilized autumn demand level (~41 units/period) rather than the volatile spring/summer averages. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to reflect the lower variance observed in this new regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 2-3 periods (P27 arrived in 3, P28/P30 arrived in 2). Demand has shifted to an autumn regime, significantly lower than the spring/summer peak. Since Period 30, demand has averaged approximately 26 units per period (P30-P34: 30, 23, 20, 42, 15). There is currently 61 units on-hand and 529 units in-transit (reflecting historical large orders and the high L used during the supply failure period). With demand at ~26 units and a stabilized lead time of 2, the current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 590) is more than sufficient to cover many periods. I will set the lead time to its promised 'default' to allow the OR engine to use the standard L=2, and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current low-demand autumn regime (avg ~26) rather than the historical spring highs. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed (P30-P34): average demand dropped to ~26 units per period, a 42% decrease from the late-summer average (~45).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 2-3 periods (P27 arrived in 3, P28 in 2, P30 in 2). I am setting L=2 (the promised lead time) as the system is no longer experiencing the extreme 16-period hiatus. Demand has entered a clear autumn low: the average demand from Period 30 to 35 is approximately 22.6 units per period, a sharp decline from the late-summer levels of ~45. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. With on-hand inventory at 55 and lead time at 2, the pipeline of 529 units (mostly from older, likely lost orders or extremely delayed ones from mid-year) is massive. However, the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism and the current on-hand inventory being sufficient to cover multiple periods of this new low demand (55 / 22.6 \u2248 2.4 periods) mean that setting parameters to reflect actual current demand will naturally prevent new unnecessary ordering while we bleed off existing stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800007 (satin vest top) is experiencing a sharp seasonal decline as we move into late October. Demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) has averaged only 18.6 units, significantly lower than the ~43 units seen earlier in autumn and the ~100+ seen in spring/summer. The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 2-3 periods (P30 arrived in 2, P28 in 2, P27 in 3). On-hand inventory is 45 units, which covers more than two periods of current demand. Additionally, There is a massive pipeline of 529 units (largely from orders during the period of disruption), which creates a high risk of excess holding costs if demand continues to fall. Therefore, I am setting parameters to reflect the low demand regime (recent_N=5) and using the promised Lead Time (2) to prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders against the already bloated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter demand collapse confirmed: Period 32-36 average demand fell to ~19 units/period, a ~55% decrease from the early autumn average (~43).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800007 (V-neck satin top) is experiencing a post-summer demand collapse as the season shifts into winter. Demand has significantly decreased: the average for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is 16.4 units, and the most recent 3 periods (P35-P37) average only 8.33 units. This is a sharp decline from the blossom of spring (~115) and summer (~100). On-hand inventory is currently 36 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 4 periods. Additionally, there are 529 units in transit (mostly from P29 and previous disrupted periods), though many are likely lost or delayed indefinitely. Given the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), the OR backend's service level target is 50%. With high existing on-hand stock relative to current sales and a huge pipeline, I will set parameters to prevent further ordering. I am using a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the late autumn decline without being overly reactive to the single-digit demand of the last few weeks, while maintaining lead time at the promised 2 (as the supply chain has stabilized recently).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Winter demand collapse finalized; demand for P35-P37 averaged ~8 units, down from ~43 in early autumn. Overstock risk is high due to inventory arriving just as seasonality ends.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (618800007, V-neck satin top) is experiencing a severe winter demand collapse as expected for a sleeveless/summer garment in November. Over the last 4 periods (P35-P38), average demand has plummeted to 8.5 units per period. Concurrently, the SKU has an massive in-transit pipeline of 529 units (mostly from historical unresolved orders and recent smaller orders) and an on-hand inventory of 27 units. Even at the current low demand rate, the 27 units on-hand will last ~3 periods. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), so we must be extremely aggressive in preventing further arrivals to avoid high holding costs during the off-season. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this winter regime and use the default lead time (L=2) as the supply chain has stabilized.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed: P35-P38 average demand is 8.5 units/period, a massive decline from spring/summer levels. Avoid ordering as existing stock and pipeline far exceed foreseeable winter demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the satin vest top has hit a winter floor, with an average of approximately 10 units per period over the last five weeks (P35-P39: 6, 10, 9, 9, 15). This represents a significant seasonal drop from the spring/summer peak. Inventory levels are currently very high relative to this low demand; on-hand inventory is 12 units and in-transit is 529 units (mostly comprising old orders placed during the supply chain disruption or larger speculative orders in P27-P29). These 541 units represent over 50 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 5 samples to reflect this low-demand regime, and L is set to default as the supply chain has stabilized at the promised lead time. The objective is to stop all ordering and minimize holding costs while the existing mountain of inventory slowly clears.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is moving through its final periods (41 of 47). Current demand is in a deep winter trough, averaging ~11 units over the last 6 periods (P35-P40). On-hand inventory reached 0 in P40. However, there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 529 units (from previous large orders and disruptions) which significantly exceeds any possible demand for the remaining 7 weeks of the year. Placing any new orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales, as the pipeline already covers roughly 48 weeks of demand at the current rate. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are generated by the OR engine. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for demand parameters to reflect the low winter regime (N=6) and 'calculate' for lead time as shipments have stabilized recently.

The product is a satin vest top, which is highly seasonal (spiking in Spring/Summer). We are currently in late November (Period 42), heading into the winter floor. Demand has collapsed from a peak of ~115 to an average of ~13.5 over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). On-hand inventory is 0, but there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 529 units (orders likely placed during the supply chain disruption or over-ordered during the peak). This in-transit quantity covers nearly 40 periods of current demand levels. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will set the Lead Time back to 'default' (2) as the supply chain recently showed recovery signs (L=2-3), but primarily I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window to reflect the winter demand floor and prevent the OR engine from ordering more into an overstocked pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a satin vest top with lace trim, a highly seasonal item that peaked in spring (P8-P10) and has now collapsed into a winter floor. In Period 43 (Dec 2), we are in the middle of a seasonal low. Demand for the most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) averaged ~17 units, but the very recent spike to 31 in P42 might be a pre-holiday blip rather than a sustained regime change. Significantly, there is a massive pipeline inventory (529 units) and on-hand is 0. This pipeline is the result of orders placed during a period where lead times were extremely long/erratic; if these units arrive now, the system will face massive holding costs as current demand is roughly 1/10th of spring levels. No further orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat to an explicit low value reflecting the current winter demand (approx 15 units per period * (1+L)) and set L to default (2) to stabilize the backend. The target is to minimize further arrivals while waiting for the existing massive pipeline to clear or be canceled.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a winter demand floor (average ~13 units/period over P39-P43), which is a significant drop from its spring/summer peak. We have 0 on-hand inventory, but a massive in-transit pipeline of 529 units. These units represent orders placed during the supply chain disruption period (mostly P17, P29 etc.) that have yet to arrive or be confirmed lost. Given that the current winter demand is extremely low and the pipeline is huge, the priority is to avoid ordering any additional stock to minimize holding costs. Setting mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 (covering the winter floor) and keeping L at default (promised 2) will result in a base stock level far below the current pipeline (529 units), effectively preventing any new orders from being placed by the OR backend.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (mid-December), we are in the deepest part of the winter demand floor for this item (V-neck satin top). Historical demand for the last 10 periods (P35-P44) has averaged approximately 11.6 units per period, with recent weeks showing even lower figures (6-10 units). The Supply Chain has entered another catastrophic period of non-arrivals: zero units have arrived since Period 32, despite an 'In-transit' balance of 529 units. These units represent orders from Period 29 (69 units) and likely several other un-concluded old shipments or backend adjustments. Given that we have only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47) and on-hand inventory is 0, ordering more is futile: any new order would likely not arrive before the game ends, and even if it did, the holding costs would exceed potential profit due to the current demand floor. I will set the parameters to reflect the very low winter demand regime using the last 7 periods (P38-P44) to avoid unnecessary ordering while recognizing the effective failure of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Second supply chain failure confirmed; zero arrivals for 13 consecutive periods (P33-P45) despite 529 units in pipeline. Winter demand floor confirmed at ~10 units/period (P40-P44 avg: 15.4, but excluding P42 spike, avg is 11.5).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800007 is currently in a confirmed winter demand floor. Since Period 35, demand has averaged approximately 10.5 units per period. The supply chain has failed for a second time, with zero arrivals for 13 consecutive periods (P33-P45), leaving the on-hand inventory at zero for 6 consecutive periods. However, there are 529 units in-transit (pipeline inventory), which is more than enough to cover over 50 periods of the current winter demand levels (10.5 units/period). Ordering more units now would drastically increase holding costs without providing any additional benefit, especially as demand for this satin vest top is expected to remain low until the spring season begins in mid-February (approx. Period 53). I will maintain L at the promised 2 periods and set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the current low demand regime (~10 units/period * (1+L) = 30) while minimizing sigma_hat to prevent the OR backend from triggering a safety-stock order against the large, albeit stalled, pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls at the end of December (2019/12/30). The demand for this 'V-neck satin top' has reached its seasonal floor, with the last 5 periods (P42-P46) averaging 12 units/period, and even lower in the most recent two weeks (Avg: 6.5). The supply chain is in a state of terminal failure for this SKU, with zero arrivals for 15 consecutive periods (since P32). There are 529 units 'In-transit', which are almost certainly lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, etc.). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is minimal, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the winter floor. I will maintain L=2 (promised) as the pipeline is already saturated with ghost units that the OR backend cannot differentiate from actual incoming stock; ordering more at this stage would only increase the risk of massive holding costs if the logistics issue is suddenly resolved during a low-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Second supply chain failure duration reached 15 periods (no arrivals since P32). Winter demand floor remains stable at approx 6.5-12 units/period.
