Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Fake 1p Leggings' which is a staple fashion item. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. Historical demand from the 5 available samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows values of 83, 62, 67, 81, and 57. The average demand is 70.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 11.4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since there are no observed arrivals yet, I will use the 'default' method for lead time and the 'recent_N' method for demand (N=5) to capture the most recent statistics. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. I'll use recent_N to ensure the forecast is grounded in the most relevant recent data points.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). In Period 1, we placed an order for 89 units with a promised lead time of 2. Following the logic in 'Scenario A' of the instructions, even though Arrived=0 was reported for Period 1, this is normal behavior for a lead time \u2265 1. The order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). The item is 'Fake 1p Leggings' for women. Looking at the five pre-game demand samples (83, 62, 67, 81, 57), the mean is 70.0 and the standard deviation is 11.33. Period 1 demand was 50 (slightly lower than previous samples). Given that we have 0 current on-hand inventory and the first order won't arrive for two more cycles, we must ensure our parameters sustain the next period. Since the holiday season (Lunar New Year was Feb 5, 2019) has just passed, demand might be stabilizing or slightly lower. I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the available history (6 samples including Period 1 demand) to capture the recent trend, and default for others until lead time performance is confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is faux-leather leggings, which are seasonally relevant in early spring. The historical demand data (Jan-Feb) shows an average demand of approximately 70 units/period (83, 62, 67, 81, 57). In Periods 1 and 2, demands were 50 and 83. Currently, there is an inventory stockout (on-hand = 0), and 178 units are in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the timing rules, the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3's resolution phase and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). Thus, the zero arrivals in P1 and P2 are expected. Demand is stable; I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent variance and mean, and keep L at default (2) as no evidence yet suggests a lead time deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is 'Fake Leggings', a fashion item. We are currently experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory because the first order (Period 1) hasn't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the timing rule: Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. I will set L to 3 to account for this observed delay. Demand has been fairly stable (50, 83, 70), averaging 67.6 units/week. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand (mu_hat). To regain inventory position and cover the extended lead time, I'll use a recent_N approach for demand metrics to capture the current trend (N=3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which generally shows steady demand during winter and early spring. The confirmed lead time from Period 4's conclude message is 2 periods (ordered P2, arrived P4), which matches the promised lead time. However, the order from Period 1 (89 units) has not yet arrived or concluded; if it were following a 2-period lead time, it should have arrived in Period 3. This suggests either a variable lead time or a potentially lost shipment. Historical demand samples (83, 62, 67, 81, 57) and active period demands (50, 83, 70, 61) suggest a mean demand of approximately 68.2 units per period. With L=2, the requirement for (L+1) periods of demand is approximately 205 units. Current on-hand is 28 and in-transit is 182 (total 210), which covers current needs. However, since the P1 order might be lost, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=2) and use recent_N for demand to capture the latest behavior (N=5) while maintaining 'default' for sigma to account for the variance seen since start.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). Looking at the history, the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), but the order from Period 1 (89 units) never arrived and is now 5 periods old, indicating it is likely lost. Demand is stable, averaging ~69 units over the last 5 periods (samples: 50, 83, 70, 61, 66). Inventory is currently 0 with 182 units in transit (orders from P3 and P4). Since the Period 1 order is lost, the OR engine needs to compensate for the missing units to reach the target base stock. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture current stability, and use the default lead time of 2 as confirmed by the P2-P4 arrival.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 1 (89 units) is likely lost (no arrival after 5 periods), resulting in a stockout at Period 5.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 305931001 (Imitation Leather Leggings) is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). History shows: Period 1 order (89 units) is lost (exceeded L=2 by 4 periods). Period 2 order arrived exactly at L=2. Period 3 (25 units) and Period 4 (68 units) orders are pending. The Period 3 order is now overdue (should have arrived in Period 5 or 6). I treat the Period 1 order as lost. Historical demand (5 samples + 6 game periods) averages ~66 units/week. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 66, 51, 70) shows no significant trend change from the initial samples (83, 62, 67, 81, 57). Given the stockout and the high risk of lost or delayed shipments, I will use L=2 (promised) but maintain a reliable demand estimate. Since profit=1 and holding=1, the critical ratio q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median. Using recent_N=5 for demand captures the most recent game performance which aligns with the initial samples.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (25 units) is overdue (now 4 periods since order, promised 2); combined with the lost Period 1 order, this suggests a pattern of supply chain instability or lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU is in a critical stockout state with 0 units on-hand. A review of the order history confirms severe supply chain issues: the Period 1 order (89 units) is definitively lost, and the Period 3 order (25 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. The only successful arrival was the Period 2 order in Period 4 (lead time = 2). Current in-transit inventory (199 units) includes these likely lost units and newer orders from Periods 4, 6, and 7. Demand has stabilized at a lower level recently, averaging ~52 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7), compared to the initial samples. To recover from the stockout and account for the high probability of lost shipments, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock level (safety buffer) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand trend. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to maintain standard volatility coverage.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 order (25 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, confirming a high loss rate (2 out of 3 early shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 8 sales. Looking at history, demand has averaged around 52 units/period (last 5 periods: 66, 51, 39, 47, plus historical samples 83, 62, 67, 81, 57). Shipments from Period 1 (89 units) and Period 3 (25 units) are confirmed lost after exceeding lead time by 5+ periods. Period 6 (16 units) and Period 7 (1 unit) arrived in Period 8, showing lead times of 2 and 1 respectively. Pipeline inventory (213) includes the Period 4 order (68 units), which is now overdue (4 periods since order, L=2). Given the significant loss rate and stockouts, I need to maintain a robust base stock. However, a massive order of 68 units (Period 4) is still in-transit; if it arrives, it helps, but the backend cap and pipeline logic will automatically adjust order size. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the slight downward trend compared to January, and explicit Lead Time L=2 to reflect the promised and recently observed performance (despite the instability).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Verified lead-time variability (P6 took 2 periods, P7 took 1 period). Period 4 order (68 units) is currently 2 periods overdue but not yet declared lost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. Historical demand for these 'Fake 1p Leggings' has been relatively stable, averaging around 57 units per week over the last five weeks (P5-P9). However, a severe supply chain reliability issue exists. Orders from Period 1 (89 units), Period 3 (25 units), and now likely Period 4 (68 units, 6 weeks since order) must be treated as lost. Only 3 orders (P2, P6, P7) have arrived. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a trend of lost shipments, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current stable-but-lower demand regime (~57 units). For lead time, I will use 'explicit' value 2 because while we see losses, the surviving shipments (P2, P6) arrived in 2 periods. To compensate for the high loss rate and current stockout, I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to increase safety stock levels, effectively setting a higher base stock to buffer against the risk of future orders not arriving, while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Supply reliability is approximately 50-60%. Effective lead time for surviving orders remains 2 periods, but high inventory risk persists due to these frequent losses.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for imitation leather leggings has been on a downward trend as seasons transition from winter/early spring into late spring (falling from 50-80 units in Feb to ~30-45 units in April). The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. However, recent surviving orders (P6, P7, P8) followed the promised lead time of 1-2 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) and 182 units are technically in-transit (though some may be the lost shipments from P1/P3/P4), I need to set parameters that encourage the OR engine to order enough to cover the low inventory while being mindful of the declining demand trend. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the lower demand regime (average ~40 vs earlier 60-70) and calculate for lead time to reflect the 1-2 period history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: average demand has settled into a lower range (~40 units/week) compared to the initial sample period (~70 units/week) as the season progresses.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear downward shift: initial samples averaged ~70 units/week, but the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 36.4 units. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost, leaving 'In-transit' heavily inflated with 182 phantom units. Specifically, only P2, P6, P7, and P8 orders actually arrived. Because the OR backend defines orders as 'base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)', and the pipeline inventory includes these 182 lost units, the system will not place new orders unless we adjust parameters. To bypass this, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the reliable observed lead time for successful deliveries) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am forecasting demand at ~35 units/period. Over (L+1) = 3 periods, this is 105 units. However, to force an order despite the 182 lost units in 'pipeline', I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the policy or trust the OR cap logic. Actually, a better approach to clear the 'lost order' hurdle is acknowledging that the backend subtracts 'In-transit'. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand (35 * 3 = 105) plus a buffer for the lost units to ensure we actually procure stock for the upcoming weeks.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Fake 1p Leggings' is experiencing a significant demand decline as we move into May (Spring/Summer), which is consistent with the product being thick 'imitation leather' leggings. Recent demand (P11-P12) has averaged ~25 units/week, down from the post-April average of ~40. The current status shows on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 250 units in-transit. These in-transit units are a combination of the P12 order (68 units) and several very old orders (P1, P3, P4) that were previously flagged as likely lost but remain in the 'In-transit' accounting. If we only consider the P12 order as 'real' pipeline, we have 68 units coming against a weekly demand of ~25. However, since the OR backend uses 'Pipeline Inventory', and the game records 250 units in-transit (including lost ones), the OR engine will see a massive surplus and refuse to order. To force a correction, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the recent demand drop (22, 29, and the earlier 29). The high in-transit count (250) vs. actual expected arrivals (68) means we are unlikely to place an order this period regardless of parameters, but we must stabilize stats for when current stock arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor established: Late Spring demand for imitation leather leggings has stabilized at ~25 units/week, a 65% drop from February peaks. In-transit tally (250) is heavily inflated by lost orders from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May. The product (imitation leather leggings) has moved into a low-demand summer regime. Historical demand since Period 10 has stabilized around 25-30 units/week. My current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit figure (250) is highly misleading because it includes 182 units from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, and 4. The only valid shipment in transit is from Period 12 (68 units). With a lead time of 2 periods, the Period 12 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 14 and be visible in the Period 15 start message. Period 14 is likely a stockout until that arrival. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current low-demand regime (~28 units/week) and keep lead-time settings at 'default' since the promised 2 periods remains the most common arrival pattern for surviving orders.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand summer regime confirmed (P10-P13): mean demand is ~28 units/week. Net pipeline inventory effectively excludes lost P1, P3, P4 orders (182 total units).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the demand for 'Fake 1p Leggings' has transitioned into a low-demand summer regime. Over the last four weeks (P11-P14), demand has averaged 29.5 units per week (22, 29, 32, 35), significantly lower than the initial samples (~70) and consistent with the seasonality of imitation leather leggings. The pipeline inventory of 182 consists entirely of lost orders from Period 1 (89), Period 3 (25), and Period 4 (68), as confirmed by the carry-over insights. These orders are 11+ periods overdue and will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' to calculate orders; since it doesn't know these units are lost, it will under-order unless I adjust the parameters to force an order. However, current on-hand inventory is 33, and expected demand for the upcoming lead-time horizon (L+1=3) is approximately 90 units. To maintain service levels despite the phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent 4-week mean (~30) multiplied by (L+1), and use L=2 (confirmed lead time for successful deliveries).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the demand for 'Leggings in imitation leather' has stabilized at a low summer regime. The most recent demand samples are 22, 29, 32, 35, and 34 (average ~30 units/week), which is significantly lower than the February/March peak of ~70 units/week. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively aiming for the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit of 182 units consists entirely of lost orders from Period 1 (89), Period 3 (25), and Period 4 (68). Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is 0. To ensure the backend places an order for the next cycle (L+1 = 3 weeks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the stable low-demand summer floor. For lead time, I will stick to 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P8, P12) arrived exactly in 2 periods, while the 'in-transit' phantom orders are ignored by my parameter logic to trigger replenishment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the product 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather) is entering the high summer season, where demand for faux leather typically remains at its seasonal floor. Recent history (P11-P16) shows a stable demand regime averaging 32.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' of 182 units is entirely comprised of legacy lost orders (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68), as verified in carry-over insights and historical arrival logs. Thus, effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we aim to meet median demand over the (L+1) horizon. Given L=2, the horizon is 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stable summer demand level (~32.5 units/week), which the OR backend will scale by (1+L) to set the base stock. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 182 units in transit and likely under-order unless the lost units are accounted for; however, since I cannot manually zero out the pipeline, I will set 'L' to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (2 periods) and use 'recent_N' to ensure the target reflects current low seasonality.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/10. The product is imitation leather leggings, which are entering a seasonal low-demand period (summer) as seen in recent demand history. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 182 units is composed of lost orders from Period 1 (89), Period 3 (25), and Period 4 (68). I must treat the pipeline as effectively 0 to trigger a new order. Demand from Period 10 to 17 has averaged 28.375 units per week. I'll use a recent N (last 8 samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this summer regime. Lead time remains consistently 2 periods for orders that actually arrive, so 'default' (promised=2) is appropriate for calculation.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Period 10-17) confirms stable consumption at ~28 units/week. Net pipeline must exclude total lost units (182) to avoid permanent stockouts due to OR backend offset.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are in a low-demand summer regime for imitation leather leggings. Historical demand from Periods 10-18 (the current regime) shows a mean of approximately 26 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' figure of 182 units is entirely composed of shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (89+25+68=182), which were declared lost multiple periods ago as they are now over 15 periods overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline inventory from the target base stock to determine the order quantity, these 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing new orders, resulting in continuous stockouts. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 182 lost units. With L=2 and mean=26, the required base stock is roughly 78. Adding the 182 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 260. Setting sigma_hat to the standard deviation of the recent regime (~8) scaled by sqrt(3) suggests a value around 14 to maintain a standard service level under stabilized demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Early Summer). The product is 'imitation leather leggings', typically a winter/spring fashion item. We are currently in a low-demand regime confirmed between Periods 10-19, with an average demand of approximately 27-28 units per week. The total In-transit value of 260 includes 182 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that have been confirmed lost (it has been over 15 periods since those orders were placed). Subtracting these lost units, the effective pipeline inventory is 78 units (from Period 19), which is expected to arrive in Period 21. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (260) from the base stock, we must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target level. We need enough stock to cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at ~28 units/week, which is 84 units. To offset the 182-unit phantom pipeline that the backend will subtract, we set mu_hat to 84 + 182 = 266. L is kept at 2 as recent successful arrivals (P12, P8) followed the promised lead time. Sigma_hat is set to cover the moderate volatility observed in the summer regime (std ~10).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. The SKU is 'Leggings in imitation leather', which is typically a winter/transitional item. Demand has settled into a low summer regime (mean of ~16 units/week over the last 3 periods: 17, 18, 11). There is a significant inventory reconciliation issue: 'In-transit' shows 266 units, but history confirms that orders from P1 (89), P3 (25), and P4 (68) were lost, totaling 182 phantom units. Period 12 (68) arrived correctly. The current real pipeline consists of P19 (78) and P20 (6), totaling 84 actual units. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders. If pipeline is 266, it will never order, leading to permanent stockouts. To force an order, I must set mu_hat (the target inventory level) to exceed the phantom pipeline. Target base stock = (1+L)*mu + safety stock. With L=2, and mu~16, target is ~48. Adding the 182 lost units, I need a 'mu_hat' around 230 to 250 to resume replenishment. Since demand is currently very low, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom pipeline while maintaining a small buffer for summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor revised: late June demand dropped further to ~16 units/week. Phantom in-transit units (182) from P1, P3, P4 continue to suppress OR backend ordering; mu_hat must be inflated by ~182 to compensate.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for 'Fake 1p Leggings' has dropped to a low summer regime, averaging approximately 16 units/week over the last three periods (P19-P21). The 'In-transit' figure of 266 units is highly distorted by historical lost shipments (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68), totaling 182 units that will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from its order calculation, these 182 'phantom' units prevent any new orders from being placed. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to cover the projected demand for the review+lead window (3 periods * 16 units/week = 48) plus the 182 phantom units to neutralize the offset. This results in a mu_hat of 230. Since promised lead time is 2 periods and actual lead times (when they arrive) vary between 1 and 2, but the backend uses L for the window calculation, L=2 is maintained. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value reflecting the reduced volatility in the current low-demand summer floor.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor further verified: Period 19-21 average is ~16 units/week. Total confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4) remain 182, necessitating a baseline mu_hat inflation of +182 until these units are cleared from pipeline visibility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Leggings in imitation leather' is in a summer trough, with the most recent 4 periods (P19-P22) averaging 16 units/week. A critical operational issue persists: 182 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' tally (260 total - P19(78) - P20(6) arrived + P22(???)). Actually, In-transit is 260. The 78 units from P19 are still in transit (L=2). The 182 units are definitely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (260) from the target base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to offset these 'phantom' units. To ensure the backend targets a real-world stock level of ~16 units/week across the (L+1)=3 week horizon, I must set mu_hat to (Target Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. Calculation: (16 * 3) + 182 = 48 + 182 = 230. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the current low-demand volatility (std dev of P19-P22 is ~3.5, so sqrt(3)*3.5 is ~6).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019/07/22) is in the middle of summer, a low-demand season for imitation leather leggings. Demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has averaged approximately 14.6 units/week, drastically lower than the initial February-March peaks. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 260 units is heavily distorted by 182 units confirmed lost in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (89+25+68=182). These 182 'phantom units' never arrived but remain in the backend's pipeline inventory, preventing the OR controller from placing new orders. To fix this, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2, Forecast=16, and Lost_Units=182, the target mu_hat is 3 * 16 + 182 = 230. This forces the backend (base_stock - pipeline) calculation to recognize that we need more units to cover current demand despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set based on recent lower volatility (~5.0), adjusted for lead time: sqrt(1+2)*5 \u2248 8.66.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~15-16 units/week (July summer low). Total confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4) remain 182, which still requires manual inflation of mu_hat to overcome the OR backend's pipeline inventory offset.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019/07/29, which is the heart of the summer season for 'Fake 1p Leggings' (imitation leather), a product clearly characterized by winter/spring seasonality. Demand has continued to decline, with the last few periods (P23-P24) showing single-digit demand (9 and 7 units), significantly lower than the previous July average of ~16. The total in-transit units (260) are highly inflated by 182 phantom units from Period 1 (89), Period 3 (25), and Period 4 (68) which are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from Period 19 (78 units) is now 6 periods overdue (promised 2), signifying it is also likely lost. Total confirmed/likely lost units now equal 182 + 78 = 260. Since the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (260) from the base stock target, it will never place a new order unless we artificially inflate mu_hat. This inflation must cover the phantom 'pipeline' plus our actual forecasted demand for (L+1) periods. Using a conservative summer demand of ~10 units/period and L=2, required mu_hat is 260 + (3 * 10) = 290.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Order from Period 19 (78 units) is now 6 periods overdue and declared lost. Total lost pipeline units increased from 182 to 260, requiring a corresponding increase in mu_hat inflation to bypass the OR pipeline offset.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/05. We are in the extreme summer low for imitation leather leggings, with demand dropping to <10 units/week. Lead time remains consistently 2 periods for successful deliveries. A major issue persists with 'phantom inventory': 260 units in-transit are confirmed lost (Period 1: 89, Period 3: 25, Period 4: 68, Period 19: 78). However, the OR backend sees In-transit=290 (the 260 lost + 30 ordered last period), causing it to zero out any new orders. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Lost Units). Desired base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at current demand (~5 units/week) is 15. Total mu_hat = 15 + 260 = 275. Sigma_hat is kept low (explicit 10) to reflect stable low demand and avoid over-ordering, though mu_hat inflation is the primary driver to overcome the pipeline offset.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost units increased to 260 (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68, P19: 78). Demand hit a seasonal trough in late July/early August <10 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 27 (2019/08/12). We are in a seasonal low for imitation leather leggings (Womens Nightwear/Socks & Tights). Demand in the last 4 periods (P23-26) has averaged 9 units/week. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 290 units. Supply Chain Analysis: Based on history, 260 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68, P19: 78). These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the base_stock calculation (pipeline_inventory = 290). Only 30 units (ordered P25) are likely active. Strategy: We must use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the pipeline offset. The 'correct' base stock for a 2-period lead time at ~10 units/week demand would be ~30. To get the backend to order, we need mu_hat \u2248 Target_Base_Stock + In_Transit_Obstruction. Target base stock = (L+1)*9 = 27 units. In-transit obstruction = 290. Total mu_hat = ~317. I will set mu_hat to 320 to ensure we cover demand while accounting for the 'phantom' inventory reported in 'In-transit'. L is set to 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P22) followed the promised lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 19, 2019. The product (imitation leather leggings) is exiting its seasonal trough (late July/early August) and moving into the pre-autumn phase. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 27 units, significantly higher than the 4-16 unit range seen in the previous four weeks. This likely indicates the beginning of the autumn ramp-up as weather cools. Pipeline management remains critical: current in-transit is 280 units, but 260 of these are confirmed lost (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68, P19: 78). The OR backend calculates orders as [base_stock - pipeline], so these 260 'phantom' units will block all new ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*forecast + 260. For the forecast, I expect demand to rise toward ~35 units/week in the coming period. With L=2, the required total mu_hat = (3*35) + 260 = 365. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this compensation and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand pivot: August 12 demand (27 units) suggests the autumn ramp-up has begun for imitation leather leggings. Total confirmed lost units remain 260.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26. We are exiting the summer demand trough and shifting into the autumn ramp-up for imitation leather leggings. Recent demand (P27: 27, P28: 22) confirms a higher regime than the July average of ~10-15 units. I am forecasting a mean demand of 30 units/week for the upcoming periods as seasonality pivots. Pipeline inventory is significantly distorted by 260 confirmed lost units (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68, P19: 78). The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (362) from its base stock calculation. Since 260 of those 362 units will never arrive, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost Units = (1 + 2) * 30 + 260 = 350. This ensures the OR engine places orders despite the phantom pipeline stock. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the increased volatility of a seasonal shift.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal ramp-up confirmed: demand increased from ~10 units/week (July) to ~25 units/week in late August. Inventory distortion remains at 260 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 30 (2019/9/2). Demand history shows a seasonal ramp-up in late August/early September for these imitation leather leggings (increasing from <10 to ~20 units/week). The OR backend's 'In-transit' count is currently 362 units, but this is heavily distorted by lost shipments from P1 (89), P3 (25), P4 (68), and P19 (78), totaling 260 phantom units. These lost units act as a 'pipeline barrier' that prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders. To force the system to order, I must inflate mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime at ~25 units/week. With L=2, base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods, or 75 units. However, because the backend sees 260 units already 'in-transit', it will order zero unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed that offset. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a value that accounts for both the forecast (~75 units) and the phantom inventory (260 units), targeting a mu_hat around 335. I will set sigma_hat to reflect moderate volatility as the autumn season starts.

Carry-over insight: In-transit distortion persists at 260 units (P1, P3, P4, P19 confirmed lost). Autumn demand ramp confirmed; weekly mean shifted from ~10 to ~22 units/week (+120%).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) is currently in an autumn ramp-up phase. Recent demand at Period 30 was 39 units, significantly higher than the summer low of ~10-15 units. The autumn regime (P27-P30) shows an average demand of approximately 25-30 units/week. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 260 units is almost entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68, P19: 78). Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculating the order, these 260 'phantom' units will prevent any new orders from being placed unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them. Based on a forecasted weekly demand of 30 units and a lead time of 2, the required base stock (L+1 periods) is ~90 units plus a safety buffer. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to [Desired Base Stock + 260]. I am setting mu_hat to 365 (representing ~35 units/week for 3 periods + 260 offset) and sigma_hat explicitly to cover the increased volatility during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn ramp-up confirmed: demand increased from summer trough (<10) to 39 units in P30. Total confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) remain 260, requiring continued mu_hat inflation to bypass OR pipeline inventory offset.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September is seeing a clear autumn demand ramp-up for imitation leather leggings as temperatures drop. Demand over the last two periods (P30-P31) averaged 42.5 units, up from the summer trough of <10. I expect this upward trend to continue or at least hold steady around 40-45 units/week. Lead times fluctuate between 2 and 3 periods, so I will maintain the default estimate. The critical issue remains the 260 'phantom' units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P19) which were declared lost in the carry-over insights but remain in the backend's pipeline inventory calculation. To force the OR backend to place orders despite this 260-unit ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to (Predicted Demand * (L+1)) + 260. With a predicted weekly demand of 43 and L=2, the required mu_hat is (43 * 3) + 260 = 129 + 260 = 389. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the instability of the autumn ramp-up and provide safety stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019, which is a peak demand period for imitation leather leggings as autumn progresses. Recent demand shows a clear upward trend: P30 (39), P31 (46), P32 (51). The average of the last 3 periods is approximately 45 units/week. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 330 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost orders from Periods 1 (89), 3 (25), 4 (68), and 19 (78), totaling 260 phantom units. These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock calculation, preventing new orders. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to cover both the actual seasonal demand forecast and the 260-unit offset. For Period 33, I forecast a demand of 50 units/week. Over the (L+1) period (where L=2), the base mu_hat should be 150 (3 * 50). Adding the 260-unit compensation results in a mu_hat of 410. I am using recent_N for L to account for the actual observed lead times (typically 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: P30-P32 demand averaged 45 units/week (+180% vs. summer). Total confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) remain 260 units, necessitating mu_hat inflation.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '305931001' (imitation leather leggings) has entered its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Period 33 demand spiked to 119 units, likely driven by the transition into cooler weather (late September). The average demand over the last four periods (P30-P33) is approximately 63.75 units/week. However, the OR backend logic is still distorted by 260 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) which remain in the 'In-transit' tally (402 total), leading the backend to underestimate the required order. To counteract this, mu_hat must be inflated. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecasted Demand + Lost Units offset. With L=2, (1+2)*65 + 260 \u2248 455. This ensures the backend places an order sufficient to cover the current high demand despite the phantom inventory. I am using recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand spiked to 119 in Period 33, with a 4-period moving average of ~64 units/week. Total confirmed lost units remain 260, necessitating sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak autumn/winter season (October). Demand has surged from summer lows (<20) to a recent 4-period average of ~73.5 units (P31: 46, P32: 51, P33: 119, P34: 78). The total in-transit units (455) are significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (89), Period 3 (25), Period 4 (68), and Period 19 (78), totaling 260 'phantom' units. These 260 units must be added to the target base stock (via mu_hat inflation) because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (455) when calculating new orders. I set mu_hat using the recent 4-week demand average (~73.5) across the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods total) plus the 260-unit compensation: (3 * 73.5) + 260 = 480.5. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 40 units per week (reflective of recent volatility) scaled over the lead time: sqrt(3) * 40 \u2248 70.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak demand confirmed: Late September/Early October demands are 119 and 78. Total confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) remain 260, necessitating mu_hat inflation to bypass the OR pipeline offset.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak Autumn/Winter season for imitation leather leggings. Demand has shifted significantly upwards, with recent weekly values of 119, 78, and 84 (averaging ~93 units/week). The 'In-transit' figure is currently 411 units. However, 260 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, and P19) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (411) from the base stock calculation, so we must compensate for these 260 phantom units. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure the order covers next-period demand plus the offset. Given a current mean demand (mu) of ~90 and Lead Time (L) of 2, the base requirement is (1+L)*mu = 270. Adding the 260 unit offset requires an explicit mu_hat of 530. Sigma_hat is set to a high 'recent_N' to handle the high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Oct peak demand is ~90 units/week. Total phantom in-transit units remain 260; mu_hat must be inflated by this amount to prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to pipeline inventory bloat.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak Autumn/Winter season for imitation leather leggings (Period 37, late October). Demand remains strong with recent values of 119, 78, 84, and 57 (mean ~85). The 'In-transit' figure of 432 is heavily distorted by 260 'phantom' units from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19. If these aren't accounted for, the OR backend will subtract them from the base stock calculation, leading to an 'ordered=0' decision and subsequent stockouts. To counter this, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic from previous periods, I will estimate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand + 260. With L=2 and mean_demand ~85, the true mu_hat would be ~255. Adding 260 results in a targeted mu_hat of 515. Sigma is set based on recent volatility (std dev ~25 across 3 periods) to ensure a high service level during this peak period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, which is the peak period for imitation leather leggings as temperatures drop. Recent demand (P33-P37) shows high volatility but a strong average of approximately 85 units/week. The on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit value (474) contains 260 confirmed lost units (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68, P19: 78). To ensure the OR backend places orders, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract this phantom inventory. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~85 units/week) plus the 260 unit offset. With L=2, the total required reach is (3 * 85) + 260 = 515. Using an explicit mu_hat of 515 achieves this. I'll use explicit sigma_hat based on recent high volatility (std dev of ~30 scaled by sqrt(3)) to maintain a high service level during this peak season.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak Autumn/Winter season for imitation leather leggings (early November). Recent demand (Period 33-38) shows a high mean of approximately 88 units/week (119, 78, 84, 57, 85, 108). The in-transit inventory of 473 includes 260 'phantom' units from confirmed lost orders (P1: 89, P3: 25, P4: 68, P19: 78) which the OR backend incorrectly views as available supply. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to this pipeline bloat, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic: Target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at ~88/week is ~264 plus safety stock. With 260 lost units in pipeline, I set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the offset and maintain a steady flow of fresh inventory. Sigma is set high to reflect seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) total 260. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count indefinitely, requiring a persistent offset in mu_hat or explicit ordering to prevent stockouts caused by the OR backend's inventory balancing logic.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in the peak demand season for imitation leather leggings (Autumn/Winter). The last 4 periods show strong demand (85, 108, 70, and an average of 86). The 'In-transit' count of 405 is heavily distorted by 260 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19). The OR backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock; therefore, I must inflate mu_hat by these 260 units to prevent the system from under-ordering or skipping orders. I will use the recent_N method (N=7) for demand to capture the current high-season regime (~80 units/week) and use explicit mu_hat to perform the manual offset. The target mu_hat should be (1+L)*80 + 260. With L=2, mu_hat = (3*80)+260 = 500. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to accommodate the high volatility (70-119 range) seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 40, cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) remain 260. These units permanently bloat the 'In-transit' figure, requiring a +260 unit offset in mu_hat to maintain stock levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18, entering the peak winter season for imitation leather leggings. Demand recently spiked to 108 (P38) and remains strong (74 in P40), with a recent 4-week mean of approximately 80 units/week. Inventory is currently 0, with 451 units 'In-transit'. However, 260 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, and P19) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. This 'phantom' inventory causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it subtracts the full 451 from its target stock level. To correct this, I must inflate mu_hat by the quantity of lost units (260) to bypass the pipeline offset. For demand forecasting, I will use the recent 4-week mean (approx 80 units/week) and project for a 3-period window (L+1), resulting in a base mu_hat of 240, which then receives the +260 lost-unit offset, totaling 500.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the peak winter season for 'imitation leather leggings'. Demand remains strong, with the most recent observed demand at 93 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 86 units/week. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, so I will use a 3-period average for L. A critical issue persists: 260 units from orders in P1, P3, P4, and P19 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count. This 'phantom' inventory causes the OR backend to under-order or not order at all. To compensate, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by adding these 260 units to the expected demand for the (L+1) period window. Using a base demand of 86 units/week and L=2 (rounded), the (L+1) demand is ~258. Adding the 260 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 518. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect current high-demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) remain 260. These units permanently bloat 'In-transit' and require a +260 unit offset in mu_hat to ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we are in the peak winter season for imitation leather leggings. Demand spiked dramatically to 191 units in Period 42. The 3-period moving average (P40-P42) is now 119 units/week, indicating a high-volume regime. The supply chain has a critical distortion: 260 units from P1, P3, P4, and P19 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (518 units total in-transit). The OR backend subtracts the full 518 units from its base stock calculation. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 518' yields a positive order covering the current demand volume. With average demand at 119 and a lead time of 2, a target base stock should be roughly (2+1)*119 = 357 plus safety stock. To force the OR engine to order approximately 120-150 units, I will set mu_hat to 650. This 'excessive' mu_hat effectively offsets the 260 lost units and provides a cushion for the 191-unit demand peak while the system waits for Period 40-42 orders (total 164 units) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Extreme demand spike detected in P42 (191 units). Total confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) remain at 260, continuing to bloat 'In-transit' and requiring significant mu_hat inflation (+260 minimum) to maintain adequate ordering.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/9), we are deep in the peak winter season for imitation leather leggings. Demand recently spiked to 191 units and remained high at 128 units last period. The 4-period moving average is approximately 121 units/week. A critical inventory distortion remains: 260 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19 are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 555). This creates a 'phantom inventory' that the OR backend subtracts from its target base stock, potentially zeroing out necessary orders. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 (promised), we need to cover 3 periods. Forecasted demand is ~125/week, so target base stock is ~375. Since the OR backend sees 555 units in transit, it will order 0 unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed that pipeline. To ensure an order of ~130 units (representing one week's replacement) when pipeline is 555, the base_stock calculation must target ~685. Setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*125 + 260 = 635 handles the bulk of the offset, and a high sigma_hat ensures the safety stock push needed to overcome the remaining pipeline bias and stockout risk.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing a significant seasonal peak for imitation leather leggings. Recent demand (P42-P44) has surged to an average of 152 units/week (191, 128, 137). Total 'In-transit' is 635, but this includes 260 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock. To ensure the backend places orders despite this 260-unit phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as (1+L)*E[demand] + 260. With L=2 and E[demand] estimated at 140 for the peak, the formula is 3*140 + 260 = 680. For sigma_hat, I use an explicit value of 100 to account for high volatility seen in recent weeks (e.g., the jump to 191). Lead time remains 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P40, P41) show lead times of 2-3 periods, consistent with the historical average of 2.1.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are at the height of the winter demand peak for imitation leather leggings. Historical demand for the last four weeks (P42-P45) has been extremely high: 191, 128, 137, 137 (average ~148 units/week). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 479 is significantly inflated by 260 confirmed lost units from P1, P3, P4, and P19. Additionally, the order from P34 (53 units) is now 12 periods overdue and can be confirmed as lost, bringing total 'phantom' in-transit units to 313 (260 + 53). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order size. With a pipeline inventory visible to the backend as 479, but an actual effective pipeline of 166 (479 - 313), the backend would likely order 0 or very small amounts unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these ghost units. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Total_Lost_Units. With L=2 and Mean_Demand \u2248 140, base mu_hat is 420. Adding the 313 lost units results in 733. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the high volatility of the current peak season.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Order from Period 34 (53 units) is confirmed lost (12 periods overdue). Total cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34) now total 313 units. This 'phantom' in-transit inventory requires a +313 offset in mu_hat to ensure the OR backend continues to place orders despite the bloated pipeline count.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak winter season (Dec 30) for imitation leather leggings. Demand over the last 4 periods (P43-P46) averaged ~128 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count is 669, but this contains 313 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P34). The OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed to cover the holiday/winter peak, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these phantom units. Base stock target: ((1+L) * Mean Demand) + z*Sigma. With L=2, (1+2)*128 = 384 units required for the cycle. However, the OR backend sees 669 in transit. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to at least (Target + 313). I am setting mu_hat to 700 (approx 129 * 3 + 313) to ensure the system maintains stock for the high-demand January period. Lead time remains variable but averages 2 periods.
