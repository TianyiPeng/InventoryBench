This SKU is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' (denim), which often sees increased demand heading into spring (February/March). \n3. OR Baseline Evaluation: The OR recommendation is 92. This is based on a distribution across 1+L (3 periods). However, the OR formula often uses simple historical averages which may under-anticipate the current sharp upward trend (85 is almost at the cap). \n4. Adjustment: Given the strong positive momentum and the critical need to build initial stock (0 on-hand), I will increase the order slightly above the OR recommendation to 110 units.

Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 19, 46, 48, 62, 85, and most recently 67 in Period 1. This suggests a transition from winter into early spring fashion demand. 2. **Inventory Status**: On-hand is 0. Period 1 demand (67) was completely lost due to zero stock. We have 110 units in-transit (ordered Period 1). 3. **Lead Time Inference**: Promised lead time is 2. The order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). We will face a stockout in Period 2 and likely Period 3. 4. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand including P1 is approx 54.5. However, recent demand (P1) and the peak (85) suggest we should prepare for a higher regime around 65-75. 5. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 92 units based on historical data. 6. **Strategy**: Since we are currently stockblind (0 on-hand) and have a 110-unit order arriving in Period 3, the pipeline needs to be bolstered to cover Periods 4 and 5.

The SKU is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' denim, which likely sees a spring seasonal surge starting in February. The OR recommendation of 145 is based on a distribution that includes the low Jan/Feb historical samples, likely underestimating the current trend.\n3. Inventory & Strategy: On-hand is 0.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand was 19, 46, 48, 62, 85. Recent actual demand has spiked significantly: P1=67, P2=173, P3=156. The average of the last two periods is ~165, which is much higher than the initial samples. The product is 'Skinny High Waist Ankle-length jeans' and it's early March, aligning with the spring/summer transition for denim.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 460 units (110 from P1, 100 from P2, 250 from P3). We have missed 3 periods of sales (396 units lost demand).\n4. OR Recommendation: The OR suggests 0 units because the pipeline (460) exceeds its base-stock calculation (using initial low demand samples). However, the OR doesn't recognize the demand regime shift or the arrival delay. \n5. Decision: Total expected demand over the next 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 165 * 3 = 495 units.

Period 4's order (100 units) is expected in Period 6 (visibility in P7). 2. Inventory analysis: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is total 460, but since P1 (110 units) is likely lost, effective pipeline is 350 (P3: 250 + P4: 100). 3. Demand analysis: History shows 67, 173, 156, 110. Average demand is ~126 units/week. Since the product is 'Ankle-length jeans in washed, stretch denim' and we are approaching mid-March, demand likely remains steady or increases slightly with spring seasonality. 4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 0 units because it counts the lost 110 units from P1 in the pipeline (460 total) and uses a capped policy. 5. Strategy: I need to cover demand for Period 5, 6, and 7 (L+1). Total demand needed is roughly 126 * 3 = 378 units. Effective pipeline (excluding lost P1) is 350.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand (last 5 periods: 67, 173, 156, 110, 67) shows high volatility but averages around 115 units per period. The recent demand of 67 might be skewed by the stockout (customers not seeing product). 3. OR Baseline: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 610 units in-transit (including the lost 110 Period 1 order) and believes the system is oversupplied relative to the base stock. 4. Strategic Adjustment: We must discount the lost 110 units. Effective In-transit = 610 - 110 = 500 units. On-hand is 0. Expected arrivals: P6 (Order P3: 250), P7 (Order P4: 100), P8 (Order P5: 150).

This suggests a highly unreliable supply chain with roughly a 50% loss rate or severe delays.\n2. Demand Analysis: Product is 'Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans' (Ladies Denim). Recent demand (P1-P7) averages 114 units/period, significantly higher than the pre-game historical average (~52). Recent demand is fairly stable around 110-120 units.\n3.

Total 'reliable' in-transit is likely only 130 units.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it views 590 units in-transit as valid supply.

The order from P8 (120 units) was placed with an expected arrival in P9 or P10; it did not arrive in P9, so it is highly likely to arrive in P10. The order from P9 (120 units) is expected in P10 or P11.\n2. Inventory Position: Current on-hand is 34. In-transit is nominally 700, but adjusting for confirmed losses (110+250+100=460), the effective in-transit is 240 units (P8 and P9 orders). \n3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile: 67, 107, 121, 74, 22. The drop to 22 in Period 9 might be a temporary dip or the start of a seasonal shift. However, Spring weather usually sustains denim demand. Average demand since P1 is ~99 units/period.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the 'In-transit' figure of 700. Since we know 460 of those units are lost, we must protect against a stockout if the P8 or P9 orders are also delayed or lost. Expected demand for the coverage window (P10-P12) is ~300 units.

The total pipeline is 510 units, but historical 'Carry-over insights' from Period 8 confirm that units ordered in P1 (110), P3 (250), and P4 (100) are lost. This leaves an effective in-transit quantity of only 50 units (ordered in P10), which are now extremely overdue and likely also lost. Demand Outlook: The recent surge (average 51 units/week over P20-P21) suggests a potential mid-summer demand recovery for these skinny ankle jeans. A lead time of 2 periods means we must cover demand for P22, P23, and P24. Even at a conservative demand of 50 units/period, we need ~150 units. With only 16 units on hand and a high probability that the existing 510 'in-transit' units will never arrive (based on the documented history of lost shipments), a safety order is necessary.

The current on-hand inventory is 14 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 960 units is highly misleading: 510 units are confirmed lost (from P1-P10), and the remaining units are orders from P22, P24, P25, and P26. Specifically, the P22 order (150) is delayed (now 5 periods late), the P23 order arrived at P26 (3-period lead time), while orders from P24, P25, and P26 are still within the expected delivery window of 1-3 periods. The OR recommendation of 0 is based on a literal interpretation of total pipeline inventory (960) against historical averages, failing to account for lost shipments and the recent demand surge. Given the erratic delivery lead times (averaging 2-3 periods recently) and the strong sales (136 units sold last period), I need to maintain a pipeline that covers at least 3 periods of demand (~330-350 units). Excluding the 510 lost units and the 150 likely lost/stuck from P22, the 'real' pipeline is approximately 450 units (P24, P25, P26 orders).

Total In-Transit is 960 units, but after subtracting the 510 lost units and the arrivals from P22, P23, and P25, the active pipeline consists of orders from P24 (150 units), P26 (150 units), and P27 (150 units), totaling 450 units. Demand Analysis: The SKU (skinny denim jeans) is in a high-demand summer regime. Demand over the last two periods was 136 and 109. The average for the 'recovery' period (P20-P27) is approximately 91 units/week. Inventory Strategy: Current on-hand is 55. We need to cover demand for current period (P28) plus the lead time periods (L=2 or 3). Assuming a planning horizon of 4 periods at 110 units/week (440 total), our current effective inventory (On-hand 55 + Active Pipeline 450 = 505) is sufficient to cover about 4.5 periods. The OR algorithm recommends 0 because it includes the 510 lost units in its pipeline calculation.

Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is skewed by the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of lost shipments. I must replenish the stock to cover the 3-period lead time (L+1 = 4 periods).

The current 'In-transit' of 1510 is highly inflated by these phantom units. The only reliable pipeline consist of orders from P32 onwards (150 units in P32, 150 in P33, 150 in P34).

{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation of 0 units is primarily driven by the 'In-transit' metric (1,460 units), which suggests the system is overstocked. However, as established in previous period insights, a cumulative total of 1,360 units are confirmed lost or dead (510 from P1-10, 150 each from P22, P24, P26, and P38, plus 250 from P29). Subtracting these lost units from the 1,460 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of only 100 units (specifically the order from P43). Current on-hand inventory is 149 units. Demand has stabilized into a winter regime averaging ~50 units per week (periods 39-43 avg: 51). With an effective lead time of 3 periods, we need to cover demand for periods 44, 45, 46, and 47 (approx 200 units). Current inventory (149) plus the reliable in-transit order (100) totals 249 units. While this technically covers the remaining periods of the game (which ends at Period 47), the risk of another lost shipment is high given the supply chain history. I will place a safety order of 50 units to ensure service levels through the final periods, overriding the OR's recommendation which is blinded by the lost units in the pipeline.",

  "rationale": "The SKU '636323003' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a low-demand phase, consistent with seasonal shifts observed previously (average demand ~40 units/week over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 120 units, providing approximately 3 periods of cover. Pipeline analysis: The 'In-transit' figure of 1510 is highly misleading. Cumulative lost units (P1-10: 510; P22: 150; P24: 150; P26: 150; P29: 250; P34: 150; P38: 150) total 1510 units\u2014exactly matching the 'In-transit' metric. This means there are ZERO viable units currently in the pipeline. Although demand is low, the effective lead time is 3 periods. If I place 0 units as OR suggests, and demand remains at ~40, I will stock out in Period 48. To maintain a safe buffer through the end of the game (Period 47), I need to account for the 3-period lead time. Order placed today (P45) arrives in P48. Current inventory (120) must cover P45, P46, and P47. Estimated demand: 3 periods * 40 units = 120 units. I will order 50 units to ensure availability for the final periods and mitigate any slight demand spikes, as the current pipeline is entirely comprised of lost orders.",

The In-transit figure of 1460 is misleading; as documented in Carry-over Insights (P45), all 1360 units ordered prior to Period 40 are confirmed lost. The actual reliable pipeline includes only orders from Period 44 (50 units) and Period 45 (50 units). Effective Inventory = 194 (on-hand) + 100 (reliable pipeline) = 294 units. Demand Analysis: The SKU is in a low-demand winter regime. Recent demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) has averaged 43 units/week (38, 37, 85, 47, 29, 26). The OR algorithm recommends 0 units, likely because it includes the phantom 'In-transit' stock and observes the current low demand trend. Strategy: Current effective inventory of 294 units covers approximately 6.8 weeks of demand at the current average. Given the reliable lead time is 2-3 periods, we are currently overstocked for the short term. However, to maintain a steady flow and account for further potential shipment losses, a small maintenance order is prudent.",
