Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 678691002 (High Support Bra). Demand history shows 5 data points: 81, 48, 71, 68, 74. The mean is 68.4 and the standard deviation is 12.5. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Since we have no inventory (on-hand 0, in-transit 0), we need to place an order immediately. The dates (late January/early February) don't suggest an immediate major holiday spike yet, but the product is a sports bra, which often sees steady demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (2 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all 5 historical data points. This will set mu_hat = (1+2)*68.4 = 205.2 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2)*12.5 = 21.65. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering lead time plus current period demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the product (High Support Sports Bra), demand in January averaged ~68 units/week. The actual demand in P1 was 56. We currently have 0 on-hand and 89 in-transit (ordered in P1). Promised lead time is 2. Since arrivals happen during the period and are visible in the next 'conclude' message, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. Currently, there is a total stockout (sold 0 due to 0 on-hand). The objective is to set parameters that cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the 5 historical samples plus P1 (81, 48, 71, 68, 74, 56), the mean is 66.3. Since there's no clear seasonal shift yet in February, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all available data points including the P1 demand of 56. L is set to default (promised 2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a high-support sports bra, and the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (89 units) and Period 2 (87 units) are currently in transit (total 176 units). In Period 1 and 2, demand was 56 and 60 units respectively, but sold units were 0 because on-hand inventory was 0. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. If it arrives as promised, it will be visible in the Period 3 'conclude' message. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are [81, 48, 71, 68, 74], averaging 68.4. Recent demand in P1 and P2 (56, 60) is slightly lower than the historical average. I will use a conservative average of the last 7 samples (including P1 and P2) to set mu_hat, which is (81+48+71+68+74+56+60)/7 = 65.4 per period. Total mu_hat = (1+L)*65.4 = 3 * 65.4 = 196.2. I'll use the default lead time and standard deviation settings as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 2 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019/3/4). Historical demand for this 'Sports bra' has been consistent, with samples: 81, 48, 71, 68, 74, 56, 60, 54. The average weekly demand is approximately 64 units. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in P1 (89 units), P2 (87), and P3 (37). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a lead time of at least 3 periods or a potential shipment delay. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales for 3 consecutive periods, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed delay. For demand, I will use an average of the last 8 samples (mean \u2248 64). Therefore, mu_hat = (1+3) * 64 = 256. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(1+3) * std_dev(approx 11) \u2248 22. This aggressive base stock aims to recover from the stockout as soon as shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is likely 3 periods, not the promised 2 (P1 order did not arrive by P3 conclude).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11, 2019. The SKU is a 'Carina High Support Bra'. Historical demand (from game history and samples) remains stable around a mean of 60-70 units per week. Analysis of 'Period 4 conclude' shows that the order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2 periods), which matches the promised lead time. This contradicts the previous suspicion in Carry-over Insights that lead time was 3 periods. However, the order from Period 1 (89 units) has NOT arrived yet (it should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2, or Period 4 if L=3). This suggests the Period 1 shipment is likely lost. I will revert L to the promised 2 periods (default), as the most recent arrival (P2) confirmed it. Demand is stable, so I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current mean (approx 68 per week) and variance. mu_hat will be calculated as (1+L)*mean_demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (89 units) is likely lost; Period 2 order arrival confirms lead time is 2 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a high-support sports bra. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged 68.4. Realized demand in P1-P5 averaged 57.4. There is no strong evidence of seasonal shifts yet, despite it being mid-March. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. Period 1 order (89 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 5 periods since ordering (promised L=2). Period 2 order arrived in P4 (actual L=2). Since P1 is lost, our 'In-transit' of 188 actually includes orders from P3 (37), P4 (62), and the unknown order from P5 (0 units ordered, so pipeline is P3+P4 = 99 units). The OR backend's pipeline calculation will think we have 188 units (P1+P3+P4 + others), but 89 are dead units. To compensate for the 'phantom' 89 units in pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher to force the base stock level up, or use a method that ignores the lost units. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline_inventory (188) from the base_stock, I must ensure base_stock >= 188 + next period's needs. Predicted demand for L+1 (3 periods) is ~205. If pipeline is 188, the order would only be 17. But since 89 units are lost, we actually only have 99 coming. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure we cover the lost stock and current demand. Calculation: Expected demand for P6, P7, P8 is ~195 units. We have 0 on-hand. Reliable pipeline is 99 (P3+P4). Gap is 96 units. To make the OR engine order ~96 units when it sees 188 in pipeline, I need base_stock around 284. Setting mu_hat to 284.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (89 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed, L=2). Inventory deficit of 89 units relative to system 'In-transit' records.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (High Support Sports Bra) is entering spring. Historical demand mean is approximately 63 units/period (samples: 56, 60, 54, 65, 52, 70). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the Period 1 order (89 units) is confirmed lost, creating a persistent deficit between actual stock and the OR backend's pipeline calculations. Although In-transit shows 300 units, 89 of those will never arrive. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). To compensate for the lost 89 units and the current stockout (on-hand 0), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Forecasted demand for (L+1=3) periods is 3 * 63 = 189 units. To recover the 89 lost units, I am setting mu_hat to 189 + 89 = 278. This forces the OR backend to place an order that covers both upcoming demand and the missing 'phantom' inventory it believes is in transit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a high-support sports bra, and we are entering spring, which typically sees steady demand for activewear. Historical demand samples (recent 5 weeks: 65, 52, 70, 63, and an average of 68 in Jan/Feb) suggest a stable demand regime around 60-70 units/week. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0. The Period 1 order (89 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 7 periods since the order and L=2. The 'In-transit' figure of 300 units includes this lost 89, meaning effective pipeline is actually 211 (300-89). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the deficit left by the lost shipment, I will keep L at default (2) because the P2-to-P4 arrival confirmed the lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (covering the most recent demand periods) to capture the current mean of ~62.6. For sigma_hat, default will suffice as volatility remains consistent with historical samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This is a high-support sports bra (CARINA HIGH SUPPORT BRA), which typically sees steady demand in early spring as fitness activities increase. Demand samples (81, 48, 71, 68, 74, 56, 60, 54, 65, 52, 70, 63, 81) show a relatively stable mean around 65 units per week, with a slight uptick in the most recent period (81). Lead time has been consistently 2 periods for the successful deliveries (P2 arrived P4, P6 arrived P8), confirming L=2. However, the P1 order (89 units) is confirmed lost, creating a persistent inventory deficit of 89 units between the system's 'In-transit' record (188) and actual expected arrivals (188 - 89 = 99). The pipeline inventory currently consists of P3 (37) and P4 (62), totaling 99 units. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' (188) to calculate the order (order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), it will under-order by exactly 89 units. To compensate for this 89-unit phantom inventory, I will inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Forecast demand is ~65 units/period; for L=2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+2)*65 = 195. I will set mu_hat to 195 + 89 = 284 to force the backend to place an order that covers the lost units, while keeping L at 'default' (2) and sigma_hat at 'default' to handle normal variance.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. We are managing a high-support sports bra. Demand history shows a steady mean of approximately 64 units per week across the last 9 samples, with a slight seasonal uptick observed around late March/early April (Spring season fitness push). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The Period 1 order (89 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 9 periods since it was placed with a promised lead time of 2. This loss explains why we are hitting stockouts despite the OR engine's 'In-transit' count of 269 units (which includes the lost 89). Actual lead time remains consistent at 2 periods (orders from P2 and P6 arrived exactly after 2 periods). To compensate for the 89-unit phantom inventory in the OR system and the current stockout, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock: (1+L)*Mean + z*sigma. Mean ~ 64, L=2, so (1+2)*64 = 192. Adding the 89 units lost to the required base stock to force an order through the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic suggests mu_hat should target a value higher than normal. However, I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=9) to capture the full history since the start of recording, and rely on the OR backend's service level logic. To address the lost stock specifically, I am using an explicit mu_hat to ensure the next order covers the gap.

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockout persists due to the Period 1 lost order (89 units), causing the OR engine to over-estimate pipeline inventory by 89 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sport Bra) shows a significant issue with pipeline accounting. A Period 1 order of 89 units is confirmed lost (10 periods have passed since it was ordered with a promised lead time of 2). Because the backend OR engine believes these 89 units are still in-transit, it systematically under-orders, leading to recurring stockouts and lost sales. To correct for this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to bridge the 89-unit gap while also accounting for current demand patterns. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged ~34 units/week, a significant drop from the earlier average (~63 units/week). My forecast for the 3-period lead-time window (L+1=3) is 102 units (3 * 34). Adding the 89 missing units to the target inventory requires mu_hat to be set to 191 (102 + 89). This forces the backend to place an order that offsets the ghost inventory. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods based on P2 and P6 orders, though P9 arrived in only 1 period; 'calculate' will be used to keep L stable. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockout corrected in P11 by inflating mu_hat by 89 units to offset the Period 1 lost order; demand regime has shifted lower to ~34 units/avg since P9 (2019/4/08).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Carina High Support Bra has shifted from a mean of ~65 units to a lower regime of ~34 units per period starting 2019/4/08 (Period 9). The current on-hand inventory is 15 units. In-transit is recorded at 223 units, but this includes the 89 units from Period 1 that were confirmed lost, meaning the functional pipeline is 134 units (comprising the Period 3 order of 37 units, Period 4 order of 62 units, and Period 10 order of 35 units). Since L=2, the total pipeline requirement (L+1 period demand) is ~102 units. The OR engine incorrectly sees 223 units in transit, which would suppress all new ordering. To correct this and account for the 89-unit phantom inventory, I will continue to use an explicit mu_hat boost just until the base stock target rises enough to trigger an order. The current forecast is (1+L)*34 = 102 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower demand regime (avg ~34), but I'll set L to 'default' as the lead time has stabilized at 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift at Period 9 (2019/4/08): mean demand decreased from ~65 to ~34 (-48%). Lost Period 1 order (89 units) continues to inflate system 'In-transit' records.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Carina High Support Bra entered a lower regime starting Period 9 (2019/04/08), averaging approximately 38 units over the last four periods (35, 34, 32, 51). The Period 1 order (89 units) is confirmed lost, but it remains in the OR engine's 'In-transit' records, causing the system to consistently under-order by exactly 89 units. To compensate, I must continue to inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset this phantom inventory. With on-hand at 0 and a current pipeline of 223 (which includes the 89 lost units), the effective pipeline is 134. Since the demand has shifted, I'll use a recent 4-period window (N=4) to forecast. The forecast mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * mean_demand + Lost_Order_Adjustment. With L=2 (promised and recently observed), (1+2)*38 + 89 = 114 + 89 = 203. For sigma_hat, I will use the recent volatility (N=4) to match the new demand regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (starting Period 9) is significantly lower than the initial historical data, averaging approximately 40 units per week (35, 34, 32, 51, 47). I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture this shift. The Period 1 lost order (89 units) still resides in the 'In-transit' records (total 223 - Period 10's 35 - Period 9's 81 - Period 6's 0... it appears Period 1's 89 units are still counted in the 223 total). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, it will under-order by exactly 89 units. In Period 11, I attempted to offset this; however, currently, on-hand is 0 and we are in a stockout. To force an order that covers the pipeline deficit, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Expected demand over L+1 (3 periods) is 3 * 40 = 120. To offset the 89-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set to 120 + 89 = 209. Recent lead times show arrivals at 2 or even 1 period, so L=default (2) is appropriate. Sigma_hat will use N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Analysis of historical data shows a demand regime shift occurring around Period 9 (2019/4/08), where average weekly demand dropped from ~65 to ~34 units. We are also factoring in a known issue: the Period 1 order of 89 units is lost, which causes the OR engine to overstate 'In-transit' inventory. To compensate for this 89-unit deficit and prevent the engine from under-ordering, I am choosing to use 'explicit' for mu_hat. The calculation for mu_hat is based on the recent demand mean of 34 units across (L+1) periods (where L=2), plus an 89-unit offset to cancel out the ghost inventory from Period 1. Thus, mu_hat = (1+2)*34 + 89 = 191. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the volatility within the current low-demand regime. Lead time 'L' remains at the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P4, P8, P10) confirm an actual lead time of 1-2 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) is currently in a systemic stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Since Period 9, demand has entered a lower regime averaging approximately 43 units per week (Avg P9-P15). However, a shipment of 89 units from Period 1 is confirmed lost. This lost order remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total: 223), causing the OR engine to underestimate the required order size because it believes those 89 units are still coming. To correct for this 'phantom inventory', I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory level by 89 units. The calculated base demand for (L+1=3) periods is 129 units (43 * 3). Adding the 89-unit correction results in 218. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) captures the recent volatility. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a systemic stockout (On-hand: 0) at Period 17 (2019/6/3). The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 9 (~2019/4/08) from a mean of ~65 to ~42.3 (mean of the last 8 periods). A critical issue identified in previous periods is that the Period 1 order of 89 units was lost, but remains 'In-transit' in the OR engine's pipeline calculations. This causes the backend to underestimate the required order by 89 units. To compensate, I am applying an 'explicit' mu_hat of 216. This is calculated as: ((1 + L) * Forecasted Demand) + Lost Units offset. With L=2 and mean demand ~42.3, (1+2)*42.3 = 127. Adding the lost 89 units gives 216. This forces the backend to place an order that clears the phantom inventory and covers the expected mean lead-time demand. Standard L=2 (promised) is used as it remains generally accurate despite the P1 loss. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=8 to capture the volatility of the new regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678691002' (High Support Sports Bra) is currently in a systemic stockout state. The primary obstacle is the Period 1 order (89 units), which was confirmed lost in Period 6 but remains in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 223). This ghost inventory prevents the OR engine from placing sufficient new orders because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. Since Period 9, the demand regime has shifted lower, averaging ~41 units per period (last 9 samples: 35, 34, 32, 51, 47, 36, 66, 37, 40). To bypass the pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand plus the 89-unit deficit. Calculation: (3 periods * 41 avg demand) + 89 lost units = 212 units. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P10, P17) show actual lead times of 1, despite the promised 2. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=9) to capture the volatility of the current lower-demand regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678691002' (High Support Bra) is experiencing a severe stockout. Note that the Period 1 order of 89 units is confirmed lost (per Period 6 insight), yet it remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (228 units). Of the 228 units 'In-transit', 89 are phantom units. To compensate for the OR engine's belief that these units exist, I must inflate mu_hat. Demand since Period 9 (late spring/early summer) has stabilized at a lower mean. Comparing recent demand (Periods 9-18), the average is approximately 42 units/period. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2 (promised), base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~126 units). However, because the system subtracts the phantom 89 units from its order calculation, I must add 89 units to the expected demand to force an order. I set mu_hat explicitly to (42 * 3) + 89 = 215. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the current period's volatility accurately.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). A critical persistent issue is the lost Period 1 order of 89 units, which remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (226 units), causing the OR engine to underestimate the required order size by 89 units. Furthermore, the demand regime shifted at Period 9: prior mean was ~65, while the mean from Period 9 to 19 is ~41. Recent lead times have stabilized at 1 period (observed at P10, P17, P19), though the promised lead time is 2. To account for the lost stock and the shifted demand, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 89-unit phantom inventory. Calculating needed mu_hat: L=2 (promised), L+1=3 periods. New mean ~41. 3 * 41 = 123. Adding 89 units to offset the 'In-transit' error results in 212. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this correction is applied despite the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has consistently been 1 period for the last 3 arrivals (P10, P17, P19), suggesting a shift from the promised 2 periods. Continued systemic 'In-transit' inflation of 89 units due to the lost P1 order must be manually offset in mu_hat.

Since Period 9 (2019/4/08), demand has entered a lower regime averaging approximately 42 units per period, although recent weeks show a slight upward trend (~50 units/period). The most critical issue is the systemic stockout caused by the lost Period 1 order (89 units), which remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (228 units). This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to under-order. To correct this, I must set mu_hat to 'explicit' and include an 89-unit offset to force the engine to place an order. For lead time, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3, as the last three arrivals (P10, P17, P19) all arrived with a lead time of 1 period, suggesting a shift from the promised 2 periods. Forecast calculation: Recent demand (last 3 periods) average is 48.6. Forecast for L+1 (2 periods) = 48.6 * 2 = 97.2. Adding the 89-unit lost order offset results in 186.2. I will set mu_hat to 186 to ensure the engine orders enough to cover the actual deficit.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time has stabilized at 1 period for the last 3 deliveries (observed P10, P17, P19).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) is currently experiencing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis confirms a lost shipment from Period 1 (89 units) that continues to inflate the system's 'In-transit' record (currently 228, but 89 are phantom units). This causes the OR engine to under-order. To correct for this, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by 89 units. Regarding lead time, the last three deliveries (Periods 10, 17, and 19) all arrived with a lead time of 1, effectively shifting the observed lead time from the promised 2 down to 1. The demand regime from Period 9 onwards has stabilized around an average of ~41 units per week (the last 13 samples average 40.7), though recent volatility has been high. For parameters: L is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the shift to a 1-period lead time. mu_hat is set to 'explicit' to include the 89-unit offset: Forecast = (1 + L) * Avg_Demand + Lost_Units. With L=1 and Avg_Demand \u2248 41, Forecast = (2 * 41) + 89 = 171. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=13) to capture the variability since the demand regime changed in April (Period 9).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a systemic stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' value of 226 units includes the lost Period 1 order (89 units) and other undelivered quantities, creating a significant pipeline inflation. Based on the history, actual lead time (L) has drifted between 1 and 2 periods; P22 saw an arrival with L=2, so I will use L=2 to be conservative. The demand regime shifted around Period 9 from ~65 to ~40 units/week. Since P20, demand has averaged 38 units. To recover from the stockout and offset the 89-unit phantom pipeline, I need to set mu_hat such that the OR engine orders enough to cover the actual deficit. Target base stock = (L+1)*demand_avg + safety_stock. With L=2 and avg demand ~40, base stock should be ~120 + safety. However, the system thinks I have 226 in transit, so it will order 0 unless I set mu_hat > (In-transit + On-hand). I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to 400. This is calculated as (L+1)*42 (forecasted demand) + 89 (offset for lost P1 order) + 185 (additional buffer to force replenishment past the inflated in-transit). This aggressive setting ensures the backend places an order despite the incorrect in-transit data.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Lead time returned to 2 periods (P20 order arrived in P22). Systemic stockout continues; 'In-transit' remains inflated by exactly 89 units from P1 lost shipment.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The SKU is a high-support sports bra, and we are in the summer peak season. Demand since Period 9 (April) had stabilized around an average of 42 units, but recent periods (P18-P23) show a slight uptick to an average of ~42.5. However, there is a massive systemic issue: a lost shipment from Period 1 (89 units) remains 'In-transit' in the system perpetually, leading the OR engine to underestimate the required order because it believes there is 89 units of pipeline inventory that will never arrive. To correct this, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 89 units to force the engine to 'buy back' the missing stock. Additionally, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time. mu_hat will be set using an explicit value. Calculation for mu_hat: Base forecast is roughly 43 units/period. For a lead time of 2, (1+L) * mean = 3 * 43 = 129. Adding the 89-unit 'ghost inventory' offset yields 218. I will use 220 to ensure sufficient service level and recover from the ongoing stockout.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) is currently in a systemic stockout state. There is a persistent inventory discrepancy of 89 units due to the lost shipment from Period 1, which remains in the system's 'In-transit' count, causing the OR engine to under-order. Additionally, the recent demand regime (since Period 9, April 2019) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 39 units per period compared to the initial high-demand period. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, with the most recent arrival (P22) confirming a return to the promised 2-period lead time. To correct the systemic stockout and account for the 89-unit 'ghost' inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Mean + Offset = (1 + 2) * 39 + 89 = 117 + 89 = 206. This ensures the OR backend places an order large enough to clear the trailing stockout and cover future demand. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the volatility of the current demand regime since P9.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a prolonged stockout state due to a systemic inventory imbalance. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 379 units is misleading because it includes 89 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost, plus several subsequent orders (P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35) that are now significantly past the observed lead time and likely lost. The only reliable 'In-transit' quantity is the 153 units ordered in Period 23. To overcome the OR engine's wait-and-see behavior (which assumes missing pipeline inventory will arrive), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The demand regime since Period 9 (April) has averaged ~40 units/period (mean of last 17 samples is 40.5). With a base lead time of 2, the total required stock for (L+1) periods is 3 periods * 40.5 = 121.5 units. However, because the system believes the pipeline is full (379 units in-transit), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger a restoration order. I will set mu_hat to 122 units + 89 units (P1 loss) + 134 units (P3, P4, P10 likely losses) = 345 units to force the backend to place a corrective order that replenishes stock given the actual 0 on-hand and 153 reliable in-transit units. Following the most recent arrival (P22), I will revert L to the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative lost units (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35) totals 223 units. This phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' record prevents the OR engine from ordering unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated. Current demand regime since P9 (2019/4/08) averages ~40 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '678691002' (Sports bra) currently has 119 units on-hand after a shipment of 153 units arrived in Period 26. However, there is a significant systemic issue with the 'In-transit' record. Based on the carry-over history, a cumulative total of 223 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10) are effectively 'lost' but remain in the 'In-transit' tally (Current In-transit: 226 units; 223 of which are phantom). This prevents the OR engine's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) from triggering new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To correct this, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime (since Period 9) to be approximately 40 units/period. With a lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 120 units. To offset the 223 phantom units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 120 + 223 = 343. This will allow the engine to order units needed to maintain the 40-unit/week flow. For L, I use 'calculate' as recent arrivals have varied between 1, 2, and 3 periods, suggesting the backend should average these observations. For sigma_hat, I use 'recent_N' with N=18 to capture the volatility of the current lower-demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-support sports bra with current demand averaging ~38 units/week since Period 9. A critical systemic issue exists: cumulative lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 total 223 units. These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' record (Total In-transit: 240, of which only 17 are likely live orders from P27 and P28). This 'phantom inventory' prevents the OR engine from ordering replacement stock unless compensated. To resolve this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target base stock = (Lead Time + 1) * Demand + Phantom Inventory. Since the most recent delivery (P23 order) took 3 periods, I'll estimate L=3. Thus, Base Stock = (3+1)*38 + 223 = 152 + 223 = 375. By setting mu_hat=375, the backend should subtract the 240 in-transit and 62 on-hand, triggering an order of ~73 units to maintain service levels and account for the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost units confirmed: 223 units (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35). This remains in system 'In-transit' records, requiring an explicit mu_hat offset. Demand regime stable at ~38/week. Lead time increased to 3 periods in P26.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/26. The product is a high-support sports bra, and we are entering the late summer/early autumn period. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since approximately Period 9 (2019/04/08). Calculating mean demand from P9 to P28 (20 samples) gives an average of 39.7 units per period. The critical issue remains the cumulative 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 223 units (from P1, P3, P4, and P10 losses) which still populates the OR engine's pipeline accounting. This prevents the system from triggering new orders because it 'thinks' 223 units are coming, while they are actually lost. Therefore, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass this. My target base stock level is (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. Observed lead time (L) has drifted between 1 and 3 periods recently; I will use L=2 (promised) as a baseline. Target base stock = (2+1) * 40 + ~55 (safety stock for volatility) \u2248 175 units. However, I must explicitly add the 223 lost units to this total so the OR engine subtracts the 223 units it 'sees' in transit and still places an order for the actual required amount. mu_hat = 175 + 223 = 398. sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=20 to capture the current regime's volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' record is currently inflated by 223 units due to four historically lost shipments (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35). This 'phantom inventory' causes the OR engine to under-order or stop ordering entirely unless the mu_hat parameter is explicitly adjusted to offset the deficit. Demand since Period 9 has stabilized into a lower regime, averaging 38.6 units per week (periods 9-29). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will use L=3 (explicit) to remain conservative given the high stockout risk history. To ensure the OR engine triggers an order that covers the next 4 weeks (L+1) of demand plus the 223 unit phantom deficit, I set mu_hat to (4 * 38.6) + 223 \u2248 377. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent variance. Current On-hand is nearly depleted (4 units), and recent orders (P27, P28, P29) total 154 units (377 - 223 = 154), demonstrating that this offset strategy successfully forces necessary replenishment.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 9 (2019/4/08) has been stable with a mean of approximately 38 units/week. My current on-hand inventory is 71 units. The 'In-transit' record (291 units) is heavily inflated by several historical lost shipments (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35). Total cumulative lost units = 223 units. These units will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock calculation, effectively preventing new orders and causing stockouts. To correct for this 223-unit phantom inventory, I am inflating mu_hat to (Mean Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. The most recent lead times have been 2 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts during the transition back to regular ordering. Mu_hat calculation: (38 units/week * 4 weeks) + 223 lost units = 375. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent standard deviation (~10-12 units/week) scaled for L=3: 12 * sqrt(4) = 24.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product (High Support Sports Bra) is in a stable demand regime that began around Period 9 (late spring), averaging ~38 units per week (the mean of the last 20 samples is 38.6). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrivals (P27, P28 arriving in P30) showing 2-3 periods; I will assume L=2 (promised) as an average expectation. The most critical factor remains the 223 units of cumulative lost shipments (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35) that still appear in the 'In-transit' figure of 325 units. The actual physical pipeline is only 102 units (325 - 223). To force the OR engine to account for this 223-unit gap and actually place orders, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. The required base stock at a ~0.8 service level (calculated from profit $4 and holding $1) is approximately 3 * 38 + buffer. To clear the phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to the expected demand across (L+1) plus the lost 223 units. Calculation: (38 * 3) + 223 = 114 + 223 = 337. This ensures the engine's 'base stock - pipeline' calculation (337 - 325) allows for a replenishment order of ~12 units plus safety stock adjustments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 9 (2019-04-08) has remained stabilized around a mean of 38 units/week. Most recently, demand has trended slightly lower (average of 24.5 units over the last 4 periods). Lead times have been fluctuating between 1, 2, and 3 periods; the OR backend defaults to 2, which is a reasonable middle ground given the variability. The critical issue remains the 223 units (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35) that are listed in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost based on historical analysis. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', these 223 'phantom' units prevent the system from placing necessary replenishment orders unless the base_stock calculation is adjusted. With on-hand inventory at 81 units, we have coverage for the immediate demand (~2 weeks), but we must signal the backend to order by inflating the mu_hat. Following the logic in Period 28, I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to (1+L)*mean_demand + lost_units. With L=2 and mean_demand ~38, calculation is (1+2)*38 + 223 = 114 + 223 = 337. This ensures the backend sees a required stock level that accounts for the fact that 223 units of its perceived pipeline are non-existent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Carina High Support Bra (Ladies Sport) has been in a lower regime since Period 9 (late April), averaging approximately 37 units per week. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 31.8 units. The cumulative lost units from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 total 223 units. These remain 'In-transit' in the system's records, creating a phantom inventory that prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders unless the base stock calculation is adjusted. With on-hand inventory at 27 and system in-transit at 274 (of which only 274 - 223 = 51 are likely real), the engine sees 301 total units. To ensure the engine orders to cover actual demand + the 223 unit deficit, mu_hat must be inflated. Observed lead times over the last 5 arrivals were 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, averaging 2.2; I will use L=2 (promised) as it remains the most frequent/stable estimate. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*37 + 223 \u2248 334 to force ordering through the phantom inventory gap while maintaining service levels for the real demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this sports bra SKU has been stable since April, averaging approximately 38 units per week (the last 10 weeks average 37.2). We are currently stocked out due to arrivals lagging slightly. Looking at recent 'conclude' messages: P30 order (19 units) arrived in P32 (L=2), P31 order (34 units) arrived in P32 (L=1). The P33 (2 units) and P34 (53 units) orders are still in transit. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 327 is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Based on the history, the lost units are: P1 (89), P3 (37), P4 (62), P10 (35), totaling 223 units. Therefore, the true pipeline is 327 - 223 = 104 units. To force the OR engine to order correctly despite this 223-unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*E[D] + Offset. Here, (1+2)*38 + 223 = 114 + 223 = 337. Using L=2 as the base estimate for planning. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern changes detected. Cumulative lost units remain at 223 (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 9 has stabilized at an average of approximately 38 units per week (\u03bc \u2248 38). However, the system's 'In-transit' record is significantly inflated by 223 units due to historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P10). Because the OR engine uses a base-stock policy where order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit), these 223 phantom units prevent necessary ordering. To force the OR engine to place orders, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this 223-unit gap. The target inventory level for a 2-period lead time (L=2) should cover 3 periods of demand (L+1), which is ~114 units. To achieve this while the system thinks it already has 223 units in transit (plus any legitimate recent orders), I set mu_hat to approximately 350-400. This compensates for the 223 lost units and targets a safety stock buffer. Lead time (L) is set to 2 as the recent deliveries (P30, P32) show it fluctuating between 1 and 3, with 2 being a reasonable median.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since P9 (2019-04-08) remains stable with an average of approximately 38 units/period. The current date (late October) for a sports bra SKU does not suggest an immediate seasonal spike. The critical issue remains the cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10) totaling 223 units. These units represent 'phantom' inventory in the system's 'In-transit' record (371 units total). Actual valid in-transit units are from P29 (46), P34 (53), and P36 (46), totaling 145 units. The OR engine perceives 371 units in the pipeline, which is an inflation of 226 units (consistent with the 223 calculated). To force the backend to place necessary orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the offset for lost units: (2+1)*38 + 223 \u2248 337. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability seen (1-3 periods). sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' (N=20) to capture the lower volatility of the current regime compared to the early game.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 is currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand regime has lowered significantly recently, averaging ~16 units/week over the last 5 periods compared to the previous ~38 units/week. However, a major systemic issue persists: 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 371 units, but I have confirmed through historical analysis that 223 units are definitively lost (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35). These 'phantom' units prevent the OR engine from placing any orders because it believes the pipeline is full. The remaining legitimate pipeline consists of P29 (46), P34 (53), and P36 (46), totaling 145 units. To force the OR backend to ignore the 223 lost units and satisfy current demand, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods) plus the 223 missing units. Calculated mu_hat = (3 * 34) + 223 \u2248 325. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the moderately stable but slightly lower recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern changes detected. Cumulative lost units remain at 223 (P1, P3, P4, P10). Recent demand (last 5 periods) has dipped further to ~16 units/week, but I will maintain the 34 units/week baseline for safety until this dip is sustained.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. In Period 39, on-hand inventory is 0. The system 'In-transit' figure is 371 units, but this includes 223 units from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10). The true functional pipeline is 148 units (371 - 223). This true pipeline consists of orders from P29 (46), P31 (34), P34 (53), and P36 (46), which total 179 - wait, let's re-calculate. True pipeline = Total units in transit (371) minus cumulative lost units (223) = 148 units. These units are likely the orders from P34 (53), P36 (46), and P29/P31 remnants. Recent demand (last 5-10 weeks) averages ~28 units/week, though there was a dip to ~16 units/week that appears to be recovering (P38 demand was 34). I will use a mu_hat calculation of (1+L) * 34 units/week to reflect the established demand regime, but I must add the 223 units lost shipment offset to the mu_hat parameter to force the OR backend to place an order, as it currently believes those 223 phantom units will satisfy future demand. Lead time has been volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to account for the massive phantom inventory discrepancy.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift that occurred around Period 9 (late April), where demand dropped from ~65 units/week to approximately 35 units/week. Recent data (last 5-8 periods) suggests a further softening toward ~20-25 units/week. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2). Crucially, the system's 'In-transit' record remains inflated by 223 units due to historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10). These units will never arrive, but the OR engine counts them toward the inventory position. To force the OR engine to place orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that covers future demand and offsets these 223 phantom units. I am forecasting a base demand of 34 units/week. With an expected lead time of 2 periods (L=2, meaning 3 periods of protection needed), the required inventory position is 3 * 34 = 102. To achieve this despite the 223 unit phantom inflation, mu_hat must be set to 102 + 223 = 325. This ensures the OR engine maintains enough physical on-hand stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 32) has shifted significantly lower, averaging ~25 units/week compared to the previous regime of ~40 units/week. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this shift. The cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10) total 223 units. These units remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (current in-transit is 325, but 223 are effectively 'phantom' stock), which prevents the OR engine from ordering sufficiently. To rectify this, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Base Mean = 25. Actual Lead Time (L) average is approximately 2. Mu_hat target = (1 + L) * Mean + Lost Units = (1 + 2) * 25 + 223 = 75 + 223 = 298. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=9 to reflect the lower volatility in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: mean demand decreased from ~40 to ~25 units/week. Cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10) total 223 units, requiring continuous explicit mu_hat inflation to offset in-transit reporting error.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 325 units, which is heavily inflated by 223 units of cumulative lost shipments (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35) that have never arrived. To counteract this 'phantom' inventory and allow the OR engine to place an order, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter. Since Period 32, demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 25 units/week. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will assume an average lead time (L) of 2. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Lost_Shipment_Offset. Calculating (1 + 2) * 25 + 223 = 298. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the inventory deficit. I will set sigma_hat to represent the volatility of the recent 25 units/week regime using any appropriate sample window from P32 onwards (N=10).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) is currently in a high-demand period, evidenced by the demand spike to 123 units in Period 42 (likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales given the date 2019/11/25). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have a major systemic issue: 223 units are recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost from orders in Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR engine from ordering enough units because it believes the pipeline is full (In-transit: 325, with 223 lost = only 102 actual units potentially arriving). To force the engine to order, I must inflate mu_hat by these 223 units. For the baseline demand, I am using the average of the last 11 periods (P32-P42), which is ~31.4 units/week, but I will adjust the explicit mu_hat to (1+L) * avg_demand + 223 offset. With lead time (L) estimated at 3 periods to be safe, mu_hat = (1+3) * 31.4 + 223 = 125.6 + 223 \u2248 349. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the recent demand volatility (16 to 123 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed demand spike in P42 (123 units) likely seasonal/holiday-related. Cumulative lost units (223) still require constant mu_hat padding to offset system in-transit reporting error.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a systemic stockout (On-hand: 0). Period 42 showed a significant demand spike (123 units), likely tied to holiday seasonality (Late November/December). Cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10) total 223 units, which remain in the system's 'In-transit' record (Total In-transit: 400). Since the OR engine calculates 'order = base_stock - In-transit', these 223 units act as 'phantom inventory', preventing orders from being placed. To force the engine to order, mu_hat must be inflated. The recent demand regime (P32 onwards) is approx 25 units/week. Lead time has been volatile but recently averaged ~2.5 periods (I will use L=3 for safety given the holiday period). I am setting mu_hat = (Forecasted Demand * (1+L)) + Offset = (25 * 4) + 223 = 323. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=12) to capture the higher volatility seen in the P42 spike.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the post-peak holiday season for a sports bra SKU, which saw a massive demand spike (123 units) in Period 42 (late Nov/Black Friday). Recent demand has since moderated (22 in P43, 9 in P44), confirming the spike was temporary. The cumulative lost units (Period 1, 3, 4, 10) total 223 units. These units are still reflected in the system's 'In-transit' figure (total 400), but will never arrive. To force the OR engine to order and maintain service levels, I must inflate mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. I estimate current baseline demand at ~25 units/week. Lead time (L) has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently; I will use L=3 for safety. The parameters are set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 223-unit deficit: (4 * 25) + 223 = 323. I use 'explicit' to ensure the deficit is handled, as the default logic would see the 400 'In-transit' units and stop ordering entirely.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 678691002 (Sports Bra) is currently experiencing a significant holiday demand surge. Period 42 showed 123 units and Period 45 hit a peak of 211 units, likely due to Christmas shopping and New Year 'fitness resolution' seasonality. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' record (325 units) is heavily inflated by 223 units of cumulative lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10) that never arrived. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to cover the deficit. Additionally, with the holiday peak occurring, demand is far exceeding the previous regime of ~25-40 units/week. I will set L to 2 (recent average) and use an explicit mu_hat of 550. This value is derived by taking a projected 2-period holiday demand (approx 160 units/period * 2 = 320) and adding the 223-unit 'phantom inventory' offset (320 + 223 = 543, rounded to 550 for safety). This ensures the backend recognizes a major inventory gap and orders to cover the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/New Year seasonality confirmed: Demand spiked to 123 (P42) and 211 (P45). High support sports bras are peaking in December/early January.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 (2019/12/30), entering the peak of the sports bra season (late December/early January), as evidenced by recent demand spikes of 123 (P42), 211 (P45), and 185 (P46). The product is a 'Carina High Support Bra', which matches the seasonal trend for fitness/resolution-driven demand. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 585 units is inflated by 223 units of cumulative lost shipments (P1: 89, P3: 37, P4: 62, P10: 35) that haven't arrived for dozens of periods. To force the OR engine to order and compensate for both the upcoming seasonal demand and this 'phantom' inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. mu_hat = ((L+1) * Expected Demand) + Phantom Inventory. With L=2, (3 * 150) + 223 = 673. Using 150 as a conservative average for the peak weeks. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently, and sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for high volatility during this spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/New Year demand spike confirmed: P42, P45, P46 show significant shift in volume (~173 units/avg) due to sports bra seasonality and resolutions.
