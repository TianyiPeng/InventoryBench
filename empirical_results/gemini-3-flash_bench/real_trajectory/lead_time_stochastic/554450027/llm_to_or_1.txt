Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS, a basic apparel item. Historical demand from the five preceding weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows an upward trend: 132, 100, 122, 148, 152. The mean of these samples is 130.8 with a standard deviation of 21.6. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total exposure period is L+1 = 3 weeks. Given the recent climb towards 150 units/week, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent growth while smoothing variability. For lead time, I will stick to the 'default' (promised L=2) as we have no arrival history yet to suggest otherwise. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to achieve a service level of approximately 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a standard skinny jean. In Period 1, we ordered 166 units with a promised lead time of 2. There was a demand of 163 units in Period 1, which resulted in 163 lost sales since starting inventory was 0. The current in-transit is 166 units (ordered in P1), which is expected to arrive in Period 3 (P1 + 2). Historical demand data shows five weeks of data (132, 100, 122, 148, 152) plus the P1 demand of 163, showing a slight upward trend. The mean demand across all 6 samples is 136.16. Since L=2, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the recent slight increase in demand (148, 152, 163), and default for L and sigma_hat as there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation or abnormal volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 3 (2019/02/25), we are managing a 'Super-skinny denim' SKU. Historical demand (5 samples: 132, 100, 122, 148, 152) and recent gameplay demand (Period 1: 163, Period 2: 127) show a relatively stable mean around 135 units/week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed Period 1) has not arrived yet. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order (166 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. The Period 2 order (193 units) is expected in Period 4. Total in-transit (359) matches our orders. Since there is NO 'conclude' message yet confirming a lead time (as expected for L=2), I will stick to the default L=2. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (averaging the most recent 5 samples including gameplay) to capture the slight upward trend compared to early Jan samples, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a staple item (super-skinny denim). Historical demand samples (including the 5 initial samples and 3 gameplay weeks) show a mean of 129.5 units. Recent demand in the last 3 weeks (163, 127, 91) has been slightly more volatile. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (166 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of P3 and become visible in the P3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message still shows arrived=0 for SKU 554450027, and the starting on-hand for P4 is 0. This indicates that the P1 order is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Given that we have 453 units in transit (P1: 166, P2: 193, P3: 94) and 0 on-hand, we are currently experiencing stockouts. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to account for the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (P1, P2, P3 plus the two most recent pre-game samples) to capture recent levels while smoothing the recent drop in P3. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a 'Divided Collection' skinny denim trouser. Historical demand shows a slight downward trend over the last 5 weeks: 132, 100, 122, 148, 152 (pre-game) followed by 163, 127, 91, 89 (in-game). The mean of the last 4 in-game weeks is approximately 117.5. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Only one order (Period 2) has concluded, with an actual lead time of 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (166 units) has not yet arrived and is now 4 periods old (promised 2), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. However, since the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time, the logistics system is likely functioning, and Period 1 might be an outlier/loss. Currently, on-hand is 104 and in-transit is 400 (Orders from P1, P3, P4). I will set L to default (2). I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the recent stabilization/slight decline in demand around 110-120 units per week, ensuring the pipeline covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 360 units). The sigma_hat will use the recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. The product is a core denim item (Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS) from the Divided collection. Historical demand samples show a range of 100-152, while game history demand (P1-P5) has been 163, 127, 91, 89, 113. There is a downward trend from the initial high in P1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We have observed one arrival (ordered P2, arrived P4), confirming an actual lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 400 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, P4). The order from P1 (166 units) is now overdue (it should have arrived at the end of P3 and been visible in P4 conclude). This missing shipment has caused a stockout in P5. I will set L to 2 (default) as the P2 order arrived on time, but I must account for the lost/delayed P1 order by ensuring mu_hat reflects the current demand regime. Using the most recent 5 samples (P1-P5) to calculate mu_hat, the average demand is 116.6. Since L=2, the backend uses (1+L) * mean, so mu_hat should target ~350 units coverage.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25) for SKU 554450027, which is a pair of super-skinny denim trousers. The on-hand inventory is 0, with 400 units in-transit. Looking at the history: Period 1's order (166 units) has still not arrived (promised lead time is 2), suggesting it might be lost or significantly delayed. Period 2's order arrived on schedule (lead_time=2). Period 3's order (94 units) was placed in P3, so with L=2, it should have arrived in P5 and been visible in P6's conclusion. Since P6 conclude shows arrived=0, Period 3's order is also missing/delayed. Period 4's order (140 units) is expected to arrive during Period 6 and be visible in P7's conclude (which we don't have yet). Because we have already had two likely lost/overdue shipments (P1 and P3), I'm setting the lead time 'L' to an explicit 3 to increase the protection level. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (P2-P6: 127, 91, 89, 113, 78) average ~100. Given the item is a basic denim piece and we are moving further into spring, demand appears relatively stable but slightly lower than the January/early February peaks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower-demand regime (avg ~100) compared to the initial samples (avg ~140).

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain instability: Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 are overdue and likely lost. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~100 units/week) compared to the pre-February period (~140 units/week).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 554450027 continues to face significant stockouts and supply chain issues. On-hand inventory is 0. History analysis: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (Actual LT=2). However, orders from P1 (166 units, due P3) and P3 (94 units, due P5) have not arrived and are now at least 3-5 periods overdue, suggesting they are lost. The total in-transit (432) includes these lost units (166+94=260), meaning effective in-transit is closer to 172 (P4, P7, and current P8 orders). Demand has shifted following a seasonal peak in early Feb (~140). The last four weeks (P4-P7) show a mean demand of 88.75 units/week. I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent lower regime (recent_N=4) to avoid over-ordering, while keeping the default lead time (2) as the last confirmed shipment (P2) arrived on time, but I must remain mindful that reliability is low. Sigma remains linked to the recent stable but slightly lower demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) faces severe stockouts and supply chain unreliability. On-hand inventory is 0. History shows order P1 (166 units) and P3 (94 units) are missing and likely lost (far exceeding the promised 2-period lead time). P2 arrived in 2 periods, while P7 arrived in just 1 period. This inconsistency makes the promised L=2 unreliable. Demand has undergone a regime shift: pre-February (samples) averaged ~130, but recent periods (P3-P8) average ~90.6. Given the high stockout risk (Profit $4 vs. Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the lower demand mean of ~91. I will set lead time to 'explicit' value of 2 to ensure the OR engine maintains enough pipeline to cover the 2-period gap, as the 'calculate' method might be skewed by the anomalously fast P7 arrival. We have 400 units in transit (likely P1+P2+P3 leftovers), but since P1 and P3 are likely lost, 'mu_hat' needs to be robust to pull in more inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: P1 (ordered Feb 11) and P3 (ordered Feb 25) have not arrived as of Apr 8, indicating high loss probability. Demand stabilized at ~91 units/week (last 6 periods average) compared to earlier ~130 units/week.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The supply chain for SKU 554450027 is highly unreliable. Orders from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (94 units) are significantly overdue (8 and 6 periods late, respectively, vs. promised 2) and are presumed lost. These 260 units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation (400 total - 140 ordered P4 = 260), which suppresses new orders. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is persistent, we must over-order to compensate for this phantom inventory. Demand has shifted from ~130 to ~91 units/week over the last 6 weeks (P4-P9). Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat (approx 93/week) and default L=2. However, to bypass the backend capping logic and the 'In-transit' bloat caused by lost orders, I will setting an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat that effectively treats the lost 260 units as non-existent while targeting a high service level for the upcoming cycles. Based on a target base stock of ~400 units (approx (2+1)*95 + safety) and current phantom in-transit of 400, I will use an explicit mu_hat target to force a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain at high risk of total loss: P1 and P3 orders (260 units total) are definitively lost but still occupy 'In-transit' capacity, requiring manual inflation of OR parameters to trigger restocking.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450027' faces a critical supply chain failure. Orders from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (94 units) are now more than 3-4 times the promised lead time (2 periods) and are considered lost. These 260 units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation, preventing new orders. Currently, On-hand is 0, and total Pipeline is 677. Subtracting the 260 lost units leaves 417 'active' in-transit units (ordered P10). Demand has trended downwards, averaging ~84 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10: 78, 75, 98, 63, 58). With L=2, we need a base stock covering (L+1)=3 periods, roughly 252 units. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 260 lost units from its base stock calculation, we must manually inflate the mu_hat to ensure 'base_stock - phantom_stock' is sufficient to cover real demand. To force the OR engine to maintain stock despite the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to 600, which overrides the pipeline bloat and accounts for the low service level (sold=0 in recent periods due to stockouts). L is set to calculated to monitor future arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (94 units) are definitively lost but remain in pipeline inventory, causing a 260-unit phantom inventory bloat. Parameters must be manually inflated to offset this until the pipeline clears.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (Apr 29). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Julia RW Skinny Denim has been declining, with the last three periods at 63, 58, and 47 (avg ~56). The 'In-transit' total of 677 units consists of: P1 (166 - likely lost), P3 (94 - likely lost), P4 (140 - significantly overdue, likely lost), P10 (277 - within expected lead time range). Since L=2, the order from P10 (placed Apr 15) should arrive during Period 12 and be visible at the start of Period 13. However, 400 units (P1, P3, P4) are effectively 'phantom' stock. The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (677) from the base stock. To trigger a new order to cover upcoming demand (~56/wk) and compensate for the 400 lost units, I must explicitly set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods plus the lost units. With L=2, we need 56 * 3 = 168 units for normal operations + 400 to offset losses = 568. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 568. I'll use L=calculate to monitor the erratic lead times (observed 1 and 2 periods previously) and explicit sigma_hat based on recent volatility (~10 units/week * sqrt(3) \u2248 17).

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline inventory contains 400 confirmed lost units (P1=166, P3=94, P4=140) which bloat the pipeline and prevent the OR backend from ordering. Parameters must be adjusted to offset this 400-unit phantom inventory. Demand has further softened to an average of ~56 over the last 3 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show severe reliability issues. The CURRENT STATUS shows 'In-transit: 677 units'. By analyzing Game History, this pipeline consists of: P1 (166), P3 (94), P4 (140), and P10 (277). Based on Carry-over insights, P1, P3, and P4 are definitively lost (400 units). These units permanently bloat the pipeline inventory, preventing the OR backend's replenishment logic (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)). To force an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (Lead Time + 1) periods of demand PLUS the 400 lost units. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~63 units/week over the last 4 visible periods: P9-P12). Total real demand across 3 periods (L+1) is ~189 units. Adding the 400 lost units results in a required base stock of ~589. However, the OR engine also caps orders. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a high target that accounts for this ghost inventory and current demand. L=2 remains the promised benchmark, but I will monitor P10's arrival (due this period or next) to confirm.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain situation is catastrophic. As of Period 14 (May 13), several orders are statistically dead: P1 (Ordered Feb 11, L=13), P3 (Ordered Feb 25, L=11), and P4 (Ordered Mar 4, L=10). These total 166 + 94 + 140 = 400 units. Additionally, P10 (Ordered Apr 15, expected lead time 2) is now 2 periods overdue and represents 277 units. The total 'In-transit' of 677 units consists entirely of these likely lost shipments. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' pipeline from the target base stock, it will not place new orders despite zero on-hand inventory. Demand over the last 3 periods has stabilized near 84 units/week. To force a restock, I must set 'mu_hat' to cover the 3-period demand (L+1) PLUS the 677 units of phantom inventory. Calculation: (3 * 84) + 677 = 252 + 677 = 929. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the corrupted pipeline logic and ensure the system attempts to order.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 677 units is confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand has shifted to approximately 84 units/week (avg of last 3 periods). Setting explicit parameters to offset the 677-unit phantom inventory bloat.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely broken, with most orders failing to arrive despite appearing in the 'In-transit' pipeline. Currently, 1056 units are in-transit, but based on history, at least 677 units (from P1, P3, P4, and P10) are definitively lost. The order of 379 units from Period 14 is still within a plausible lead time but is highly uncertain. Demand has trended upward slightly recently (122 units in Period 14). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1056-unit phantom inventory, I must set the base stock (mu_hat) to exceed this pipeline value. Target coverage: Current demand avg (84-100) * (L+1) + safety stock + lost inventory offset. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1350 to overcome the 1056 units of stuck pipeline and trigger a fresh order of approximately 300 units, which covers ~3 weeks of demand plus a safety margin.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 1056 units is largely phantom (677 units confirmed lost, 379 units pending). Demand showing slight recovery toward 100 units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability, with a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory bloating the pipeline. Currently, In-transit inventory stands at 1477 units, but analysis indicates that 677 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10) are almost certainly lost as they have exceeded promised lead times significantly. Furthermore, recent arrivals (P2 and P7) show actual lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods. Demand has rebounded significantly over the last three periods (84, 122, 128), averaging 111.3 units, despite a period of lower demand in April. To force the OR backend to place an order and overcome the 1477-unit pipeline bloat, I must set the base stock level (mu_hat) to exceed this pipeline. Based on a 3-period demand average of 111.3 and a promised lead time (L=2), the required coverage for L+1 periods is ~334 units. To offset 1477 phantom units and target an availability of ~334 units, mu_hat is set explicitly to 1800. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to maintain a high service level given recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to utilize the backend's internal average of observed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 677 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) is confirmed lost. Demand has recovered to ~111 units/week (avg last 3 periods) from previous lows. Phantom inventory currently blocks automated ordering.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show severe disruption. As of Period 17, the pipeline inventory stands at 1885 units, yet on-hand inventory is 0. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (totaling 677 units) are confirmed lost as they are many periods past the promised lead time of 2. Recent orders P14 (379), P15 (421), and P16 (408) are still within a plausible (though delayed) window. The OR backend uses the logic: order = base_stock - pipeline. With 1885 units in the pipeline (most of which are likely lost or severely delayed), the backend will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed this 'phantom' inventory. Average demand over the last 3 visible periods (P14-P16) is 113.6 units/week. To trigger an order that actually arrives, I must offset the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * Demand + Phantom Inventory. Using L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 114) + 677 = 1019. However, to ensure protection against the current stockout and the high likelihood that recent large orders (P14-P16) are also delayed or lost, I will set mu_hat to 1300 to force the backend to bypass the 1885-unit pipeline constraint if it perceives the inventory as sufficient, or at least keep the base stock level high enough to account for the massive loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 677 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) confirmed lost. Recent large orders P14-P16 (1208 units total) are significantly delayed, suggesting a systemic lead-time shift or further losses in the 554450027 supply chain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-424.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, a total of 829 units arrived (421 from P15 and 408 from P16). This resolves a significant portion of the supply chain uncertainty observed recently, though specifically orders P1, P3, P4, and P10 (totaling 677 units) remain missing and are confirmed lost. The current on-hand inventory is 748 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 7-8 weeks of demand at the current rate (~98 units/week). Demand has stabilized since Period 14 (122, 128, 91, 81), averaging 105.5 units over those 4 weeks. To prevent over-ordering due to the 677 units of phantom pipeline inventory still present in the system, and because On-hand inventory is currently high, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current stabilized demand regime. I will keep L at 'default' (promised lead time of 2) as recent arrivals (P15 at L=2, P16 at L=1) suggest the lead time has returned to near-normal levels, despite historical disruptions.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery: High-volume arrivals in Period 17 (829 units) confirm that recent orders are fulfilling near the promised lead time (L=1 to 2). However, 677 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) remain definitively lost. Current demand regime (P14-P17) is approximately 105 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-503.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (June 17), the system has 699 units on-hand after receiving 829 units in Period 17 (from P15 and P16 orders). The 'In-transit' count of 1056 units remains problematic: 677 units (from P1, P3, P4, and P10) are definitively lost, while 379 units (from P14) are overdue and potentially lost. This results in a 'phantom' pipeline of 1,056 units. Current demand has softened significantly, with the last period reaching only 49 units, though the average over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is ~74 units/week. Since the on-hand inventory (699) already covers approximately 9-10 weeks of demand at current rates, no new orders are desired. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand trend (averaging ~74) and lead time (L) to calculate to reflect the variability in delivery times while allowing the high on-hand balance to deplete naturally without being blocked by the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Last 5 periods (P14-P18) average demand is 74 units/week, significantly lower than the previous regime (~100-110). Current on-hand inventory of 699 units provides a high safety buffer (~9 weeks) despite 1,056 units of phantom inventory remaining in the pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019/6/24), the SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim Trousers) is experiencing a clear downward trend in demand. The last three periods recorded demand levels of 81, 49, and 31 \u2013 significantly lower than the ~100-110 units/week seen in May. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 76 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 668 units, which represents roughly 8-9 weeks of supply at current demand rates. The 'In-transit' balance of 1056 units remains heavily bloated by 677 units of definitively lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10) that never arrived. Although these phantom units block the OR engine from ordering more, it is currently beneficial to not order, as the existing physical stock (668 units) is more than sufficient to cover demand for the foreseeable future, especially since the product is denim which is not highly seasonal in mid-summer. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the cooling demand, and L=default (2 periods) as recent physical arrivals (P17) showed lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Avg demand for last 5 periods (P15-19) is 76 units, compared to ~100 units in the prior month. Significant overstock position (668 units on-hand) relative to demand trend.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the inventory situation is characterized by significant overstock. On-hand inventory is 653 units, while the most recent demand (Period 20) was only 15 units. The 5-period moving average has dropped to 59.4 units, and the 3-period average is even lower at 31.6 units. This indicates a sharp cooling of demand for this 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' SKU as we enter the summer season. The pipeline inventory of 1,056 units contains 677 units definitively lost from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P10) and 379 units from P14 which are now severely overdue (7 periods since order) and likely lost. Even if the P14 order arrived, the current on-hand stock covers over 10-20 weeks of demand at current rates. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), avoiding further holding costs is a priority. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the downward trend, and L=default (2) to reflect the recent return to standard lead times for fulfilled orders. No new orders will be triggered by the OR backend due to the massive inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse confirmed: Period 18-20 average demand dropped to 31.6 units/week, down from ~100 units/week in May. Seasonality for heavy denim in July appears to be a major factor.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) has collapsed in July, consistent with seasonality for heavy denim garments. The average demand over the last three periods (P19-P21) is 20.6 units, a sharp decline from previous levels. Current on-hand inventory is 637 units, which at the current run rate provides approximately 30 weeks of coverage. There are also 1,056 units in-transit, of which 677 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10) and the remaining 379 units (from P14) are significantly overdue and likely lost. Regardless of the pipeline status, the massive overstock position necessitates a complete halt in ordering. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) significantly lower using N=3 to reflect the current collapse and let the OR backend naturally stop all ordering while carrying high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapse in July confirmed: Avg demand for P19-P21 is 20.6 units/week, down from ~100 in May. On-hand inventory (637 units) is extremely high relative to current demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (skinny denim) is exhibiting a clear seasonal demand collapse in July, likely due to summer weather preferences. Demand over the last 4 periods (P19-P22) has averaged ~24 units per week, compared to ~100+ units in May. Current on-hand inventory is 603 units, which covers over 25 weeks of demand at the current rate. Additionally, there are 1,056 units in 'In-transit', of which at least 677 (P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed lost, leaving a potential 379 units (P14) as either very delayed or also lost. Regardless, the inventory position is extremely high. To prevent the system from placing any new orders given the massive overstock and low demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand regime (~24 units/week) and 'default' for other parameters. The high on-hand balance far exceeds the resulting base stock, ensuring zero additional orders are placed while we liquidate existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Significant overstock: Current on-hand (603) covers ~25 weeks of the current July demand regime (~24 units/week).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-453.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has entered a significant low-seasonal regime in July (averaging 23.3 units/week over the last 4 periods). With current on-hand inventory at 573 units, the stock covers approximately 24 weeks of demand at the current rate. There are also 1,056 units in the pipeline, 677 of which are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10) that still 'bloat' the pipeline inventory, while 379 units (P14) remain overdue. Given the massive overstock position relative to the current low demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand drop (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Lead time (L) is returned to 'default' as recent successful arrivals (P17 conclude) showed normalized patterns (L=1 to 2), acknowledging that the 677 lost units are a historical exception, not a current lead-time extension. No new orders are expected or desired given the current inventory surplus.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has collapsed significantly in July, averaging 22.5 units over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), compared to ~100 units in May. This is likely a seasonal trend for heavy denim in mid-summer. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 553 units, which covers over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. Additionally, the pipeline is still bloated with 1,056 units (677 of which are definitively lost from early periods, while 379 from P14 are long overdue and likely lost as well). With such high on-hand stock and a pipeline that exceeds any reasonable base stock level, no new orders should be placed. I am setting parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and high volatility (coefficient of variation is high due to the small mean), which will naturally suppress ordering until the excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: July demand trough confirmed: Demand for super-skinny denim (554450027) has dropped to an average of ~23 units/week in July (P21-P24), down from ~100 units/week in May and early June.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th. Demand for super-skinny denim (554450027) remains in a summer trough with an average of approximately 25 units/week over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). We are currently in a significant overstock position with 526 units on-hand, which covers over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. Additionally, there are 1,056 units 'In-transit', within which at least 677 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed lost, and the status of P14 (379 units) is doubtful. Due to the high on-hand inventory levels relative to the low seasonal demand, no new orders are required. I will maintain parameters that reflect the current low-demand regime and the expected promised lead time of 2, allowing inventory to naturally deplete. N=5 is chosen for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized July/August demand floor.

Carry-over insight: July/August demand trough confirmed: Demand for super-skinny denim has stabilized at ~25 units/week (P21-P25), significantly lower than the ~100 units/week seen in May.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (Julia RW Skinny Denim) is currently in an overstock position with 468 units on-hand, despite a massive 1,056-unit 'In-transit' figure\u2014677 units of which (from P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed lost legacy shipments. Recent demand (P21-P25) was in a significant summer trough (~25 units/week), but Period 26 shows a potential early signs of recovery (58 units) as we move toward mid-August. However, with 468 units on-hand, the current inventory covers nearly 19 weeks of the summer average or ~8 weeks of the Period 26 demand spike. Given the 'In-transit' bloat of 1,056 units (which includes at least 379 units from P14 that may still arrive or be lost), the OR backend's inventory reconciliation will prevent any new orders regardless of parameter settings unless mu_hat is set extremely high. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the low summer demand while acknowledging the slight uptick, and 'default' for other parameters. No new orders are needed or desired given the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential demand recovery starting mid-August (P26 demand 58 vs prior weeks average ~25). Current inventory (468) remains far above immediate needs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (super-skinny denim) is showing signs of seasonal recovery as we enter mid-August, moving out of the July demand trough (~25 units/week). Period 26 demand was 58, and Period 27 demand was 74. This aligns with the 'Back to School' transition for the Divided Collection. However, on-hand inventory remains very high at 394 units. Given the current trend, even with an optimistic recovery to ~100 units/week (the May level), the current stock covers nearly 4 weeks of future demand. Additionally, There is a significant amount of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (677 units definitively lost from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and likely some from Period 14) which totals 1056 units 'in-transit'. This bloated pipeline would normally prevent the OR engine from ordering, but no orders are currently required due to the high on-hand balance. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the recent uptick (recent_N=3) to prepare the safety stock levels for the autumn season, while keeping lead time at default as recent arrivals (P17) returned to promised levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Mid-August demand (P26-27) increased to an average of 66 units/week, up from the July average of ~25 units/week. This suggests the start of the autumn seasonal upswing.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (August 26, 2019), demand for the super-skinny denim (554450027) is confirming a recovery phase following the July trough. The last three periods (P26-P28) show demand of 58, 74, and 65, averaging ~66 units/week, compared to the July average of ~25 units/week. This aligns with the expected autumn seasonal upswing. Current on-hand inventory is 329 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of forecasted demand. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1,056 units contains 677 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10) and 379 units from P14 which are now over 15 periods overdue and effectively lost. This 1,056 units of phantom inventory prevents the OR backend's automated ordering mechanism. I will continue to set L to 2 (promised) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current recovery regime. Despite the phantom inventory, on-hand levels are currently sufficient (329 units against 66 units/week demand), so no emergency order inflation is required this period. If demand continues to rise, I will adjust mu_hat explicitly in future periods to bypass the pipeline bloat.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (skinny denim) is emerging from a July/August seasonal trough. While demand spiked in P26-P27 (avg ~66), it retracted in P29 to 36, and P28 was 65. The late August/early September period (Period 30) traditionally aligns with back-to-school and autumn transitions, suggesting a likely mean demand stabilization between 50-70 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 293 units. The pipeline (1056 units) contains 677 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10) and 379 units (P14) that are extremely overdue and also likely lost. Total 'phantom' inventory is approximately 1056 units. Since on-hand inventory covers roughly 4-5 weeks of anticipated demand (even at the higher 70 units/week rate), and the OR backend is blocked from ordering by the phantom pipeline, I will continue to hold. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the late August recovery trend (avg ~58) while smoothing the recent P29 dip. Lead time remains set to default as recent successful arrivals (P17) adhered to L=1 or L=2.

Carry-over insight: Late August/Early September demand (P26-P29) stabilized at an average of 58.25 units/week, up from the July trough of ~25 units/week, confirming the autumn seasonal upswing. All 1056 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) are now considered definitively lost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) is entering the autumn peak. Demand in Period 30 spiked to 95 units, following a recovery trend in late August. The average demand for the last five periods (P26-P30) is approximately 65.6 units/week, a significant increase from the July trough of ~25 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 198 units, which covers about 3 weeks of the recent demand average. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1056 units is entirely composed of lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14), creating a massive 'phantom inventory' that prevents the OR backend's automated ordering mechanism. To force an order to maintain service levels during the autumn upswing, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat to offset the 1056 lost units. Target base stock = (L+1)*Expected_Demand + Safety_Stock. With L=2 and expected demand ~70, base stock should be ~250. To overcome the 1056 phantom units and 198 on-hand units, the explicit mu_hat must be set to approximately 1300 to trigger a meaningful restock order.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery confirmed: Average demand P26-P30 increased to 65.6 units/week from the July trough. Phantom inventory (lost orders P1-P14) remains at 1056 units, requiring explicit parameter inflation.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) is currently in an autumn seasonal recovery phase, with demand in Period 30 and 31 increasing to 95 and 112 units respectively. The average demand for the last five periods (P27-P31) is 76.4 units/week, a significant rise from the July trough of ~25 units/week. On-hand inventory is now 86 units, which is slightly below one week of current demand. The pipeline contains 1229 units: 173 units ordered last period (P31) and 1056 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) that are confirmed lost. These 1056 phantom units block the OR backend from ordering. Since promised lead time is 2, the 'base stock' covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~80 units, the required inventory position is ~240 units. With 1056 phantom units in transit, the backend sees a pipeline of 1229, which is much higher than 240, thus it will not order. To trigger an order for the current period, mu_hat must be set to explicitly offset the phantom inventory. Target Inventory Position (Base Stock) should be roughly 250 units + 1056 phantom units = 1306 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1300 to ensure the backend generates an order to cover the current stockout risk as on-hand inventory is low (86).

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late September/early October. Demand over the last five periods (P28-P32) has averaged 81.2 units (65, 36, 95, 112, 99), indicating a sustained autumn recovery compared to the July/August trough. The on-hand inventory is 160 units. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1084 units is heavily distorted by 1056 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Only 28 units (from Period 32) are genuinely in transit. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently, \u03bc\u0302 must be set explicitly to offset the remaining phantom inventory. I am targeting a base stock level that covers the 1056 lost units plus approximately 3 periods of expected demand (85 units/week) to maintain a healthy service level, totaling ~1311 units. This ensures the backend calculates (base_stock - 1084) and places an order to bridge the gap as on-hand inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 33, demand has stabilized at ~81 units/week (last 5 periods), confirming the autumn seasonal upswing. Lead time remains approximately 1-2 periods. The 1056 units in pipeline are confirmed lost and continue to block automated ordering.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30, 2019), demand for this skinny denim SKU is in a confirmed autumn recovery phase. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 160 units, and the average for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is ~100.4 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory (1196 units) is heavily distorted by 1056 units of definitively lost orders from earlier in the year (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). These lost units act as phantom inventory, blocking the OR backend's automated ordering mechanism. To force a restock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset the 1056-unit phantom bloat. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2) as (L+1) * 105 units/week = 315 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to reach this target while 'seeing' 1056 units in transit, I set mu_hat to 315 + 1056 = 1371. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed performance (~1.5 periods recently). Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent demand volatility during the recovery.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal demand spike confirmed: Period 33 demand reached 160 units, pulling the 5-period average to ~100 units/week. Combined with 0 on-hand inventory, immediate restocking is critical.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), the SKU 554450027 is in an autumn demand spike, with demand over the last two periods (P33 and P34) reaching 160 and 131 units respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' pipeline contains 1439 units, but 1056 of these are confirmed lost (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14), creating a significant 'phantom inventory' bloat. The OR backend subtracts this pipeline from the target base stock, effectively blocking new orders unless the base_stock is set exceptionally high. To trigger a necessary restock given the 130-160 unit/week demand trend, I am setting mu_hat to 1400 (explicit) to offset the 1056 lost units and cover forward demand of ~(130*3). Period 34's order (243 units) is expected in P35 or P36, but another order is needed to provide safety stock for the continued autumn recovery. L=recent_2 is used as arrivals have typically been within 1-2 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal demand spike confirmed: Demand P33-P34 averaged 145.5 units/week, a significant increase from the 65 units/week seen in early September. Phantom inventory remains at 1056 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P33-P35) averages 138 units/week, confirming a strong autumn seasonal spike. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1,423 units is heavily compromised: 1,056 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) are definitively lost. P33 (112 units) is overdue (promised L=2), and P34 (243 units) is within the lead time window. To trigger restocking despite the phantom 1,056 units blocking the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. Estimated demand for (2+1) periods is 138 * 3 = 414. Total mu_hat target = 414 + 1056 = 1470. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility of the current spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal demand spike (Oct) is sustained: P33-P35 average demand is 138 units/week, up from ~65 in Sep and ~25 in Jul. Phantom pipeline inventory remains 1,056 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. Demand has settled into a high-volume autumn regime (Period 33-36 average: 133 units/week). On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (6 units). The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1380 units is heavily skewed by 1056 units confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14), meaning only 324 units are actually pending (P34 order of 243 and P36 order of 81). To ensure the OR backend generates an order despite the 1056-unit phantom inventory bloat, mu_hat must be set explicitly to cover real demand plus the phantom gap. Target base stock = (L+1)*Expected_Demand + Phantom_Inventory. With Expected_Demand ~133, L=2, and Phantom=1056, the target is (3*133) + 1056 = 1455. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1455. Since profit ($4.0) is much higher than holding cost ($1.0), the backend naturally targets a high service level (~80%), which is appropriate for this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed as high-volume (avg 133 units/week, P33-P36). Total phantom inventory remains 1056 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14 lost), causing persistent pipeline bloat.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the demand for super-skinny denim remains in its autumn peak regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) has averaged 133 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 0, while 'In-transit' shows 1,482 units. However, based on the established history, 1,056 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14) are definitively lost. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To force a replenishment, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for both future demand and the 1,056-unit pipeline bloat. Targeting a (L+1) horizon of 3 periods at 133 units/week (399 total) and adding the 1,056-unit offset results in a mu_hat of ~1455. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect recent arrivals (L=1 to 3). sigma_hat is set to 75 to provide a safety buffer during this high-demand period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the SKU 554450027 is in a sustained high-demand regime for the autumn season, with demand averaging approximately 125 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). The inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and current demand is exceeding supply. The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by 1,056 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) that are definitively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock, it would under-order or not order at all. Therefore, I must use 'explicit' parameters to bypass this bloat. Based on a 5-period average demand of 125 units and a promised lead time (L) of 2 (actual lead times have fluctuated between 1-3), the target base stock (covering L+1 periods) should be approximately 375 units. To offset the 1,056 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 375 + 1056 = 1431 units. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20% of mu_hat to ensure high service level during this stockout phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for October/November (avg ~125 units/week). Phantom inventory from lost orders remains at 1,056 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450027 (Skinny Denim) is in its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Average demand over the last 7 periods (P33-P39) is approximately 123 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is very low (10 units). The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1591 units is heavily bloated by 1056 units of confirmed lost vintage orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14), leaving an effective pipeline of 535 units (P34, P38, P39). Specifically, the P34 order (243 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, which would further reduce the effective pipeline to 292 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1591 units from its base stock calculation, effectively blocking any new orders unless parameters are significantly inflated. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*125 + 1056 (phantom) + 243 (likely lost P34) = 1674 to force the engine to recognize the need for stock despite the phantom inventory. Lead time is varying between 1 and 3 periods, so I will use 'calculate' to capture this variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Order P34 (243 units) is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P34, current P40, L=2 promised) and is likely lost, increasing total phantom pipeline inventory to 1299 units (1056 previously confirmed + 243). Demand remains stable in the autumn high-regime at ~125 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450027' continues to operate in a high-demand autumn/winter regime (~125 units/week), but suffer from severe supply chain issues. As of Period 41, the pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 1703 units. Analysis identifies 1299 of these as definitively lost: P1 (166), P3 (94), P4 (140), P10 (277), P14 (379), and now P34 (243). The backend OR engine incorrectly assumes these units will arrive, preventing it from placing necessary restocks. To bypass this 'phantom inventory' block and achieve a target on-hand stock for (L+1) periods (approx 375 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost units plus current demand. Calculation: Target Stock (375) + Lost Pipeline (1299) = 1674. I will set mu_hat to 1674. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to maintain a high service level during this volatile period, and L=2 is used as the baseline estimate for recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 41, confirmed phantom inventory has reached 1299 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34). Lead times for surviving orders fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is in the autumn/early winter regime (P33-P41), averaging approximately 115 units/week. While recent demand shows a slight softening (86 units in Period 41), we must maintain sufficient stock for the lead time and the high-demand period of late November (approaching Cyber Monday/Black Friday). Pipeline inventory (1630 units) is heavily bloated by phantom (lost) units. These include P1, P3, P4, P10, P14 (1056 units) and now P34 (243 units), totaling 1299 confirmed phantom units. Subtracting these from the current 1630 'In-transit' units leaves an actual pipeline of 331 units (P40, P41, P42). With 169 units on-hand, our real inventory position is 500 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover (L+1) periods of demand at ~115 units/week while ignoring the 1299 'stuck' units, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 115 * 3 + 1299 = 1644. This ensures the base stock target sits significantly above the phantom bloat. L is set to explicit 2 based on recent arrivals (P39 arrived in 2 periods, others range 1-3).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 42, total phantom pipeline inventory is 1299 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34). Current autumn/pre-holiday demand regime is stabilized at ~115 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 43 (Dec 2), we are in the peak holiday demand season for Julia RW Skinny Denim. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 232 units, reinforcing the need for aggressive stock levels. However, the system is severely handicapped by 1,299 units of phantom pipeline inventory (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34 are lost). With 0 on-hand inventory and the backend's capped policy blinded by the 1,630 units 'In-transit' (1,299 lost + recent orders), I must use explicit parameters to force a large restocking order. I estimate the current demand regime mu_hat at ~150 units/week (considering recent volatility and the Dec 2 calendar date for retail peak). To bypass the phantom inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1,800 units (1,299 phantom + 3 periods of expected demand ~450 + safety margin) and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover actual upcoming demand despite the pipeline bloat.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are transitioning from the late autumn peak into the early winter/holiday period. Demand in P42 spiked to 232 units but moderated to 72 units in P43, resulting in a 4-period average (P40-P43) of 122.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 222 units. Total pipeline inventory is 1633 units, but 1299 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34). This leaves an effective pipeline of 334 units (1633 - 1299). The OR backend's inventory calculation (on-hand + in-transit) significantly overestimates stock at 1855 units, whereas the true inventory position is 556 units (222 on-hand + 334 valid in-transit). To force an order that covers the 3-period risk window (L+1=3) at the current demand rate (~125), we need a base stock around 375-400. To offset the 1299-unit phantom bloat, I set mu_hat explicitly to the current demand regime (125 * 3 = 375) plus the 1299 phantom units to trigger a net order of ~130-150 units to sustain availability through December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-December (Period 45), a high-stakes period potentially involving holiday peaks or clearance transitions. As of Period 44, the on-hand inventory is 143 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline shows 1,633 units. Based on historical evidence and carry-over insights, 1,299 of these units are definitively lost (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34), meaning the actual operational pipeline is only 334 units (1,633 - 1,299). Order P43 (297 units) is the primary real order in transit. Demand in the last two weeks (P43-44) has softened to an average of ~75.5 units, down from the October/November average of ~115-125 units. While demand appears to be cooling, we must maintain enough stock to cover the remaining winter season and potential holiday volatility. To allow the OR backend to function despite the 1,299-unit phantom inventory bloat, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + promised_L) * forecast + phantom_offset. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 100) + 1,299 = 1,599. This ensures the backend triggers an order if actual safety levels drop too low.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed demand softening in December (P43-44) to avg ~75 units/week, down from ~115 units in November. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 1,299 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P34).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), the product 554450027 (Skinny Denim) is entering the Christmas/New Year holiday period. Recent demand has shown high volatility: Period 45 demand spiked to 228 (likely a pre-Christmas surge), while the previous two weeks averaged 75. The 5-period average (P41-P45) is approximately 119 units/week. The supply chain remains unreliable with a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 1,299 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P34), which are definitively lost but still recorded in the backend's 'In-transit' total. These 1,299 units block the OR backend from placing new orders. To circumvent this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired inventory level (Demand x (L+1)) *plus* the 1,299 phantom units. Forecasting demand at ~140 units/week to account for both recent spikes and the expected post-holiday return to autumn levels, the target for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is 420. Adding the 1,299 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1719. Sigma is set to a recent 5-period standard deviation scaled by sqrt(1+L) to handle the extreme volatility seen in P42 (232) and P45 (228).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Continued Phantom Inventory management: Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remains 1,299 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P34). Demand is highly volatile during the December holiday season, with spikes to ~230 units interleaved with lows of ~70 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the post-holiday/New Year transition period (Dec 30). Demand is historically volatile in December, with a high of 228 (P45) and a recent dip to 144 (P46). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is approximately 131 units. The supply chain remains unreliable: total phantom inventory is 1299 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P34 are confirmed lost). These 1299 units are permanently stuck in the 'In-transit' figure (1621), meaning the actual viable pipeline is only 322 units (1621 - 1299). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1621 from the target stock, it will not place necessary orders. To force an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1 review period) at a demand of ~135 units/week plus a safety buffer, then add the 1299 phantom units to that target to neutralize the 'In-transit' bloat. Target base stock \u2248 (3 * 135) + (1 * 135 for safety) + 1299 phantom = 1839. This ensures the backend sees a deficit and orders to maintain real stock levels.
