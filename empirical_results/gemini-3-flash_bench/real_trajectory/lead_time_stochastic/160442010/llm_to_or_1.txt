Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 160442010 (3p Sneaker Socks). The product is a seasonal staple as spring approaches. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values of 84, 54, 56, 70, and 72, with a mean of 67.2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0. Given the stability in recent weeks (Feb 4 demand was 72), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current mean and standard deviation. Since the OR backend uses (1+L) for the coverage period (review + lead time), setting L to 'default' (2) will result in coverage for 3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a staple item likely showing stable demand. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 84, 54, 56, 70, 72. Most recent demand in Period 1 was 81. Mean demand across these 6 points is approx 69.5. On-hand is currently 0 because the Period 1 order (88 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods (expected arrival in Period 3). Since we have no on-hand inventory and just started, I will use all available historical data (N=6) to estimate demand. The lead time L is set to 'default' (2) as we have no evidence yet of deviation. mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. 3 * 69.5 = 208.5. sigma_hat will be based on the standard deviation of recent samples to account for volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a seasonal accessory often seeing demand increases as spring approaches and people switch to lower-profile shoes. Looking at the history, demand spiked significantly from an average of ~67 in Jan/early Feb to 199 in Period 2 (late Feb), suggesting a regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 178 units in transit (88 from P1, 90 from P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since P1's order was placed at the start of P1, it should arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible at the start of P4). Thus, no arrivals are expected to have 'concluded' yet. To address the demand spike (199 in P2), I am using 'recent_N' with N=1 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high demand, as the early historical average of ~67 is now likely too low. This will set a higher base stock to recover from the current stockout and meet elevated spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in late Feb (Period 2): demand increased from ~70 range to 199 (+180%), likely due to spring seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically sees a demand surge as weather warms in March. Historical demand showed a significant regime shift starting in Period 2 (Feb 18th), jumping from an average of ~70 to 199, and then reaching 245 in Period 3. This confirms the carry-over insight of a sustained high-demand regime (+180% to +250% vs early Jan/Feb). Inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have 412 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2, the Period 1 order (88 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, but it did not conclude as arrived in the Period 3 conclude message. This suggests a potential delay or lead time of at least 3 periods. However, per the timing logic, an order placed in Period 1 with lead time 2 arrives *during* Period 3 and is visible in Period 4's decision phase. Since I am at the start of Period 4, the Period 3 conclude message (which I see now) says 'arrived=0'. This confirms the L=2 order from P1 has NOT arrived yet, meaning the actual lead time is > 2. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for this delay. For demand, I'll use the last 2 periods (199, 245) to set \u03bc\u0302, calculating the mean as 222 per period, which for L=3 (4 periods total) equals 888. \u03c3\u0302 is set to accommodate the high volatility observed during this shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for 160442010 is likely 3+ periods (Order from P1 not arrived by end of P3). Demand for sneaker socks is accelerating into March (245 units in P3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/3/11. The product is Sneaker Socks, which is currently in a high-demand seasonal period (approaching Spring). Previous demand spikes (199, 245) confirm this. The P4 demand was 132, but this was likely constrained by starting inventory (90 units), meaning actual demand was higher. Lead time analysis: The P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2), however, the P1 order (placed 2/11) is still missing after 4 periods, suggesting it is lost. Total in-transit is 598 (88+234+276). Since P1 order of 88 is likely lost, effective pipeline is 510. I will set L to 2 (promised) as the P2 order arrived on time, but I will use explicit mu_hat to account for the seasonal acceleration and the lost P1 inventory. Mean demand of the last 3 visible periods (199, 245, 132-adjusted) suggests a forecast of ~220 per period. For mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 3 * 220 = 660.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (88 units) is confirmed lost (exceeded 4 periods with no arrival). Effective pipeline inventory is reduced by 88 units.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product (Sneaker Socks) is entering its core spring/summer season. Historical demand shows a significant increase from ~70 in January/early February to an average of ~170 in recent weeks (199, 245, 132, 136). The P2 order (90 units) arrived in P4, confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods is possible, but the P1 order (88 units) is officially considered lost after 5 periods. The In-transit figure of 822 units includes the 88 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is actually 734 units. On-hand is currently 0, causing stockouts. To maximize profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1), we must maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the seasonal demand regime (avg ~178/period). I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to align with the backend's expected lead time while maintaining the base stock level required for the (L+1) period horizon (3 periods of coverage).

Carry-over insight: P4-P5 demand stabilization: after a spike to 245, the last two periods (132, 136) suggest a new base demand level of ~140-160 for the spring season, adjusting from the initial +180% spike.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late March (Period 7), and the product (Sneaker Socks) is in high seasonal demand (P6 demand spiked to 243). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Reviewing the history: P1 order (88) is lost. P2 order (90) arrived in P4 (L=2). P3 order (234) and P4 order (276) are still in-transit; P3 should have arrived in P5 or P6, suggesting it might be delayed or lost. P5 order (224) arrived very quickly in P6 (L=1). Currently, 510 units are in-transit (P3: 234 + P4: 276). To account for the volatility in lead times and the recent demand spike to 243, I will use an explicit lead time of 2. For demand (mu_hat), the last several weeks (after the initial seasonality shift) show an average around 188 units ((132+136+243)/3). Given the late March timing, demand is likely to remain at this higher level. I'll set mu_hat to (1+L)*190 = 570. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the recent demand swing from 136 to 243.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Highly volatile demand and lead times. P3 order (234 units) is now 2 periods overdue and potentially lost. P6 demand spike (243) confirms that sneaker socks remain in peak spring seasonality.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), we are in the peak spring season for sneaker socks. Current demand is high and volatile (302 in P7, 243 in P6, 136 in P5, 132 in P4). The moving average for the last 4 weeks is ~203 units per week. Previous carry-over insights noted that the P1 order (88 units) was lost and expressed concern about the P3 order (234 units). Looking at the history: P1 (lost), P2 (arrived L=2), P3 (now 5 periods late - likely lost), P4 (in transit), P5 (arrived L=1), P6 (0 ordered), P7 (in transit). Given the P3 order is now 2.5x the promised lead time with no arrival, I will treat it as lost. This reduces reliable pipeline inventory significantly. Demand for early April is forecasted at ~200/week. To ensure the backend places a sufficient order to cover this peak season and account for lead-time instability, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*200 = 600 units, and use a high sigma_hat to handle volatility. I'll stick with the default L since actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 (ignoring losses).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P3 order (234 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods. Demand volatility is extremely high in April, with a recent peak of 302 units; average demand is stabilizing at ~200-210 units per week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU (Sneaker Socks) is in its peak spring season. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has trended upward significantly over the last three weeks (243, 302, 343). The cumulative in-transit inventory is 694, but this includes 234 units from Period 3 which were confirmed lost in previous insights. Removing the lost units, the effective pipeline is 460 units (Ordered P4: 276, Ordered P8: 96, Ordered P9: Pending). Lead times have been erratic: P2 order took 2 periods, while P5 and P7 both took only 1 period. Notably, the P4 order (276 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost as well, further depleting the effective pipeline. Since the backend OR engine is unaware of lost shipments and treats 'In-transit' as a gross number, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand surge (~300 units/week) and use an explicit lead time of 2. For mu_hat, considering (1+L) periods where L=2, I will use (1+2)*300 = 900. For sigma_hat, I will account for high volatility (Std Dev around 80) over 3 periods: sqrt(3)*80 \u2248 140.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 4 order (276 units) confirmed lost after 4 periods of non-arrival. Total lost inventory to date includes P1 (88), P3 (234), and P4 (276). Demand has surged to >300 units/week in April reflecting peak spring seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', currently in peak spring seasonality (mid-April). Demand has been extremely high and volatile, with recent weekly demands of 302, 343, and 208. The average demand over the last four periods is 274 units. We have a severe inventory deficit (on-hand = 0) and a history of lost shipments (P1, P3, and P4 orders are confirmed lost). The 'In-transit' balance of 1127 units includes these lost orders (88 + 234 + 276 = 598 lost units), meaning the true effective pipeline is only 529 units (P8 order 96 and P9 order 433). To recover from these losses and meet peak seasonal demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high-demand April regime. I set L to 'calculate' to incorporate observed lead times (which have varied between 1 and 2 periods for the shipments that did arrive). These parameters will push the OR backend to set a high base stock to cover the seasonal peak and lost pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Cumulative lost shipments for 160442010 now total 598 units (P1, P3, P4). Observed arrivals for P5 and P7 showed lead times of 1 period, suggesting faster delivery for more recent successful orders compared to the promised 2.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item '3p Sneaker Socks' is in peak spring seasonality (late April). Demand has surged significantly, with the last 5 periods showing a mean of approximately 293 units (243, 302, 343, 208, 361), though it is highly volatile. The historical mean from early Feb is no longer relevant. Lead times have stabilized to 1-2 periods for successful deliveries, contrasting with several early lost shipments (P1, P3, P4). The OR engine calculates base stock as (1+L)*demand; I will set L=1 (explicit) to reflect recent successful 1-period arrivals (P6, P8, P10) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~293 units/week. This results in a mu_hat reflecting approximately 586 units for the (1+L) window. Given the high volatility (sigma), recent_N=5 for sigma_hat is also appropriate. I am maintaining a high service level due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~290 units/week for peak April seasonality. Lost shipment total for 160442010 remains at 598 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we are in the peak demand phase for '3p Sneaker Socks'. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has been 302, 343, 208, 361, and 392, averaging 321.2 units per week. This aligns with spring and early summer seasonality when sneaker socks are in high demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' count of 598 units is misleading because it includes 598 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost (as noted in carry-over insights). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent successful shipments (P5, P7, P8, P9) arrived with lead times of 1, 1, 2, and 1 respectively, suggesting an actual lead time shorter than the promised 2. However, to remain conservative against stockouts during this peak season and account for the high volatility (sigma), I will use the recent average for lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use the average of the last 5 periods to capture the current high-demand regime of ~321 units/week. Setting L to calculate allows the OR backend to use the observed lead times from successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~321 units/week for peak seasonal drift (P7-P11). Effective pipeline remains 0 as all 'in-transit' units (598) are historical losses from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are in peak seasonality for sneaker socks. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 1037 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 598 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and never arrived. This leaves an effective pipeline of 439 units (ordered in P12). The lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P7->P8 was 1, P8->P10 was 2, P9->P10 was 1). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average valid observed arrivals. Demand has shown a sustained surge: the last five periods (P8-P12) demand was 343, 208, 361, 392, and 369. The mean of these recent 5 periods is 334.6. Since we are entering May (typically still high season for these socks), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime while filtering out the volatile P8/P9 mix. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~70) during this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at peak levels (~335 units/week) throughout late April and early May. Effective pipeline tracking remains critical as 598 units of the reported 'in-transit' inventory are permanent losses (P1, P3, P4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). We are in the peak demand phase for '3p Sneaker Socks', driven by spring/summer seasonality. Demand over the last 7 periods (P7-P13) has averaged approximately 320 units per week (min 208, max 392). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 1212 units in-transit, but based on carry-over insights, 598 units are historically lost (P1, P3, P4). The actual pipeline consists of orders from P12 (439 units) and P13 (175 units), totaling 614 units. Recent arrivals (P10) showed lead times of 1-2 periods. I will set L to 1 (calculating mean of the most recent successful deliveries) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the current delivery speed. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~320 units/week), and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in April/May demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains high through mid-May (avg ~320/week). Effective pipeline consists only of P12 and P13 orders; cumulative losses (P1, P3, P4) total 598 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4801.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', currently in peak spring/early summer seasonality (late May). Demand remains strong and has stabilized at a high level. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 392, 369, 267, 262, plus the earlier 361) suggests an average mu around 330. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this higher seasonal plateau while smoothing out the variability seen from mid-late April to May. For Lead Time (L), the promised time is 2, but recent actual lead times have varied between 1 and 2 periods (P12 arrived in 2 periods). I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to average these recent arrivals. Regarding inventory, we have 177 on-hand. The system shows 773 in-transit, but 598 units are confirmed lost from early periods (P1, P3, P4). This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 175 units (from the Period 13 order). Since mu_hat is calculated as (1+L)*mean, and L is roughly 2, the base stock target will be around 1000 units. Accounting for the 177 on-hand and 175 legitimate in-transit units, the OR backend should trigger an order of approximately 650 units to maintain the service level for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has remained high and stable throughout May, with recent weekly demands of 267, 262, and 308 (avg ~279). This reflects a slight regression from the absolute April peak of ~335 but maintains a strong late-spring regime. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (P11-P15) to capture this recent plateau (avg ~320/week across L+1 periods). Lead time is set to 2, despite some recent 1-period arrivals, to remain conservative given the history of lost shipments. Regarding inventory, 'In-transit' shows 944 units, but a significant portion (598 units from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed losses. The effective pipeline consists of P13 (175), P15 (171), and any pending units from the current decision. On-hand is 0. My parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, while being mindful that the OR backend treats all 944 in-transit units as viable inventory unless I inflate mu_hat or sigma_hat to compensate for the lost 598 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 current date is June 3rd. Demand for sneaker socks has escalated into a higher regime as spring turns to summer, with recent demand jumping to 383 (P16) from a prior stabilize point around 300. The current trailing 4-period demand average is 330.5. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*335 = 1005 (assuming L=2) to account for this higher seasonal peak. Pipeline analysis: The 'In-transit' quantity is 1127. Subtracting confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 (88), 3 (234), and 4 (276), which total 598 units, leaves an effective pipeline of 529 units (comprised of orders from P13 (175), P15 (171), and P16 (183)). On-hand is 0. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will continue with the default promised lead time of 2 as it safely covers the volatility and ensures the backend computes a sufficient base stock to bridge arrival gaps.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting mid-May: Average demand has shifted from ~300 to ~335 (+12%) reflecting peak summer seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), the product (Womens Sneaker Socks) is in peak summer seasonality. Demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) has averaged approximately 320 units/week, with a recent high of 383 units in Period 16. The carry-over insights confirm that 598 units in the transit pipeline (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, leaving a current effective pipeline of 214 units (P13 order of 175 and P17 order of 39). The P13 order (175 units) is now 5 periods old and is likely lost as well, but I will monitor for one more period before finalizing that conclusion. Lead times for successful recent arrivals (P15, P16) have been 1-2 periods. To maintain a high service level during peak season given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current ~320/week demand regime across the lead time plus review period (1+L).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. This product (3p Sneaker Socks) is in its peak summer seasonality. Demand over the last five periods (P14-P18) has averaged 303 units, with a more recent regime shift detected in P17. Although the mean demand in the last two periods was ~281, the overall trend for the season remains high (~300-335). Regarding inventory: On-hand is 0. Reported In-transit is 971 units. Based on carry-over insights, P1 (88), P3 (234), and P4 (276) were lost (Total 598). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 373 units (P12/P13 arrived; remaining are P17 order (39) and P18 order (159), but these don't sum to 373). Let's re-verify: Total in-transit (971) - Lost (598) = 373 effective in-transit. These 373 units (175 ordered P13, 39 ordered P17, 159 ordered P18) are expected to arrive shortly. Observed lead times recently are 1-2 periods. I will set L to 2 to be safe. For mu_hat, I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand summer regime (avg ~300). For sigma_hat, I use N=5 to reflect current high volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019/6/24). Product 160442010 (Sneaker Socks) is in its peak summer season. Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is listed as 886 units, but history confirms that 598 units are permanent losses (P1: 88, P3: 234, P4: 276). Additionally, the P13 order (175 units) and P17 order (39 units) are significantly overdue (P13 is now 6 periods overdue), suggesting they are also lost. The only viable 'active' pipeline is the P19 order (74 units). Recent demand (P17-P19) averages 288 units/week. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' will include all 886 units (even the losses), I must adjust mu_hat or sigma_hat to force a sufficient order. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 captures the current summer demand level (~290/week). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the highly variable lead times observed (ranging from 1 to 2 periods for successful arrivals). The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will be heavily suppressed by the 886 in-transit units; however, the cap mechanism and mu_hat target should still trigger a replenishment to cover the immediate stockout for this high-margin item ($19 profit vs $1 holding).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Cumulative confirmed losses increased to 812 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). Effective pipeline is currently 74 units (P19). Demand remains high for peak summer seasonality, averaging ~290/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in peak summer seasonality for '3p Sneaker Socks'. Demand is high but stable, averaging approximately 290 units per week over the last five periods (P16-P20). The inventory situation is critical because a large portion of the reported 'In-transit' units (897) are confirmed losses. Losses include: P1(88), P3(234), P4(276), P13(175), and P17(39), totaling 812 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 85 units (P19=74, P20=11). Since current on-hand inventory is 0, we must place a significant order to satisfy peak summer demand. I am setting L to 2 (promised lead time), mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the stable summer demand of ~290/week, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to manage the recent volatility. Because the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes the 812 lost units, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to 'bypass' the under-ordering. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * 290 + 812 = 1682. This ensures the engine calculates a base stock that, when subtracted by the inflated pipeline (897), results in an order sufficient to cover the actual demand and recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed total losses for 160442010 reached 812 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). Summer demand remains stable at ~290 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th, reflecting peak summer seasonality for sneaker socks. However, Period 21 showed a significant demand drop to 198 from a sustained level of ~290-300. This might be a signal of the post-summer peak decline. Inventory management is currently crippled by massive cumulative shipment losses. Confirmed losses to date: P1 (88), P3 (234), P4 (276), P13 (175), P17 (39) = 812 units. Additionally, the order from P19 (74 units) is now 2 periods old, and P20 (11 units) is 1 period old; neither arrived in P21. The OR engine sees 'In-transit' as 1531, but 812 of these are confirmed lost, and several others are highly suspect. To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and ensure the OR engine actually places an order to meet the ~200-300 weekly demand, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate mu_hat as (1+L)*300 = 900 to ensure the policy targets enough stock to overcome the 812 unit 'in-transit' deficit. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative confirmed losses for 160442010 now total 812 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). Period 21 suggests a possible seasonal demand cooling (198 units vs ~290 avg).

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 23 (2019/07/15), we observe a significant demand cooling. Demand in the last two periods (198, 209) is roughly 30% lower than the summer peak (avg ~300). This indicates we have passed the peak seasonality for '3p Sneaker Socks'. We need to reconcile the 'In-transit' quantity of 1520 units. Based on history, orders from P1 (88), P3 (234), P4 (276), P13 (175), and P17 (39) are confirmed lost, totaling 812 units of permanent losses. Period 19 (74) is also overdue and likely lost, bringing the loss estimate to 886. The effective pipeline consists of P21 (634 units) which is expected to arrive shortly. Given the demand drop and the large incoming order (634 units), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the downturn to ~200-230 units/week. L is set to calculated based on recent reliability. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent N to account for the pivot in demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed demand downturn from Summer peak; demand has dropped from ~300 to ~200 units/week (-33%). Cumulative losses for 160442010 now estimated at 886 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3126.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a cooling phase following the peak summer season (June/July). Demand over the last three periods has dropped significantly to 198, 209, and 188 units respectively, establishing a new regime average of approximately 198 units/week. This represents a ~33% decrease from the previous ~300 units/week peak. The lead time remains consistent with the promised 2 periods (P21 order arrived in P23). Current on-hand inventory is 446 units. Regarding the 'In-transit' figure of 886 units, historical analysis confirms these are all lost shipments (P1: 88, P3: 234, P4: 276, P13: 175, P17: 39, P19: 74). Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0. With on-hand inventory (446) currently exceeding approximately 2.25 weeks of recent demand (approx 200/week), and the OR engine targeting a (L+1)=3 week stock level, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower demand level while maintaining a buffer. The high on-hand balance relative to new demand will naturally lead the OR backend to produce small or zero orders to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand downturn from Summer peak; demand has stabilized at ~200 units/week over the last 3 periods (P21-P23). Total accumulated lost shipments for 160442010 now equal the reported 'In-transit' value of 886 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1734.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. Demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-summer cooldown phase. The demand in Period 24 was significantly lower at 109 units, following a stabilization around 200 units (P21-P23). This reflects a marked shift from the peak summer regime of ~290-335 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward trend (averaging the drop from 198 to 109). Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' of 886 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 88, P3: 234, P4: 276, P13: 175, P17: 39, P19: 74; total 886). Thus, the effective pipeline is zero. With 337 units on-hand and current demand averaging ~175/week, the inventory level is sufficient to cover the next 1-2 periods. I am setting L to the promised lead time of 2 as recent successful deliveries (P20, P21) arrived in 2 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated on the last 4 periods to account for the increased volatility during this cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand cooling confirmed; late-July demand dropped to 109 units, bringing the 4-period average down to ~175 units/week. Effective pipeline is zero as all 886 in-transit units are confirmed lost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which has shown a clear seasonal lifecycle in 2019. Demand peaked in April/May (~335/week) and has been steadily cooling since mid-July. Last 5 periods of demand are: 198, 209, 188, 109, 121. This confirms a transition from peak summer seasonality to a late-summer/autumn baseline. The current 3-period average is ~139 units. Pipeline analysis: The 'In-transit' of 886 units entirely matches the cumulative confirmed losses (Period 24/25 insights: P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19 are lost). Therefore, effective pipeline is zero. On-hand is 216 units, which is sufficient for approximately 1.5 periods of the current demand level. To prevent a stockout while respecting the cooling trend, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent mean of ~156 units. L is set to 'calculate' to use historical actuals, which have stabilized around 1-2 periods for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late-July/early-August: demand declined from ~200 to ~115 (-42%) as summer peak concludes. Pipeline remains compromised: all 886 units currently 'in-transit' are confirmed losses.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-summer/early-autumn cooling phase. After peaking at ~335 units/week in May/June, demand has shifted significantly downward. Over the last four periods (P23-P26), demand has averaged 137 units per week (188, 109, 121, 131). This confirms the regime shift identified in the carry-over insights. Total 'In-transit' inventory (886 units) is entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 85 units. With the current demand rate of ~137 and a lead time of 2, the 'inventory position' (85 on-hand + 0 effective in-transit) is below the level needed to cover the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 3 periods). Therefore, I will set mu_hat to 135 units per week using recent_N=4 to reflect this lower regime and ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order that ignores the dead 'in-transit' volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at ~130-140 units/week for August transition (P24-P26 average: 120 units). All 886 units in-transit are confirmed historical losses, meaning the effective pipeline is 0.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a lower, stable regime following the summer peak. For the period P24-P27, demand has averaged 114 units/week (109, 121, 131, 95). We detect a significant downshift from the previous summer average of ~300. The current 'In-transit' of 886 units consists entirely of historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning effective pipeline inventory is zero. Since ending on-hand inventory is 0 after P27, we must resume ordering to meet the new demand level. I will use a 4-period window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized late-summer demand of ~114 units/week. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P20, P21) have adhered to the promised 2-period window, despite the high frequency of lost shipments earlier in the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for late August at ~115 units/week (P24-P27 average). Total historical shipment losses remain at 886 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-summer/early-autumn cooling phase. After peaking at over 300 units/week, demand has steadily declined. The last five periods show demand of 109, 121, 131, 95, and 80. The 3-period average is approximately 102 units/week, and the 5-period average is 107 units/week. I will set mu_hat to reflect this lower regime using recent_N=5. The lead time has remained consistently around 1-2 periods for successful arrivals, and the reported 'In-transit' of 886 units is confirmed to be composed entirely of lost shipments from periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, and 19. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is zero. Since on-hand is currently zero, the OR backend needs to place a replenishment order based on this lower demand forecast to prevent stockouts while avoiding overstocking in a declining market.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Late August demand (P27-P28) has dropped to ~85-95 units/week, suggesting the conclusion of summer peak seasonality.

Over the last 6 periods (P24-P29), demand has consistently trended downwards from ~110 to ~85 units, with an average of approximately 104 units. The most recent three periods (P27-P29) show mean demand of ~88 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this cooling trend while providing enough weight to avoid reacting too sharply to a single dip. Regarding lead time, recent successful deliveries (P22, P23) returned to the promised 2-period lead time. However, I must account for the high historical loss rate. The current 'In-transit' figure of 886 matches the total confirmed losses previously identified (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (N=6), the OR engine will generate an order to cover the (L+1) period demand minus the effective pipeline (which is 0), finally restocking on-hand inventory which has been empty since P28.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late summer cooling phase: average demand for P24-P29 is 104 units/week. Effective pipeline inventory remains 0 as all 886 units currently 'in-transit' are documented historical losses.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from its summer peak (~290-335 units) into a significantly lower late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last seven periods (P24-P30), demand has averaged 102 units/week, with the most recent four periods (P27-P30) stabilizing around 90 units/week. This level is consistent with a seasonal cooling. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 886 units is composed entirely of historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. I will set the lead time parameter to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22-P23) adhered to the promised 2-period lead time. For demand, I'll use a 'recent_N' of 7 to capture the post-peak stability (average ~104) while minimizing the influence of the high-summer volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' of 7 to capture current variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late summer/early autumn cooling phase: P24-P30 average is 102 units/week. Effective pipeline remains 0 as the 886 in-transit units are confirmed historical losses.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/9/16, which marks the transition from late summer to autumn. Demand for sneaker socks has stabilized significantly after the summer peak, with an average of approximately 88 units/week over the last 5 periods (P27-P31: 95, 80, 88, 96, 79). This stabilization indicates the current demand regime. Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' quantity of 886 units consists entirely of historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0 and on-hand inventory is also 0. To restore service levels for the autumn season, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 8-period average (capturing the post-peak stability) and use calculate for L to leverage the actual lead time performance which has typically been 1.5 periods when successful. The OR backend will use these to generate a base stock level that covers the 0 effective inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for autumn transition: average demand P27-P31 is 87.6 units/week, down from summer peaks of ~330.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' has clearly transitioned from a summer peak (~300 units/week) to an autumn baseline. Over the last six periods (P27-P32), demand has stabilized at a much lower range, specifically averaging 85 units per week (95, 80, 88, 96, 79, 72). The product is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The reported 'In-transit' of 886 units is entirely composed of confirmed historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. To resume service, I must trigger a new order based on the current autumn demand regime. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this stable autumn level (~85 units/week) and use the standard lead time of 2. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same 6-period regime to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: demand has stabilized at ~85 units/week (P27-P32 average) following the end of summer seasonality.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442010 (Sneaker Socks) is transitioning from its peak summer seasonality into autumn. Demand appears to have stabilized significantly lower than its mid-summer peak of ~330 units. However, Period 33 showed a sudden demand spike to 183 units, deviating from the recent trend of ~85 units (P27-P32). I will treat this spike as volatility rather than a permanent regime shift, given the late September date. Regarding inventory, the system reports 886 units 'in-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are accumulated losses from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, and 19. The effective pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is also 0. To prevent significant stockouts while accounting for the lower autumn baseline and the recent demand spike, I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering P27-P33). This balances the recent stability with the latest spike. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' as actual arrivals have ranged between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Effective pipeline remains 0 as 886 in-transit units are confirmed losses. Autumn demand stabilized at ~85 units/week but showed a temporary spike to 183 in Period 33.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442010 (3p Sneaker Socks) is currently in an autumn demand regime. After a high-demand summer peak (~300 units/week), demand dropped and stabilized significantly. The last 8 periods (P27-P34) show a mean demand of approximately 92.25 units/week, although Period 33 exhibited an isolated spike to 183. Excluding that spike, the baseline is closer to 80 units/week. Most critically, the reported 'In-transit' of 886 units consists entirely of historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), which has been consistently tracked in carry-over insights. Total on-hand is currently 0. To satisfy demand over the next 3 periods (Lead time 2 + Review 1), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 8-period average to account for the autumn baseline and the volatility seen in Period 33. I use recent_N (N=8) to capture this post-summer stabilization while acknowledging recent variance. Lead time is set to default as recent successful deliveries (P22-P23) adhered to the promised lead time of 2.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a summer peak (~300/week) through an autumn cooling phase. The most recent demand samples (P34: 50, P35: 43) combined with the pre-spike baseline suggest a return to lower, stable levels. The unusually high demand in P33 (183) is likely an outlier or a brief promotional effect. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P31-P35) to capture the current low-demand regime (~65 units/week across L+1 periods). Regarding inventory, the reported 'In-transit' of 886 units is entirely composed of confirmed historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is zero and the system is currently at zero on-hand. I will maintain L at the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P22-P23) adhered to this lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed below 100 units/week as of October (P34-P35 avg: 46.5). Previous 'In-transit' units (886) are confirmed losses; effective inventory is zero.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in an autumn demand regime for sneaker socks, where demand has significantly dropped from summer peaks (approx. 300+) to a much lower, more stable level. Over the last three periods (P34-P36), demand was 50, 43, and 51, averaging 48.0 units/week. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the average is 77.1 units/week, but the most recent 3-period block is consistently under 55. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower late-autumn trough. Regarding inventory: the system shows 886 units in-transit, but historical analysis from carry-over insights confirms these are accumulated lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, and P19. Therefore, effective inventory (on-hand + actual pipeline) is 0. Despite the 'in-transit' figure, the OR backend's capped policy should allow an order because the base stock calculated from current demand will exceed the zero effective inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average of successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized below 55 units/week in mid-October (P34-P36 average: 48.0). Effective pipeline remains 0 as 886 in-transit units are confirmed historical losses.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442010 (Sneaker Socks) is currently in a low-demand autumn regime following its summer peak. In the last four weeks (P34-P37), demand has stabilized at an average of 49.25 units/week (50, 43, 51, 53). Previous 'In-transit' inventory of 886 units consists of confirmed historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19) and should be ignored for effective pipeline calculations. With on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 0, a new order is required to meet autumn demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. Lead time is set to default (2) as recent successful arrivals (P22, P23) returned to the promised 2-period window.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at ~50 units/week (P34-P37 average: 49.25). All 886 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed historical losses, making the effective pipeline zero.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in a stabilized late autumn demand regime for sneaker socks. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 51.8 units/week (50, 43, 51, 53, 62). This represents a significant decline from the summer peak, consistent with seasonal expectations for this product category. The 'In-transit' balance of 886 units is entirely composed of confirmed historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is zero. Current on-hand inventory is also zero. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this low-demand autumn regime, while using the default promised lead time of 2 periods to resume ordering, as recent successful deliveries (P20, P21) adhered to that window.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. The product is 3-pack sneaker socks, which are highly seasonal. Historical demand peaked mid-summer (~300 units/week) and has now stabilized in a late autumn regime. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 50.3 units/week (values: 50, 43, 51, 53, 62, 43), showing very low volatility. On-hand inventory is 0. Although 'In-transit' reflects 886 units, these are confirmed historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19, P20) following the carry-over insights; thus, the effective pipeline is 0. I will set the OR parameters to capture this new low-demand regime using the last 6 periods (N=6) to ensure the base stock covers current demand levels without over-ordering as we move deeper into winter. Lead time is set to default (2) as recent successful deliveries (P21) adhered to the promised schedule. Since we are at 0 stock and have no reliable units arriving soon, the OR engine needs to trigger a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at ~50 units/week (P34-P39 average: 50.3). All 886 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed historical losses.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The product (3p Sneaker Socks) has moved through its peak summer seasonality and is now in a stable autumn/winter low-demand regime. The demand for the last 7 periods (P34-P40) has consistently averaged 51.1 units per week, with low volatility. All 886 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are documented historical losses from earlier in the year (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is zero. Since on-hand inventory is also zero, a new order is necessary to meet current demand. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the recent 7-period stable regime (N=7) and use the recent 7-period standard deviation for sigma_hat to maintain an appropriate service level without excessive holding costs. Lead time L is set to 'default' (2 periods) as recent successful arrivals (P22, P23) occurred within the promised window.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has stabilized in an autumn/winter low-season regime. Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), demand has averaged 50.25 units/week with low volatility (standard deviation ~6.5), a significant drop from the summer peak of ~330. Previous Carry-Over Insights confirm that the 886 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are historical losses from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 17, and 19. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is zero, and we must place new orders to meet current demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this stable low-demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to use historical successful delivery times. This approach ensures the OR backend builds a base stock sufficient to cover the 2rd period lead time plus safety stock for the current localized demand level.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 2, 2019. We have entered the holiday season. After a long period of stable autumn demand (~50 units/week), Period 42 showed a significant jump to 140 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday (Nov 25) or early December gifting. Since sneaker socks are a seasonal item, this spike needs to be reflected in our base stock. I will use a shorter window for demand (recent_N=5) to capture this upward shift while tempering the single-point volatility of the 140-unit spike. All 886 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to account for the jump from the ~50 range to the ~140 level. Lead time L is set to 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P22-P23) followed the promised window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand surged to 140 units (+180% vs autumn average) as December begins.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are navigating the Christmas holiday season for '3p Sneaker Socks'. Historically, demand spiked to 140 in P42 (late Nov) but plummeted to 24 in P43 (early Dec). This high volatility is common in retail around pre-holiday shipping cut-offs or shifts in consumer behavior towards gifts. However, sneak socks are typically high-volume staples. The 'In-transit' figure of 886 units is confirmed as a collection of historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19) from earlier in the year; therefore, the effective pipeline and on-hand inventory are both currently zero. To restart supply for the remainder of the holiday peak and upcoming January clearance/demand, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 (promised) to restart ordering. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (P39-P43) is approximately 65 units/week; however, P42 showed a capacity for 140. Given the move towards mid-December, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent volatility while remaining conservative enough to avoid excessive holding costs if demand remains low like P43.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday season demand for sneaker socks is highly volatile, showing a spike to 140 (P42) followed by a drop to 24 (P43). Inventory remains critical as 100% of reported 'In-transit' (886 units) over the course of the year are confirmed losses.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for sneaker socks has entered a late-autumn/early-winter lull following a brief retail spike in Period 42. Recent demand (P43-P44) has dropped significantly to ~20 units/week. While holiday seasonality can be volatile, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the listed 'In-transit' units (886) are historically confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. To capture the current low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering during a potential clearing phase, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=11 (P34-P44) covers the stabilized autumn/early winter period, excluding the anomalous P33 spike but including the P42 holiday bump, resulting in a conservative mean of ~53 units/period. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delivery performance (often 1-2 periods) rather than just the promised 2.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December). Historical data for this SKU (sneaker socks) shows a significant holiday peak was expected, but actual demand in Dec (P42=140, P43=24, P44=19, P45=26) suggests the spike was very short-lived or occurred earlier than anticipated. We are currently at a low demand regime (avg ~23 units/week over last 3 periods). The on-hand inventory is 0. Although the system reports 886 units 'In-transit', these are confirmed historical losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19) and will never arrive, so the effective pipeline is 0. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the actual performance of successful deliveries (often 1-2 periods). I will use a short recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand post-spike regime and prevent over-ordering during the post-holiday lull, while using a similar recent window for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen during the transition from the P42 spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike was short-lived: demand dropped from 140 (P42) to an average of ~23 units/week in mid-to-late December.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442010 (3p Sneaker Socks) is at the end of its seasonal cycle (late December). Current demand has stabilized at a low trough, with the last four periods averaging ~23.5 units/week (P43-P46). There was a brief holiday spike in late November (P42: 140 units), but it did not persist. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 886 units is composed entirely of historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P19) and should be treated as 0 for replenishment calculations. To maintain a lean inventory during this low-demand phase and avoid unnecessary holding costs, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current post-holiday baseline of ~23 units/week. Lead time is kept at the default (promised 2) as recent successful arrivals (P22-P23) aligned with that window, even though reliability has been poor throughout the year.
