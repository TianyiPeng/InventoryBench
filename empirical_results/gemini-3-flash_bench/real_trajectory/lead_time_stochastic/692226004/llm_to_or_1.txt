Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we are initiating the inventory policy for 'Anita Tank' (692226004), a basic jersey vest top. The historical demand for the past 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 31.8 units/week with a standard deviation of 5.54. The date is Feb 11, moving into spring/summer for a summer-staple product (tank top), suggesting demand may ramp up soon. Since promised lead time is 2 periods, the OR backend needs to cover at least (2+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all available historical data (Jan-Feb).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a basic jersey tank top. Historical demand data (from Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 31.8 units/week. In Period 1, we saw a spike to 49 units, which was unmet due to 0 starting inventory. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, the order of 42 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. For mu_hat, considering the recent spike (49) and a slightly lower previous historical average (~32), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture a more balanced forecast while respecting the recent demand level. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current volatility. L stays at 'default' (2) as we have no evidence yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Period 3 (2019/02/25). The product is a 'fitted strappy top' (Jersey Basic), which typically sees rising demand as spring approaches in the northern hemisphere. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) averaged 31.8 units. However, observed demand in P1 (49) and P2 (57) suggests a significant upward shift or seasonal trend compared to the earlier Jan samples. Total demand over the last 5 periods (including historical) shows a clear upward trend (28, 31, 39, 25, 36, 49, 57). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order of 42 units is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P3 and be visible in P4 START. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 93 units in-transit (P1: 42, P2: 51). To capture the recent demand surge, I will use recent_N (N=4, covering the last two historical and two actual periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring we account for the higher volume (avg ~42+) while waiting for arrivals to stabilize our inventory position.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fitted strappy top', a seasonal item likely seeing increased demand as spring approaches (March 4th). Historical demand since February has been increasing: 49, 57, 84. The mean of the provided seed samples (Jan-early Feb) was ~31.8, but current demand is significantly higher, indicating a seasonal regime shift. Regarding supply, the promised lead time is 2 periods. Order P1 (placed 2019-02-11) should have arrived during P3 and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms a lead time delay or a loss. If it arrives in P4, the actual lead time is 3. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for this observed delay and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward demand trend (avg ~63.3) instead of the lower January baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11th: mean demand increased from ~32 to ~63 (+97%) likely due to spring seasonality for strappy tops. Lead time delay observed: P1 order (promised L=2) did not arrive by P3 conclude.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a strappy tank top. Historical demand before Feb 11 was ~32, but shifted significantly higher (Feb 11-Mar 4 demands: 49, 57, 84, 53). Mean demand over these 4 periods is 60.75, confirming the seasonal regime shift. On-hand inventory is 0 after selling all 51 units that arrived in P4. We have 189 units in-transit: P1 order (42), P3 order (53), and P4 order (94). Note: The P2 order (51 units) arrived in P4 (L=2). The P1 order is now significantly overdue; it was placed 4 periods ago and still hasn't arrived. Since P2 arrived successfully, P1 is likely a lost shipment. To adjust the OR backend, I will use L=2 (confirmed by P2 arrival) but set mu_hat to explicitly cover the new demand level. mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 3 * 60.75 = 182.25. Since 189 units are in-transit (but 42 are likely lost), the pipeline calculation [189-42 = 147] vs base_stock will trigger an order to cover the shortfall and maintain service levels for the spring season.

Carry-over insight: P1 shipment (42 units) confirmed lost: P2 through P4 messages confirm P2 arrival (L=2) while P1 remains absent after 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a 'strappy top', which is highly seasonal for the spring/summer transition. Historical demand shifted significantly around Feb 11th, moving from an average of ~32 to ~54.2 over the last 5 periods (49, 57, 84, 53, 28). The dip in Period 5 (demand=28) might be a temporary fluctuation or stockout-influenced, but given the product type and date, demand is expected to remain high compared to January. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and we have 206 units in transit. The Period 1 order (42 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 3 order (53 units) was expected in Period 5 but has not arrived yet, suggesting a potential lead-time drift or delay beyond the promised 2 periods (L=2). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the pipeline and account for the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods using a recent 5-period average (approx 54.2 * 3 = 162.6). I'll use explicit calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the lost shipment and high variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability detected: Period 1 shipment lost; Period 3 shipment (ordered 2019/2/25) delayed beyond promised L=2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fitted strappy top', which is highly seasonal as we move into spring (March). Current demand analysis shows a significant shift from the initial January mean (~31) to a much higher February/March mean (~58 overall, with recent spikes reaching 78-84). Despite the promised lead time (L) of 2, actual performance has been unstable: Period 1's order was lost, Period 2 arrived on time (L=2), Period 5 arrived early (L=1), and Period 3/4 orders are currently delayed/missing. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 189 in-transit. Given the high demand and stockouts, I am using a recent window (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the spring upward trend while being conservative on volatility (sigma) to mitigate holding risks since L is unstable. I will set L=2 for the model calculation but acknowledge the pipeline risks in the mu_hat calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1 order lost, P5 order arrived in 1 period, P3 and P4 orders (placed Feb 25/Mar 4) are overdue as of P7 start, suggesting significant supply chain instability during the spring ramp-up.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the SKU 692226004 (strappy top) is in a high-demand spring phase. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 63 units/week, significantly higher than the initial January average of 31. Supply chain instability is the primary concern: P1 order is lost, while arrivals from P3 (due P5) and P4 (due P6) are overdue, totaling 147 units currently stuck in transit or lost. On-hand inventory is 0, having suffered stockouts in 6 of 7 periods. Since L=1 and L=2 have both been observed recently (P5 and P2), but P3/P4 are missing, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand \u03bc\u0302, I use 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher spring regime (avg ~63). \u03c3\u0302 is set to 'recent_N' to reflect current volatility. This configuration aims to trigger an aggressive order to bridge the gap created by missing shipments and meet the sustained seasonal demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fitted strappy top', which enters high demand during the spring and summer seasons (April). Historical demand analysis from Feb 11 to present shows a clear regime shift with mean demand rising to approximately 62.7 units (average of periods 1-8). Recent periods (6, 7, 8) show demand peaking at 78, 72, and 81 respectively, indicating the need for a higher inventory target. Supply chain instability is significant: P1 order is confirmed lost; P3 and P4 orders (95 units total) are significantly overdue (5-6 periods vs promised L=2); however, P5 and P7 arrived in 1 period. Due to these missing/delayed shipments, on-hand inventory is zero and the pipeline is unreliable. I will set the lead time estimate to 2 but increase mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (the last 3 periods of high demand) to force the OR backend into a more aggressive base stock level to capture the spring seasonal peak and compensate for stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation: Orders P5 and P7 arrived in 1 period, but orders P1, P3, and P4 remain missing/lost after 5+ periods, resulting in persistent stockouts during high demand (avg ~77 units/week in the last 3 weeks).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fitted strappy top', a spring/summer seasonal item. We are currently in mid-April (Period 10), and demand has surged to a new regime (avg ~70-80 units/week) compared to the January baseline (~30 units/week). Despite high demand, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to significant supply chain issues: orders P1, P3, and P4 appear lost, while recent orders (P5, P7) arrived in 1 period instead of the promised 2. The pipeline inventory (267 units) includes P3, P4, and P8, but P3 and P4 (totaling 147 units) are likely lost as they are 6-7 weeks overdue. To compensate for these lost units and meet the higher seasonal demand, I am using an explicit lead time of 2 (to remain cautious back to promised) and setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (~74 units/week). This will prompt the OR engine to order enough to cover the target base stock, effectively 'replacing' the lost pipeline inventory while preparing for continued spring demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/4/22. We are managing a 'strappy top', which is in its spring/summer high-demand season. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~69 units/week (64, 50, 81, 72, 78), which is significantly higher than the initial Jan/Feb mean. The supply chain remains highly unstable: we have lost three specific orders (P1, P3, P4) entirely. However, recent successful deliveries for P5, P7, and P8 show lead times of 1, 1, and 2 periods respectively. This suggests that while some shipments are lost, successful ones are arriving within the promised 2-period window. Currently, we have 28 units on hand and 189 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to account for the high demand (70+ per week) and the 2-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current high-season regime. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed successful arrivals (1, 2, 1, 1, 2), while noting the lost orders are effectively treated as pipeline inventory by the OR engine until the cap restricts further ordering if needed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in 'High Spring' phase: Mean demand (P6-P10) is 69.0 units/week. Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: Some shipments (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, while others arrive reliably in 1-2 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are deep into the spring season for the 'Anita Tank', a strappy top. Demand has remained consistently high, with an average of 70.4 units over the last 5 periods (78, 81, 64, 50, 78). The supply chain remains unreliable: orders P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 189 units) are effectively lost as they haven't arrived after 8+ periods. Recent successful deliveries (P5, P7, P8) show a realized lead time of 1-2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 198 units in-transit includes the 189 lost units; therefore, the 'real' pipeline is only 9 units (the P11 order). To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I must set the base stock to cover the upcoming 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1). I will use mean demand from the last 5 periods (70.4) and set L explicitly to 2. However, to account for the backend's 'cap' being calculated using total pipeline (including lost units), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a large enough order to overcome the phantom inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and demand for this strappy jersey top is surging as we approach summer (last period demand was 126 units). We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 units on hand and 357 units in-transit. Historically, shipments P1, P3, and P4 are considered lost. However, recent arrivals (P2, P5, P7, P8) have appeared with lead times of 1-2 periods. I will set the lead time L to 2 periods to cover the promised window while acknowledging the instability. For demand, the last period (P12) saw a major jump to 126 units, likely indicating a seasonal shift. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend of the last month (P9-P12 avg demand is ~80), which the OR backend will scale by (1+L) to calculate the base stock. The high \u03c3\u0302 value from recent volatility (recent_N, N=4) will help set a conservative safety stock to buffer against the supply chain's unreliability and high demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand surge detected: Period 12 demand jumped to 126 (+82% from previous weeks range of 50-78). Demand for strappy tops is accelerating as temperatures rise.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand early summer phase for strappy tops (Jersey Basic). Period 12 and 13 show a significant jump in demand (126 and 100 units), moving the average from ~69 to ~113 units/week. The on-hand inventory is 0 due to persistent stockouts. Lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (P11 arrived in P13, L=2). My goal is to ensure the backend base stock covers 3 periods of this elevated demand (calculated as (1+L) * mean). I will use a recent_N of 2 to capture the immediate surge (126, 100) while tempering the volatility with the backend's capped policy. This acknowledges the summer regime shift without over-extending holding costs if the peak plateaus. Pipeline inventory is currently high (348 units), so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size after considering these in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: High Summer demand regime confirmed: Period 12-13 mean demand is 113 units/week, up from the previous Spring mean of 69 (+63%). Supply chain latency has stabilized at L=2 for recent successful arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'fitted strappy top', which shows strong seasonal demand as we enter summer (May 20th). Demand in Period 14 reached 152 units, following a peak of 126 in Period 12 and 100 in Period 13. The current demand regime (Periods 12-14) averages approximately 126 units per week. Although there were widespread lost shipments earlier in the year (P1, P3, P4), recent orders (P11, P12) have arrived reliably with a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized near the promised L=2. However, with demand continuing to climb, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high summer peak (avg 126) across the (L+1) window. I will use recent volatility (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture the high variance of this seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak established: Demand for Period 14 hit 152 units, confirming a continuing upward trend (Mean P12-P14 = 126). Supply chain lead time has returned to a consistent L=2 for the last two successful arrivals (P11 and P12).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'fitted strappy top' (summer-seasonal category). Current demand analysis shows a robust summer regime: Period 12 (126 units), Period 13 (100 units), Period 14 (152 units), and Period 15 (118 units). The mean demand over these last 4 periods is 124 units. The supply chain has stabilized for recent arrivals (P2=2, P5=1, P7=1, P8=2, P11=2, P12=2), clearly favoring L=2 as the consistent lead time despite some historical losses. I am setting L=2 (explicitly, as 'calculate' includes lost shipments which skew the pipeline math). For mu_hat, I'm using N=4 (recent_N) to capture this summer peak regime (mean ~124, so (1+L)*124 = 372), which aligns with the current pipeline of 376 units. This ensures we don't over-order into a potential post-peak drop while maintaining high service levels for the current high-demand phase.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Anita Tank' (fitted strappy top) is in its peak summer season (June). Demand remains high with recent samples of 126, 100, 152, 118, and 132. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 125.6 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 404 units in-transit. Based on the history, orders P13 (0 units ordered, technically), P14 (18 units), and P15 (169 units) are in the pipeline. P15 was ordered in Period 15 and is expected to arrive in Period 17 (this period) based on the current stable L=2 lead time. Period 16's order of 28 units is also in transit. To maintain the 'High Summer' stock level, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the average demand of 125.6, and assuming the promised lead time L=2 is back to being reliable for the backend calculation, though I am monitoring for any further losses. Sigma_hat is calculated on the same high-volatility summer window.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season (June) for strappy tops. Demand has been high but volatile over the last few periods (P14: 152, P15: 118, P16: 132, P17: 92). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 119 units per week. Lead times have mostly stabilized at L=2 (P15 order arrived at P17) or L=1 (P16 order arrived at P17). I will use L=2 to be safe. Supply chain volatility is still a concern (P1, P3, P4 orders lost), so I will maintain a consistent mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent high-demand regime to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers the lead time and the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). mu_hat is set to (1+L) * ~119 = 357. I am using recent_N=6 to capture the full summer surge data starting from late April (P12).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained: Mean demand (P12-P17) is 120 units/week. Supply chain currently alternating between L=1 and L=2 for successful deliveries.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), we are in the peak summer demand phase for the 'Anita Tank'. Recent demand (Periods 12-18) has stabilized with a mean of 116 units/week (126, 100, 152, 118, 132, 92, 94). Currently, we have 11 units on-hand and 287 units in-transit (orders from Period 17 of 1 unit, Period 18 of 79 units, plus earlier missing units from P1, P3, P4 which are likely lost). The supply chain has settled into a lead time of 1-2 periods (P15 arrived L=2, P16 arrived L=1). I will set L to 2 to be conservative given the supply history. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the last 7 periods (approx 116), resulting in an explicit value of 348 (116 * (1+L)). For sigma_hat, I will use recent volatility (std dev of last 7 periods is ~22), yielding an explicit value of ~38 (22 * sqrt(1+2)). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current summer peak while acknowledging the pipeline already contains recent large orders.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a fitted strappy tank top, currently in peak summer demand (June 24th). Recent demand (Periods 12-19) has averaged 120.75 units per week, with a high of 152 in Period 19. The supply chain remains bifocal with lead times alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P18 arrived in 1, P15 in 2, P16 in 1). However, Period 1 order (42), Period 3 (53), and Period 4 (94) are long lost, and Period 12 (159) arrived after 2 periods. The current in-transit inventory of 290 units consists of P1, P3, P4 (confirmed lost, 189 units), P17 (1 unit), and P19 (82 units), plus the yet-to-be-placed P20 order. Only ~83 units are realistically expected to arrive. Because the backend OR inclusive of 'in-transit' includes the 189 lost units, the OR engine will under-order significantly if not corrected. I will set mu_hat to a high explicit value to offset the phantom 'in-transit' inventory and maintain stock during this high-demand summer peak, focusing on the recent 8-period mean demand (~121) and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Phantom inventory alert - 189 units from P1, P3, and P4 remain in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost. Backend calculations for 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory' will chronically under-order by approximately 189 units unless mu_hat is adjusted upwards to compensate for the phantom pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01 (High Summer). The product is a strappy tank top, currently at the peak of its seasonal demand. Mean demand over the last 9 periods (P12-P20) is 125 units/week. Supply chain lead time is currently fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. A critical issue exists: there are 189 units in 'In-transit' from Period 1, 3, and 4 (42+53+94) that are definitively lost. The OR backend subtracts ALL 'In-transit' units from the base_stock to calculate the order (order = max(0, base_stock - in_transit)). Because 189 units of the current 524 'In-transit' units are phantom/lost, the backend will under-order by 189 units unless I artificially inflate the mu_hat to cover this gap. My goal base_stock (with L=2, demand=125) would normally be 375. To force the backend to place an order despite the 189 lost units, I must increase mu_hat. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (125 * 3) + 189 = 564. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment despite the phantom inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season (July 8th) for strappy tops. Demand remains high, with the most recent observed demand at 99 units (Period 21) and 132 units (Period 20). My current on-hand inventory is 0. The supply chain is highly unstable, characterized by 'phantom inventory': 189 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' calculation (598 total - 234 from P20 - 74 from P21 - 82 from P19 - 1 from P17 - 18 from P14 = 189). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will under-order by exactly these 189 units unless I compensate. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a current demand mean of ~115 (avg of P12-P21) over (L+1=3) periods, which is 345, then add the 189 lost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct amount. mu_hat = 345 + 189 = 534. I set L to 2 to reflect the promised and most frequent successful lead time. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to reflect high volatility during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Persistent phantom inventory of 189 units (P1, P3, P4) continues to distort pipeline inventory calculations; explicit mu_hat adjustment is required to bypass the OR backend's under-ordering.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-July period of a 'Fitted strappy top' SKU. Demand has remained high through the summer, with an average demand of approximately 111 units over the last 11 periods (P12-P22). Period 22 demand was 79, suggesting a potential slight cooling from the 100+ peak, but we remain in a high-demand regime. Supply chain status: Period 20 order (234 units) arrived with L=2, confirming the recent reliability of the L=1 to L=2 range. Critical issue: 189 units from P1, P3, and P4 are 'In-transit' but long-confirmed as lost. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline' to calculate orders. With pipeline_inventory containing 189 'phantom' units, the backend will under-order by that amount. To fix this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * mean_demand + 189. I will use L=2 (promised and recently observed), and a mean demand of 110. Thus, mu_hat = (1+2)*110 + 189 = 330 + 189 = 519. This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock' compensates for the units that will never arrive.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22nd), the high summer demand peak for strappy tops appears to be cooling (demand softened to 79 and 66 in the last two weeks). The mean demand over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) is 94 units/week. Lead time is consistently L=2. However, the OR backend continues to face a 'phantom inventory' issue: 189 units from P1, P3, and P4 are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline inventory calculation (final order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)). To prevent the backend from under-ordering, mu_hat must be adjusted. The base_stock formula is (1+L) * mu. With L=2, the required base_stock is 3 * 94 = 282. To offset the 189 phantom units, I adjust mu_hat to (base_stock + phantom) / (1+L) = (282 + 189) / 3 = 157. This ensures the backend emits an order that maintains the actual safety stock despite the pipeline distortion.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/29. We are in the late summer phase where demand for fitted strappy tops (Product 692226004) is naturally cooling. Recent demand samples show a downward trend: P22 (79), P23 (66), P24 (60). The mean for the last three weeks is 68.3, significantly lower than the June mean of ~126. A 'Phantom Inventory' issue persists: 189 units from P1, P3, and P4 (42+53+94=189) are technically 'in-transit' but long-confirmed lost. This leads the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to under-order by 189 units. In Period 24, with In-transit=350, the REAL effective pipeline is (350 - 189) = 161. To compensate for this 189-unit gap, I am setting mu_hat via the 'explicit' method. Using a target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3 weeks of coverage) and a mean demand of 68, the required coverage is 204. By setting mu_hat to 393 (204 + 189), the backend will calculate (393 - 350) and order appropriate replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have stabilized to 1-2 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (End of Summer): Demand has entered a declining phase as of July, dropping from June's ~120 units/week to ~68 units/week (P22-P24).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the post-summer decline for 'strappy tops' (Anita Tank). Demand has dropped from a peak of ~120 units/week to a current regime of roughly 59 units/week (average of P22-P25: 79, 66, 60, 50). Period 25 demand was 50, continuing the downward seasonal trend. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods. The critical issue remains the 189 units of 'phantom inventory' from P1, P3, and P4 which are lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total (350 units total in-transit includes P23 (38), P24 (22), and likely P20/P21 remnants or tracking errors plus the 189 lost units). The OR backend formula 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory' will subtract this 189 units from every potential order, causing persistent stockouts if mu_hat is not inflated. To move towards a base stock that accounts for both the 3-period coverage (L+1) and the 189-unit deficit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (Mean Demand 59 * 3 periods) + safety stock + 189 units lost inventory offset. Safety stock (z*sigma) is approx 20 units. Target = 177 + 20 + 189 \u2248 386. To trick the backend into reaching this while it subtracts the 350 in-transit units, mu_hat must be set high enough to ensure the desired replenishment occurs as on-hand inventory (53) depletes.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand decline confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~120 to ~59 units/week (-50%) as of 2019/08/05.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (fitted strappy top) is in a clear seasonal decline following its summer peak. Demand has transitioned from a June-July average of ~120 to a late-July/August average of ~51 units (P24-P26: 60, 50, 43). I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this downward trend for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' count of 312 units includes 189 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost (Period 20/22 insights). The active pipeline consists of P19 (82 units - overdue), P24 (22 units), and P26 (0 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including the 189 lost units) from the base stock, it will chronically under-order. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that adds the 189 units back into the calculation. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand. With L=2 and mean_demand ~51, base_stock should be ~153. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 189 phantom units, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 342 (153 + 189).

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand decline stabilized: Mean demand for P24-P26 is 51 units/week. Supply chain remains unreliable with P19 (82 units) now significantly overdue, adding to the cumulative lost inventory totaling 271 units (189 confirmed earlier + 82 likely lost).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand for 'Anita Tank' (strappy top) has significantly declined as summer ends, stabilizing at a mean of ~46 units/week over the last three periods (P25-P27). The supply chain remains compromised by a total of 271 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (P1, P3, P4 totaling 189 units + P19 totaling 82 units). These orders are 10+ and 9 periods overdue respectively and are almost certainly lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' figure (312 units) from its base stock calculation to determine the order quantity, it believes we are overstocked by ~271 units. To force an order that covers current demand (avg 46) and offsets these lost units, I must continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_inventory. With L=2 and demand ~46, mu_hat = (3 * 46) + 271 = 138 + 271 = 409. This allows the backend to place an order that actually reaches the shelf. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (approx 1.5x recent mean) to account for demand and supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory reached 271 units as of Period 27 (P1, P3, P4=189; P19=82). Sustained demand decline confirmed for post-summer season, mean ~46 units/week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late August period (2019/8/26), where demand for strappy tops is consistently declining post-summer. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 47.2 units/week, down from the summer peak of ~120. Supply chain analysis reveals a massive 'phantom inventory' issue: there are 443 units marked 'In-transit', but history shows P1 (42), P3 (53), P4 (94), and P19 (82) are almost certainly lost, totaling 271 ghost units. The remaining 172 units in-transit consist of P24 (22), P28 (131), and P18 (19 - which is potentially lost but let's assume it might still arrive). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see 443 units in-transit and refuse to order, even though 271 of those units will never arrive. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate next period demand at ~45 units. For a 3-period window (L+1), expected demand is 135. However, since the backend subtracts the phantom 271 units, I must inflate mu_hat by that amount to ensure an order is triggered if on-hand is low. Calculation: 135 (Target Base Stock) + 271 (Phantom) = 406. This bypasses the pipeline deduction error.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Sep 2, 2019 (Period 30), we are in the late summer/early autumn phase for 'fitted strappy tops', where demand is consistently declining. Recent demand samples (P26-P29: 43, 44, 39, 24) show a mean of ~37.5 units/week. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 271 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) confirmed lost but still counting toward 'In-transit'. This 'phantom inventory' causes the OR backend to under-order significantly. The formula 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory' assumes the 443 units in-transit will arrive. Since 271 units are lost, the functional pipeline is only 172 units. To force the backend to place an order that covers demand, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to 420, which is approximately (Expected demand for L+1 periods) + (Lost phantom inventory). Specifically: (3 periods * 45 units/period) + 271 lost units \u2248 406. Rounding up to 420 ensures the OR logic overcomes the inventory gap and secures stock for the upcoming weeks, while maintaining a default L=2 and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand continue to decline into autumn (P29 demand down to 24). Effective pipeline inventory is distorted by total 271 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19). Explicit mu_hat adjustment is sustained to compensate for backend under-ordering triggered by these lost 'in-transit' units.

We are currently in Period 31 (Sept 9th). Demand for the fitted strappy top has entered a clear autumn decline. The most recent demand (P29-P30) averaged 21 units/week, down from late August's ~40s. Current on-hand inventory is 113 units, which safely covers roughly 5-6 weeks of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 312 units is heavily distorted by 271 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P19). Only 41 units (312 - 271) are actually likely in the pipeline (specifically from P24 and other recent orders, though recent orders were 0). Since on-hand (113) already exceeds the required base stock for the current low-demand regime (Target \u2248 3 periods * 20 units/week = 60), the goal is to prevent the OR backend from ordering more. While the phantom inventory usually causes under-ordering, the sharp drop in demand means we have an inventory surplus anyway. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to reflect the recent downward trend and use L=2 (promised), allowing the on-hand inventory to deplete naturally.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand decline confirmed: Mean demand P29-P30 dropped to 21 units/week. On-hand inventory now provides sufficient cover for the current regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Anita Tank (strappy top) is entering its off-season phase as we move further into September (Autumn), with the most recent demand observation at only 6 units. The current on-hand inventory is 107 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 10-15 weeks of demand at the current rate (average demand P29-P31 = 16 units/week). The 'In-transit' figure of 312 units is predominantly comprised of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, and P19 totaling 271 units), with the remainder likely representing a lag in system updates rather than viable stock. Given the significant on-hand surplus relative to the low autumn demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to prevent further ordering. Setting mu_hat to 0 directs the OR backend to stop ordering, allowing the existing on-hand stock to be depleted and avoiding further holding costs. Any residual demand will be easily satisfied by the 107 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand collapse confirmed: Demand dropped to 6 units in P31, with a 3-week average of 16 units/week. On-hand inventory (107) now exceeds expected demand for the remainder of the season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (fitted strappy top) is currently in a confirmed autumn demand decline. The demand in the last three periods has been 24, 6, and 15 units respectively (mean = 15). The current on-hand inventory is 92 units, which covers over 6 weeks of demand at the current rate. There is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue where 271 units are considered 'In-transit' by the backend (P1, P3, P4, P19) but are confirmed lost. However, since the on-hand inventory is already significantly higher than the required base stock for this low-demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflects the current low-demand average (approx 15 units/week) over the lead time (1+2 periods). Our current on-hand (92) is much greater than the projected requirement (approx 45 units), so the system will naturally hold and not place new orders, avoiding further holding costs.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226004 (strappy tank top) has entered a clear autumn decline. Recent demand for Period 31-33 was 6, 15, and 21 respectively, yielding a 3-period average of 14 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 71 units, which covers approximately 5 weeks of demand at this rate, exceeding the (L+1) horizon requirement (approx. 42 units). Pipeline inventory remains heavily distorted by 312 units of 'in-transit' stock, of which at least 271 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) are confirmed lost based on historical lags. Without adjustment, the OR backend would subtract this 'phantom' stock and never order, despite on-hand levels eventually depleting. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set explicitly to the expected (L+1) demand PLUS the volume of lost shipments (271 units). This shifts the base stock target high enough that the backend sees a net requirement for inventory replenishment as on-hand drops. I will set mu_hat based on the current regime (14 units/week * 3 = 42) + 271 = 313.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Anita Tank' (strappy vest top) has entered its autumn/off-season phase as of October. Demand has significantly decreased from its summer peak of ~120 units/week to a recent 5-period average (P30-P34) of approximately 14 units/week. On-hand inventory as of Period 35 is 60 units, which provides over 4 weeks of cover given the current demand trend. The supply chain continues to present distorted 'in-transit' figures due to a cumulative total of 312 units likely lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P19, and now P24 which is overdue). However, with current on-hand inventory exceeding total projected demand for the (L+1) horizon, no new orders are required. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime, and L=default is used as the supply chain is likely dormant for this SKU given the stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand P30-P34 is 14 units/week (-88% from summer peak). Total phantom inventory (lost/overdue) has reached 312 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Anita Tank' (a light strappy top) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime as we move into mid-October. Recent demand (P31-P35) has consistently stayed below 20 units/week, with a 5-week average (P31-P35) of approximately 12.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 51 units, which is sufficient to cover over 4 weeks of demand at the current rate (L+1 = 3 weeks). The 'In-transit' figure of 312 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P19, and now P24 is significantly overdue), creating a 'phantom inventory' problem. However, since on-hand inventory already exceeds the required base stock for this low-demand phase (approx. 12.4 * 3 = 37.2 units plus a safety buffer), the OR engine's tendency to under-order due to the phantom pipeline is beneficial, preventing further accumulation of excess stock during a seasonal downturn. No new orders are needed; I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to reflect the current autumn stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Autumn low-demand regime confirmed stable around 12 units/week. Cumulative phantom inventory (lost/overdue) is approximately 312 units, effectively blocking the OR engine from ordering unless parameters are explicitly adjusted. Current on-hand (51) is sufficient for the next 3-4 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is a 'fitted strappy top', which shows a clear seasonal lifecycle: spring ramp-up (Feb-Apr), summer peak (May-Jun), and a steady autumn decline (July-Oct). Current demand is in a low-demand regime, averaging approximately 12 units/week over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). On-hand inventory is 43 units, which covers about 3.5 weeks of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 312 units is entirely composed of lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P19, and P22), creating a 'phantom inventory' that the OR backend views as incoming stock. Because the base-stock minus pipeline calculation would result in zero orders anyway (due to high on-hand relative to demand) and since we are in the end-of-season phase, I will continue to keep L at default and capture the current low-demand mean using recent_N (N=5) to ensure no unnecessary orders are triggered while protecting the current stock. No explicit mu_hat adjustment is needed this period as on-hand inventory is already high enough to handle the low autumn demand without replenishment.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, which is deep into the autumn/winter low-demand season for the 'Fitted strappy top'. Recent demand (P34-P37) has been 11, 9, 8, 22 respectively, with a 4-week mean of 12.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 21 units, which covers nearly 2 periods of recent average demand. The 'In-transit' figure remains at 312 units, consisting entirely of phantom/lost inventory from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P19, and P24). Because the OR backend subtracts this 312 from its target 'base_stock' to determine order quantity, it will not place any new orders unless its target is incredibly high. However, given we are in a low-demand regime and current stock is sufficient for the immediate future (approx. 1.5-2 weeks), there is no urgent need to force a large order through an explicit mu_hat adjustment yet. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 samples (N=10) to reflect the low-demand regime (~20 units/week mean). I'll keep lead time (L) at default as recent successful deliveries followed L=2.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late autumn/winter season (November 4th), a period of seasonally low demand for 'strappy tops' in a jersey basic category. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units. In-transit inventory remains at 312 units, all of which are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P4, P19, and P24 have not arrived after many months). The OR backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) treats these 312 units as incoming, which would normally lead to zero orders. To ensure we maintain a small service buffer for the remaining 8 periods of the game, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Recent demand (P34-P38) has averaged 12.4 units/week. I will set mu_hat to 350 to neutralize the 312 phantom units and target a base stock sufficient to cover the current demand rate (~12 units/week) over the lead time (L+1=3). A mu_hat of 350 effectively signals the OR engine to order enough to reach a target level while ignoring the 'dead' pipeline, preventing a stockout as on-hand inventory depletes.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a stable low-demand Autumn/Winter regime with an average demand of approximately 12 units/week over the last 10 periods (P30-P39). Demand has remained consistent between 6 and 22 units. Current on-hand inventory is 2 units. There is a massive 'phantom inventory' issue: the In-transit total is 350 units, but historical evidence confirms that 312 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P19) are permanently lost. The OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline) would see '350 in-transit' and never place an order, despite most of that inventory not existing. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that bypasses the backend's under-ordering. I want to target a base stock level that covers roughly 3 periods of demand (L+1 with L=2). At 12 units/week, the target inventory is ~36 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 350 phantom units, I must set mu_hat = Target + Phantom = 36 + 350 = 386. I used a similar adjustment in Period 39 to trigger an order of 38 units. For sigma_hat, I will use a conservative value based on recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 692226004 (strappy top) is in a low-demand late autumn/winter regime. Recent demand (P36-P40) is stable and very low, averaging approximately 9.2 units per week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 393 units is heavily distorted by cumulative lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P19, and likely P22/P24 which have not arrived in 15+ periods). Based on history, at least 312 units are definitively lost, and the total phantom inventory likely accounts for nearly all of the 393 units in-transit except for the most recent orders (P39, P40). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' when determining the final order, it will not place NEW orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this offset. To ensure a small replenishment order is triggered to cover the current 9-10 unit/week demand while on-hand is zero, mu_hat is set explicitly to 430 units (393 phantom units + ~30 units for the next few periods). This forces the engine to recognize the need for physical stock despite the phantom pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a strappy top (vest top) likely in a low-demand winter season. Current mean demand (P36-P41) is 11 units/week. On-hand inventory is 28. In-transit inventory stands at 402 units, but this is heavily distorted by 312 confirmed or likely lost units (P1, P3, P4, P19, and P22) plus two recent active orders (P40, P41). To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I must set an explicit mu_hat that covers future demand and compensates for the 312 lost units. The goal is to maintain a base stock that triggers small replenishment orders for the winter baseline. Lead time has returned to the promised L=2 for the most recent arrival (P39). I will use explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend is not paralyzed by the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/02 (Period 43). We are in the low-demand late autumn/winter season for strappy tops. Recent demand (P38-P42) has averaged 10.2 units/week. On-hand inventory is 12 units. A major concern remains the 'phantom inventory': 'In-transit' shows 402 units, but based on history, 312 of these (P1, P3, P4, P19, and P24/P25 which never arrived) are essentially lost. The OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 402 units and conclude no new orders are needed, potentially leading to a stockout as demand stabilizes. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) periods of demand (approx 3 periods) at ~12 units/week, then add the 312 lost units to the target so the backend subtracts the phantom inventory and actually places a maintenance order. Lead time (L) is set to the default promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P39) arrived in 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory has increased to approximately 312 units. Recent demand (P38-P42) indicates a stable winter baseline of ~10-12 units per week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9th, 2019. We are in a stable winter low-demand regime for the strappy top, with demand averaging approximately 10-12 units per week over the last five periods (P39-P43). On-hand inventory is currently 99 units, which covers nearly 8-10 weeks of current demand. However, the system is reporting 312 units 'In-transit'. Based on history, these are 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P19) confirmed lost or significantly overdue. These phantom units distort the OR backend's logic, as it subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock. Since on-hand inventory is high relative to current demand, no immediate ordering is necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to reflect the low winter demand (~10-12 units/week). This ensures the base stock stays low, matching our current surplus on-hand, and prevents unnecessary ordering while we burn through existing stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for the 'Anita Tank' (a strappy summer top) is at a structural winter minimum, with recent demand (P41-P44) averaging approximately 8.25 units per week. The supply chain has a persistent issue with 'phantom inventory' totaling 312 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, and likely P19), which creates a false 'in-transit' buffer in the OR engine's logic. Current on-hand inventory is 95 units. Given that we are in a low-demand phase and only 3 periods remain in the simulation (including the current one), the 95 units on-hand provide more than enough coverage (over 10 weeks of supply at current demand rates). No new orders are needed; the goal is now to minimize holding costs while ensuring the small remaining winter demand is met. I will set parameters to prevent the backend from ordering, while acknowledging the low mean demand of ~10 units/week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, 2019 (Period 46). We are in a deep winter low-demand regime for this fitted strappy vest top, as evidenced by a 5-week mean demand of only 7.2 units (P41-P45). On-hand inventory is currently 89 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 12 weeks of demand at the current rate. There are no orders in transit except for the 312 units identified as 'phantom inventory' (P1, P3, P4, P19, and P24 - which is now also overdue/lost). Since the backend policy subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the base stock target, it will never place a new order as long as these 312 lost units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation. While we do not need to order now due to high current on-hand levels, I will keep mu_hat set to 'explicit' and based on the recent winter regime (12 units/week * 3 periods) to ensure the system doesn't accidentally trigger a massive order if lead times were to adjust. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Winter baseline confirmed at ~7-10 units/week. Cumulative phantom inventory (lost/overdue) is now 312 units (P1, P3, P4, P19, P24). Current on-hand inventory (89) covers over 10 periods of winter demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the winter low-demand regime for strappy tops. Recent demand (P44-P46) has been very low, averaging 5.33 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 83 units, which provides over 15 weeks of cover at the current demand rate. There is a persistent phantom 'In-transit' inventory of 312 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P19, and P24) which prevents the OR engine from ordering more stock even if it were needed. However, since the current inventory is far more than sufficient to cover the winter baseline through the end of the year and into early 2020, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low volatility and demand. No new orders are expected or needed at this stage.
