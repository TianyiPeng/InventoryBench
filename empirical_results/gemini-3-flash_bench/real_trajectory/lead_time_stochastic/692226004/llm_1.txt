Demand for basic jersey tops typically increases as the weather warms toward Spring/Summer. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical demand (Jan-early Feb) shows a mean of 31.8 units (28, 31, 39, 25, 36). The trend is relatively stable but leans slightly upward. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 arrives in P3 (visible start of P4). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. e) Final Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the historical mean (approx 32) + a small buffer for the upward seasonal trend and potential lead time variance, I calculated target inventory: 32 units/period * 3 periods = 96 units. I will order 100 units to establish initial stock and handle the transition into Spring demand.",

Calendar Context: It is Feb 18th (Period 2). Demand History: Samples show a range of 25-39 (avg ~32). Period 1 actual demand was 49, which is significantly higher than historical samples, suggesting an early spring seasonal uptick or a higher demand regime for this specific year. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in Period 1 (100 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution and be available for Period 4. Current Situation: On-hand is 0. Demand in Period 1 was 49 (lost sales due to 0 inventory). Inventory Strategy: I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 approach where L=2) plus a safety buffer for the high P1 demand signal. Expected demand per period is ~50. Forecasted need for P2-P4 = 150 units. Pipeline: 100 units in-transit (due P3). Decision: I need to order enough to cover the Period 4/5 gap and build a buffer. Ordering 100 more ensures that when the first batch arrives in P3, I have another batch following closely behind to handle the 40-50 units/week demand and mitigate the stockout currently occurring.",

As we are in late February (Date: 2019/2/25), we are entering the pre-spring ramp-up period when demand for light layering pieces typically increases. b) Demand Analysis: Historical demand in January/early February averaged ~31.8 units. The last two periods (P1: 49, P2: 57) show a significant upward shift, aligning with seasonal expectations. c) Lead Time: The promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (100 units) was expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (after this decision). We should see confirmation of its arrival at the start of P4. The P2 order (100 units) is expected in P4. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, meaning we have missed demand for two periods (106 units total lost). Total pipeline is 200 units. e) Forecasting: Expecting demand to continue rising or stabilize around 60 units/period. For a lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for P3, P4, and P5 (L+1 = 3 periods). Estimated demand: 60 * 3 = 180 units. With 200 in transit, we have enough to cover the immediate pipeline, but since holding cost ($1) is relatively low compared to the $4 profit margin and we have already stocked out, a small safety buffer is prudent. However, since 200 units cover the next 3.3 periods of expected demand, I will place a smaller order to maintain flow without overstocking if demand plateaus.",

However, observed demand in the game (P1-P3) has been 49, 57, and 84. This shows a sharp upward trend and a higher baseline (avg ~63) than the pre-game samples. P3 demand of 84 suggests a significant peak or a new higher regime as weather warms. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P1 (100 units) were placed at the start of P1, should arrive during P3 resolution, and be visible in P4 start. Since P3 conclude shows arrived=0, the actual lead time is likely \u2265 3, or the shipment is delayed.

The average demand over the last 5 weeks is approx 54. Period 5 saw a dip (28), potentially stabilizing the earlier spike. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (LT=2). The Period 1 order (100 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery date and is likely lost. The Period 3 order (50 units) was due in Period 5 but has not arrived; it is now 1 period late and may be lost or just delayed. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 19. In-transit is 320 (calculated as: P1:100-lost?, P3:50-late?, P4:100, P5:70). Excluding the likely lost P1 order, the reliable pipeline is 50 (P3) + 100 (P4) + 70 (P5) = 220 units. e) Final Order Logic: Target stock should cover L+1 (3) periods of demand.

Looking ahead, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (approx 3 weeks). Expected demand is ~70-80 units/week given the seasonal trend. Targeting a safety stock level that accounts for periodic shipment loss and higher summer demand, I aim for a pipeline position of ~300 units.

We currently have 526 units on hand. At the current demand rate of ~55 units/period, this inventory covers approximately 9.5 periods. Even with the high historical shipment loss rate (estimated 1350 units lost from P1 to P19), the current on-hand stock and recent reliable arrivals from P20-P22 have created a significant surplus for the late-summer season. Ordering more now would only increase holding costs ($1/unit/period) without providing additional benefit, as the 'In-transit' figure of 1300 is largely comprised of lost shipments from earlier periods (P17, P19, etc.) and potentially unneeded recent orders (P23's 200 units).",

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 43 of 47 (December 2). The SKU is a 'fitted strappy top' (Anita Tank), which is a summer-oriented basic garment. Demand has significantly decelerated as expected for the winter season, with recent weekly totals of 7, 7, 10, and 16 units. The current on-hand inventory is 414 units. Given the remaining 5 periods (43, 44, 45, 46, 47) and the current low demand regime (~10-15 units/week), total remaining demand is estimated at roughly 50-75 units. The existing inventory of 414 units is more than enough to cover this demand without any further ordering. In fact, the primary challenge is the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to the profit ($4.0/unit), making any additional inventory highly detrimental to the total reward. No new orders are needed.",

  "rationale": "We are in Period 44 of 47. The product is a basic jersey tank top, which is highly seasonal (peaking in summer and dropping significantly in autumn/winter). Current demand is in a minimal 'off-season' regime, averaging approximately 10 units per week over the last 10 periods (P34-P43). The most recent demand was only 3 units. On-hand inventory is 411 units, which is extremely high relative to the remaining demand for only 4 periods (P44, P45, P46, P47). Even at a generous estimate of 15 units per period, total remaining demand would be only 60 units.

{
  "rationale": "We are currently in Period 45 of 47, specifically December 16th. The product is a 'jersey basic tank top,' which is highly seasonal towards summer. Historical demand data shows that demand peaked in May/June (~130-150 units/period) and has since collapsed to minimal winter levels, averaging approximately 7 units per week over the last four weeks (Periods 41-44). With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, and P47) and an existing on-hand inventory of 407 units, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover any foreseeable demand through the end of the year. In fact, the primary concern is the excessive holding cost being incurred on the surplus inventory ($1.00 per unit per period). The 'In-transit' figure of 1100 units consists entirely of lost shipments from earlier in the year and will not arrive. No further orders should be placed to avoid increasing holding costs for inventory that will not be sold.",
