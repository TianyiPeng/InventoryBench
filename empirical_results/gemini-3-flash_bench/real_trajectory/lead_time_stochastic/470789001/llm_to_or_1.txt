Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'OP Brazilian 2p Low (Acacia)', a women's lingerie staple. Historical demand for the preceding 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 92.4 units per week (97, 69, 105, 87, 104) with a standard error/deviation. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first period of decision-making, there are no observed lead times or arrivals yet. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime of approximately 92 units per week. This provides a baseline forecast that accounts for (1+L) = 3 periods of demand to cover the lead time and the review period. The OR backend will calculate the safety stock based on the variance of these 5 samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Microfibre Brazilian brief', a staple lingerie item. History provided includes 5 pre-game samples (avg ~92.4) and Period 1 demand of 76 (avg so far ~89.7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (117 units) has a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it shouldn't arrive until Period 3. This resulted in 76 lost sales in Period 1. Since the order won't arrive until after the Period 2 decision, inventory will likely remain 0 this period as well. I will set parameters to cover the (L+1) horizon (3 periods). The demand appears stable around 90 units/week. I will use recent_N with N=6 (including Period 1) to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as there is no evidence yet that the lead time differs from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0 due to an initial lack of stock, leading to lost sales in the first two periods. We have orders from Period 1 (117 units) and Period 2 (115 units) currently 'In-transit' (total 232). The promised lead time is 2, meaning the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase and become visible in P3's conclusion (at the start of P4). This timing is consistent with 'Scenario A' in the instructions. Demand samples (n=5) show a mean of 92.4 and std of 14.8. Actual demand in P1 (76) and P2 (129) shows high volatility/upward drift. Since we have no confirmed arrival yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand, consistent with recent volatility and stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture current demand levels while waiting for inventory to arrive.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a women's lingerie item (Brazilian briefs). This category typically shows steady baseline demand with moderate fluctuations. Historical demand (including the provided seed samples and Periods 1-3) averages approximately 97.8 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Total in-transit inventory is 330 units (representing orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3). Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order (117 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 4 and will be visible in the next period's concluding message. There is currently no evidence of missed shipments or lead-time drift, as the lead time of 2 periods means an order placed in P1 arrives in P3 resolution/P4 start visibility, but the user instructions clarify that 'you read this message at the start of Period (N+L+1) decision phase', implying the Period 1 order should show up in 'Period 3 conclude' if L=2. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the orders have not landed yet. To be safe, I will explicitly set the lead time to 3 to account for this observed delay and use Recent_N for demand forecasting to capture the slightly higher demand seen in the last 3 concluded periods (avg ~104) compared to the long-term seed average (~92).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 is a 'Microfibre Brazilian brief', a staple lingerie item. The current date is 2019/3/11. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory started at 0 and we faced stockouts for the first 3 periods due to the 2-period promised lead time. The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (confirmed lead_time = 2), but the order from Period 1 (117 units) has not yet arrived or concluded, which is highly concerning as it is 1 period overdue. Given the 'In-transit' total is 323 (Periods 1, 3, and 4 orders: 117+98+108=323), the Period 1 order is indeed still in the pipeline. This suggests a potential variance in lead time or a delay. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 (Samples: 97, 69, 105, 87, 104, 76, 129, 108, 92). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend start incorporating actual lead time data. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior of ~102/week, ensuring the (L+1) coverage helps recover from the current low on-hand stock (23).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing a women's lingerie SKU with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand (including samples) shows a mean of approximately 93 units/week (97, 69, 105, 87, 104, 76, 129, 108, 92, 82). Current on-hand inventory is 0, with 323 units in transit. Looking at the history: P1 order (117 units) is missing and overdue (should have arrived in P3 or P4); P2 order (115 units) arrived in P4 (lead time 2); P3 order (98 units) should have arrived in P5 but didn't; P4 order (108 units) is due in P6. The 'missing' P1 shipment and delayed P3 shipment suggest supply chain instability or lost orders. Total in-transit (323) includes P1(117), P3(98), and P4(108). Given that P1 is 2 periods overdue, it is likely lost. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) to let the backend average observed performance, and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10, covering all samples and periods) to capture the stable demand mean (~93). Setting N=10 for sigma_hat as well to capture recent volatility (~17).

Carry-over insight: Potential shipment loss for P1 order (117 units) and P3 order (98 units) suspected due to non-arrival by P5.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the system is facing a severe stockout. While the promised lead time is 2 periods, the order from Period 2 arrived exactly in 2 periods (Period 4), but the orders from Period 1 (117 units) and Period 3 (98 units) are significantly overdue and likely lost. The order from Period 4 (108 units) was expected in Period 6 but has not yet arrived (it might be delayed or the actual lead time is shifting). Demand remains stable around a mean of 92 units/period (avg of all 11 samples: 5 pre-game + 6 game periods). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline likely contains 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments, I will use 'explicit' values to force an order. I am setting mu_hat to 280 (approx (1+2)*93) and sigma_hat to 40. I am keeping L at 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead time of 2, while monitoring if the Period 4 order arrives in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Shipment losses confirmed for Period 1 and Period 3 orders. Period 4 order (108 units) is currently 1 period overdue (expected P6, not arrived as of P7 start).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). On-hand inventory is 0. The SKU is 'OP Brazilian 2p Low' (lingerie). Analysis of history shows a severe delivery reliability issue. Orders from Period 1 (117 units) and Period 3 (98 units) are confirmed lost. The order from Period 4 (108 units) is now 2 periods overdue (Expected P6 conclude, currently P8 start). The only successful delivery was Period 2's order, which arrived on time (L=2). This pattern suggests that while the operational transit time might be 2 periods, the shipment failure rate is high. Because 'In-transit' counts all undelivered units (including those lost), the OR engine will see 323 units in the pipeline and likely block new orders. To force an order and replenish the stock-out (sold 0 for the last two periods due to 0 inventory), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) plus the backlog of the suspected lost shipments currently stuck in 'In-transit'. Average demand over the 7 periods is approximately 96.6. I will set a high mu_hat to bypass the phantom inventory in the pipeline and force the OR engine to place a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 4 (108 units) is now 2 periods overdue and likely lost; cumulative lost units in 'In-transit' now estimated at 323.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 570 units in-transit. Analyzing the in-transit history: P1 (117), P3 (98), and P4 (108) orders are significantly overdue (6, 4, and 3 periods past promise respectively) and are confirmed lost. Combined with the P2 arrival (115), these sum to 438 units. The only fresh shipments are from P8 (247 units), which are expected to arrive in Period 10. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the system-reported 570 units. The 438 lost units are clogging the OR backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), which will result in no new orders being placed if they are not accounted for. To bypass this, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the demand forecast for L+1 (3 periods) and add back the 438 lost units to force a replenishment order. Historical demand (recent 5: 92, 82, 86, 103, 108) averages ~94 units/period. Therefore, target base stock should be ~282. By setting mu_hat explicitly to ~720 (282 + 438), the backend (base_stock - 570) should triggered an ordering signal appropriate for the current stockout situation. Lead time L is kept at 'calculate' as P2 showed a lead time of 2, consistent with the promise.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative shipment losses confirmed for Period 1, 3, and 4 orders totaling 323 units; system 'In-transit' is inflated by 323+ units that will never arrive.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we face a critical inventory shortage. The product description (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) suggests stable demand, which is currently averaging ~91 units/period across all history. However, we have 0 units on-hand and a massive stockout since Period 5. The primary issue is 'In-transit' inflation. Orders from Period 1 (117), Period 3 (98), and Period 4 (108) are officially considered lost as they are far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods. This totals 323 units that are clogging the pipeline and preventing the OR backend from ordering more (since the OR engine assumes these will arrive). The 'In-transit' of 744 includes these lost 323 units, plus the recent orders from Period 8 (247) and Period 9 (174). To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high to force an order. Since we need to cover demand for Period 10, 11, and 12 (L+1=3) plus recover from previous stockouts, and given the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (including the fake 323), I will set mu_hat to 750. This should trigger an order of approximately 750 - (744 - 323) = 329 units, aligning with a healthy inventory target.

Carry-over insight: Total lost shipment volume is 323 units (Periods 1, 3, 4). Pipeline inventory 'In-transit' is reliably inflated by this amount.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11, the current date is April 22nd. Demand has cooled slightly since the February/March period, averaging 70.3 units over the last 3 samples vs. the long-term average of 91. The critical issue remains the inaccurate 'In-transit' calculation. We have 323 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 effectively 'lost' as they are well past lead time and never arrived. The system sees 'In-transit' as 355 units (the P8, P9, and P10 orders). However, the P8 order (247) and P9 order (174) actually arrived in Period 10, totaling 421 units, leaving only the P10 order (32 units) truly in transit. The 'In-transit' figure of 355 reflects the un-concluded lost shipments (117+98+108 = 323) plus the recent P10 order (32). Because the OR policy subtracts pipeline inventory (355) from the base stock, it will under-order unless we set mu_hat to cover this ghost inventory. Estimated (L+1) demand is around 246 units. With on-hand at 355 and ghost inventory at 323, the OR backend sees 355 + 355 = 710 available units. To trigger a replenishment and maintain safety stock, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I'll use recent demand trends (N=5 approx 82) for a baseline of 246 units (3 periods), then add the 323 ghost units to prevent the 'In-transit' inflation from blocking future orders. This yields 569.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019-04-29). The product is a staple item (lingerie) with fairly stable demand. Historical demand samples (including the initial 5 provided and the 11 concluded game periods) suggest a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units per period. Recent performance (last 5 periods) shows a mean of 89.2. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most current demand profile. Regarding logistics, we have confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 totaling 323 units. These remain in 'In-transit' (currently 355), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 32 units (the order from Period 10). Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory (355) from the base stock, it will not order anything unless base_stock > 355. With 238 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 32, we have 270 units available to cover the next 3 periods (L+1). My L setting remains at the promised 2 periods (as recent arrivals confirmed a 1-2 period lead time). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current stability and filter out earlier noise, and rely on the existing safety stock logic to manage availability.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-06. Historical data and recent trends show a stable demand regime for this SKU (Womens Lingerie briefs) with an average of approximately 85-90 units per week. The Carry-over Insights confirm that orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 323 units) are lost. These units are still reflected in the system's 'In-transit' count (355 units), but only 32 units (from Period 10, expected to arrive this period) are actually viable. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 32, not 355. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (355) from the target base stock, it will likely under-order unless I use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 323-unit gap. The target inventory for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 90/week) plus a safety buffer should be around 350-400 units. Since on-hand is 173 and effective pipeline is 32 (Total 205), we need more stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly high (actual forecast + 323 units), I can force the backend to place an appropriate order despite the 'phantom' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Calculated effective pipeline is 32 units (In-transit 355 minus 323 confirmed lost). Mu_hat set explicitly to 593 to offset phantom 'In-transit' inventory of 323 units and maintain a base stock targeting ~270 units for (L+1) coverage.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/13. Demand history for the last 13 periods shows an average of ~88 units per week, with recent demand being relatively stable. The primary issue remains the system's 'In-transit' metric (449 units), which includes 323 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline consists of the Period 10 order (32 units - now expected based on L=2) and the Period 13 order (94 units). Total effective pipeline = 126 units. On-hand is 88. Total effective inventory is 214 units. To target a base stock covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~264 units), we need to place an order of approximately 50 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 449 'In-transit' units, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 323 phantom units. Target Base Stock = 264. OR Engine logic: Order = Target Base Stock - In Transit. To get an Order of 50 while the engine sees 449 In-transit, I set mu_hat (the base stock level) to 449 + 50 = 499. L remains at the default (2), and sigma_hat is set to recent levels to maintain sensitivity.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed effective pipeline is 126 units (32 ordered P10, 94 ordered P13). Total 'In-transit' of 449 includes 323 units of permanent phantom inventory from lost shipments P1, P3, and P4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (2019/5/20), we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' balance of 449 units is heavily inflated by 323 units from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (confirmed in previous carry-over insights). The effective pipeline consists of orders from P10 (32 units) and P13 (94 units), totaling 126 units. These have not arrived yet. The demand remains stable around 90-100 units/period (average since P1 is 90). The OR backend calculates orders using: final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). Because the engine sees 'pipeline_inventory' as 449 instead of 126, it will suppress orders unless we adjust mu_hat. To offset the 323 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 270 (3 * 90). To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 270 + 323 = 593. This signals the backend to reach a level that accounts for the units it incorrectly thinks are coming.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 620 units is highly inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 323 units). The effective pipeline consists of orders from P10 (32 units), P13 (94 units), and P15 (171 units), totaling 297 units. The P10 order is now significantly overdue (6 periods), suggesting it is also likely lost. The P13 order is 1 period overdue (ordered P13, expected P15, now P16), which is concerning. The recent demand spike in P15 (179 units) may be due to a seasonal shift or promotion. Using the last 5 periods of demand (P11-P15), the average demand is 106.8. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the phantom 323 units of inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I target a total base stock of approximately 645 units (to cover L+1 periods of demand at the higher 179-unit rate plus a buffer for volatility) and add the 323 lost units back into the requirement to trick the 'In-transit' deduction. mu_hat = 645 + 323 = 968.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Effective pipeline is 265 units (P13: 94, P15: 171). Period 10 order (32 units) now confirmed lost after 6 periods. Total lost phantom inventory is 355 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand spiked to 179 in P15.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (2019/6/3). The demand has significantly increased recently (P15: 179, P16: 182), which aligns with late spring/early summer seasonality for women's lingerie/briefs. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 1,016 units, but this is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Confirmed losses from P1, P3, P4, and P10 total 355 units (117+98+108+32). These units will never arrive and must be treated as phantom inventory. Additionally, the orders from P13 (94 units), P15 (171 units), and P16 (396 units) are still in transit and within or slightly beyond a reasonable lead time window. To overcome the phantom inventory of 355 units and account for the high seasonal demand (approx 180 units/period), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. A target base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at 180 units/period is 540. To induce the OR engine to order up to this level despite the 355 units of phantom 'In-transit', I must set mu_hat to 540 + 355 = 895. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20% of the mu_hat value to provide a sufficient safety buffer for the high demand variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand increased to ~180 units/period starting P15 (previously ~90). Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10) is 355 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) entered a high-demand regime starting Period 15, with demand averaging approximately 170 units (P15: 179, P16: 182, P17: 149). At the start of Period 18, On-hand is 418 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 480 is heavily inflated by 355 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1: 117, P3: 98, P4: 108, P10: 32). Subtracting 355 from 480 leaves an effective pipeline of 125 units (P13: 94, P17: 31). Total effective inventory (On-hand + Effective In-transit) is 418 + 125 = 543 units. With a promised lead time of 2 (L+1=3), and current demand around 170/period, the required base stock is roughly 3 * 170 + Safety Stock \u2248 510 + 60 = 570 units. To correct for the OR backend's use of the total 'In-transit' (480), I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target order = Base Stock - In-transit. If I want a Base Stock of 570 and the backend sees 480 In-transit, mu_hat must be set so that mu_hat + z*sigma_hat \u2248 570 + 355 = 925. Using L=2, mu_hat is set to 890 to ensure the backend places a small maintenance order while accounting for the high demand regime and the phantom inventory drag.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Womens Lingerie) is currently experiencing a demand regime shift that began in Period 15. The recent demand average (P15-P18) is approximately 156 units per period, a significant increase from the earlier baseline of ~90. We are currently in Period 19 with 302 units on-hand. The system 'In-transit' figure of 499 units contains 355 units of 'phantom inventory' from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P10). Subtracting these losses leaves an effective pipeline of 144 units (P13: 94, P17: 31, P18: 19). Therefore, the effective inventory position is 446 units (302 on-hand + 144 in-transit). To maintain a target service level during this high-demand period and offset the OR engine's reliance on the inflated 'In-transit' value, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target stock = (L+1) * forecast. With L=2 and a forecast of 156, target is 468. To force the engine to place an order that results in a 468 position despite it seeing '499 in-transit', I set mu_hat = 468 + 355 = 823. This math corrects for the 355 phantom units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 20 (2019/06/24). There is a confirmed demand shift since Period 15, transitioning from ~90 units/period to ~150-180 units/period. The last five demand observations are 179, 182, 149, 116, and 147 (Avg \u2248 155). The 'In-transit' pipeline currently shows 547 units. However, we have a total of 355 units confirmed lost from early periods (P1: 117, P3: 98, P4: 108, P10: 32). The actual effective pipeline is 547 - 355 = 192 units (comprising the P13 order of 94 which is now significantly overdue and potentially lost, and the recent P17/P19 orders). Given the high cost of stocking out (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), and the persistent issue of lost shipments, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 355 units of phantom inventory. Targeting a base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~160 units/period plus a safety buffer: base_stock \u2248 480 + 100 = 580. To trick the OR backend (Order = Base Stock - In Transit) into placing the correct order, I set mu_hat = desired_base_stock + phantom_inventory = 580 + 355 = 935. Lead time remains 'calculate' as recent arrivals show a mix of 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified effective pipeline is In-transit (547) minus 355 units of phantom inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10). P13 order (94 units) is now 5 periods overdue and highly likely lost; if confirmed next period, phantom inventory will increase to 449.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 15, moving from an average of ~90 units/period to ~157 units/period over the last 6 weeks (Periods 15-20). The pipeline (In-transit: 801 units) remains heavily distorted by lost shipments. Confirmed lost shipments include Period 1 (117), Period 3 (98), Period 4 (108), and Period 10 (32), totaling 355 units. Additionally, the Period 13 order (94 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly past the promised lead time of 2 (it did not arrive in Period 20 conclude). I am now declaring the Period 13 order as lost. This brings the total 'phantom inventory' to 449 units (355 + 94). The actual effective pipeline is 352 units (801 total - 449 phantom), consisting of orders from Period 17 (31), Period 19 (67), and Period 20 (254). To maintain a target base stock of ~3x average demand (~471 units) while accounting for the OR backend's inability to see the 449 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock (471) = mu_hat - pipeline_inventory (801). Therefore, mu_hat = 471 + 801 = 1272. This ensures the backend calculates an order that covers demand for (L+1) periods despite the inflated In-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Period 13 order (94 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) is 449 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '470789001' has established a new higher regime starting around Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 144 units per period (last 7 periods: 179, 182, 149, 116, 147, 167, 121). The total 'In-transit' inventory of 1266 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 13, totaling 449 units (117+98+108+32+94). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 817 units (1266 - 449). This effective pipeline includes recent orders from P17 (31), P19 (67), P20 (254), and P21 (465). With On-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~432 units). The effective pipeline already covers this. However, since the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) 'In-transit' value from its calculated base stock, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to offset the 449 phantom units. Target Base Stock = (1+L)*144 + Safety Stock \u2248 432 + 100 = 532. To make the backend order appropriately given it sees 1266 units, mu_hat needs to be set high (Resulting order = mu_hat - 1266). To maintain stock and capture the high demand, I will set mu_hat to 1266 + target buffer for next periods.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) is 449 units. Current demand regime (P15-P21) average is ~144 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a demand regime shift that began around Period 15, with demand increasing from roughly 90 to an average of 144 units per period. The pipeline inventory ('In-transit') is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 13, totaling 449 units (117+98+108+32+94). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders to cover demand for (L+1) periods (approx. 3 periods total), I must adjust mu_hat to offset these 449 units of 'phantom' inventory. Specifically, the base stock targets (1+L)*mean. With L=2, base stock targets 3*mean. If mean is 144, target is 432. However, the backend sees 449 units in-transit that don't exist, effectively thinking the base stock is already filled. I must increase mu_hat by the lost amount to force an order. Since the current In-transit is very high (1565), and 449 are lost, the actual in-transit is 1116. The current on-hand is 181. Total effective inventory is 1297. With a demand of ~144, we have roughly 9 periods of stock. No new order is likely necessary, but mu_hat must accurately reflect the new demand level (144*3 = 432) plus the lost buffer if the backend subtracts the full 1565.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P15-P22) average is 144.8 units/period. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) is 449 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-854.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Women's Lingerie) currently has an on-hand inventory of 1,130 units, which is significantly high compared to the current demand regime. The demand regime has shifted again: between Periods 15 and 21, demand averaged ~144 units, but the last two periods (P22-P23) have dropped to an average of 71 units, suggesting the late Spring/early Summer peak has subsided. Total pipeline inventory is 547 units, but 449 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). This leaves an effective pipeline of 98 units (547 - 449). However, with 1,130 units on hand and demand cooling, the focus is on avoiding further holding costs. To prevent the OR engine from ordering more until the current inventory is depleted, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method at a value that, when combined with the phantom 449 units in 'In-transit', results in a base stock lower than the calculated total inventory (1130 + 98), effectively zeroing out new orders. I will use the recent demand average of ~71 (last 2 periods) to set a realistic forecast of 213 (3 * 71) for mu_hat, but as the OR engine subtracts pipeline (547), this will result in zero ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: avg decreased from 144 to 71 units (-50%), indicating post-seasonal cooling. Confirmed total phantom 'In-transit' remains 449 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-825.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high inventory state (On-hand: 1069) following a significant demand cooling observed from Period 22 onwards. Demand for the last three periods (73, 69, 61) indicates a new regime averaging 67.7 units/period, roughly 50% lower than the previous peak. The 'In-transit' figure of 547 is composed of 449 units of confirmed lost/phantom inventory (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) and 98 units from recent orders. Calculating effective inventory (On-hand + In-transit - Phantom) yields ~1167 units. Transitioning to 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this post-seasonal cooling. Given the high excess stock relative to the new demand level (1167 units / 67.7 avg demand \u2248 17 periods of coverage), the logic is to prevent further ordering while demand stabilizes at this lower level. Mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned to the recent regime length of 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-774.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 22 to present) shows a significant cooling, with demand averaging approximately 65.5 units per period (73, 69, 61, 59). This confirms the post-seasonal drop identified in Period 24. Inventory is currently very high (On-hand: 1010 units), which is more than sufficient to cover demand for many periods given the new lower mean. The 'In-transit' balance of 547 consists entirely of phantom inventory from lost shipments (confirmed: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13 totaling 449 units) and potentially recent orders that have likely been lost or are significantly delayed. Specifically, the orders from P17 (31 units) and P19 (67 units) are now 9 and 7 periods overdue respectively, totaling 98 units. Adding these to the 449 units confirms that the entire In-transit balance of 547 is phantom. Since on-hand inventory is 1010 (approx. 15 periods of supply), no new orders are needed. L is set to default, mu_hat is set to the recent demand average over the last 4 periods (N=4), and sigma_hat is set to default to reflect recent stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total phantom 'In-transit' inventory is 547 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). Demand has stabilized at a low regime of ~65 units/period since Period 22.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned from a high-summer regime (avg ~145 units) to a stabilized post-seasonal cooling phase starting around Period 22. The most recent demand samples (P22-P26: 73, 69, 61, 59, 76) average approximately 68 units per period. Concurrently, the system inventory is currently very high (On-hand: 934) due to large orders placed in P21/P22 arriving simultaneously in P23. Additionally, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (547 units) is confirmed lost phantom inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19 orders totaling 547 units), effectively making the true pipeline zero. Given that the current on-hand inventory (934) covers approximately 13-14 periods of the current demand regime (68 units/period), and the OR backend's target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) for these parameters would result in small or zero orders anyway, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the new lower demand stability. L is set to calculate to use the most accurate lead-time history available, which generally clusters around 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a low regime of ~68 units/period (P22-P26) following a peak phase. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory is now 547 units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 28 (2019-08-19). Demand has stabilized at a low regime since Period 22, averaging 64.2 units over the last 6 periods (P22-P27). This represents a significant decline from the mid-year peak (~144 units). On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 888 units, providing approximately 13.8 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. There are no sales lost since P22. The system reports In-transit inventory of 547 units, all of which are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19) and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is zero. Given the massive inventory surplus (888 units vs a recommended base stock of ~200-250 units for L=2), no orders should be placed. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly ordering due to the phantom 'In-transit' units, \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) is set to a low explicit value. By setting \u03bc\u0302 to 65 (one period of coverage), the backend will calculate a base stock significantly lower than current on-hand units, resulting in no order.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 is currently in a low-demand regime. Following a high-demand period that peaked in June/July (Period 15-21), demand has stabilized at an average of 68.2 units per period over the last 7 weeks (P22-P28). The current date is late August, and the inventory position is significantly overstocked with 790 units on-hand, which is far beyond the 3-period coverage requirement of ~210 units (for L=2). Additionally, the system shows 547 units 'In-transit', all of which are confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 17, and 19). Because current on-hand inventory (790) is already much higher than the target base stock, the OR engine will naturally place zero orders. I will set mu_hat to be explicit reflecting the current regime (3 * 68 = 204) to prevent the OR backend from seeing the historical peak, although the high on-hand stock makes over-ordering impossible in the short term. L is set to calculate to reflect the typical 1-2 period actual delivery time.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand situation reflects a stabilized low-demand regime following a seasonal peak. For the last 8 periods (P22-P29), demand has averaged approximately 75.4 units per period (73, 69, 61, 59, 76, 46, 98, 120). While the last two periods show a slight uptick (98, 120), current on-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 670 units, which covers approximately 9 periods of demand at the current average. Additionally, the 'In-transit' balance of 547 is confirmed as phantom inventory from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 17, 19). Because on-hand inventory (670) is far above any reasonable base stock level for the (L+1) horizon (approximately 225-250 units), the priority is to avoid placing any new orders. The backend's capped policy will naturally result in zero orders so long as our target base stock is less than the effective pipeline + on-hand. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current lower demand regime and allow the surplus inventory to gradually deplete through sales.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-09. Since Period 22 (early July), there has been a significant decline in demand compared to the earlier peak (P15-P21). Demand for the last 9 periods (P22-P30) has averaged 75.8 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 547 is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 17, and 19), effectively making the active pipeline inventory zero. Current on-hand inventory is 588 units, which, at the recent demand average of ~76 units/period, provides approximately 7.7 periods of cover. This is significantly higher than the target (L+1) cover of 3 periods. To avoid further accumulation of holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9-period 'low regime' to signal the OR engine that demand has stabilized at a lower level. No new orders are needed at this time given the inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak low demand regime (P22-P30) average is 75.8 units/period. Phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains constant at 547 units from confirmed lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-368.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (Period 22 to Period 31) shows a stabilization at a lower average of approximately 73 units per period (mean of [73, 69, 61, 59, 76, 46, 98, 120, 82, 44]). There is a significant 'In-transit' phantom inventory of 547 units consisting of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 17, and 19. The 'In-transit' value reported by the system is exactly 547, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. The current on-hand inventory is 544 units, which is extremely high (covering over 7 periods of demand at the current rate). No additional orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from ordering, I will set mu_hat explicitly to compensate for the phantom inventory. The base stock formula is mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat to a value that, when combined with the phantom inventory in the backend's logic, remains below the on-hand inventory, we ensure an order of 0. Given On-hand=544 and Phantom In-transit=547, the backend sees 'Total Inventory' as 1091. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current demand accurately while relying on the high existing stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-379.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a low-demand regime starting around Period 22, with an average demand of approximately 71 units/period (P22-P32). The current 'In-transit' figure of 547 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory' from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19), meaning the true pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 511 units, which at the current demand rate of ~71 units/period, provides approximately 7.2 periods of coverage. Since the target coverage for a 2-period promised lead time is 3 periods (L+1), we are significantly overstocked. To prevent the OR backend from ordering against the 547 phantom units and to account for the actual available stock, I will set mu_hat to a low floor value. This ensures no new orders are placed while we bleed down the excess on-hand inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed performance of arrived shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-281.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a low-demand regime starting from Period 22, with an average demand of approximately 68.5 units per period over the last 12 periods. The current date is 2019-09-30, leading into October. Given the product is a 'Microfibre Brazilian brief', there are no major immediate seasonal spikes expected. The on-hand inventory is 465 units, which is approximately enough to cover 6.8 periods of demand at the current rate (465 / 68.5 \u2248 6.8). The promised lead time is 2, and including the current period (L+1), we only need coverage for 3 periods (~205 units). The significant phantom 'In-transit' inventory of 547 units\u2014confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, and P19\u2014continues to inflate the OR engine's view of total stock. However, since the on-hand inventory (465) already far exceeds the required base stock for this demand regime, the backend will naturally refrain from ordering. I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=12, covering the current regime) to ensure the OR backend's target stock reflects the most recent stabilized demand pattern.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) is currently in a low-demand regime following a mid-year peak. Since Period 31, demand has further softened, averaging approximately 42.5 units over the last 4 periods (P31-P34: 44, 33, 46, 47). Current on-hand inventory is 418 units, which is significantly higher than the required base stock for this demand level. The 'In-transit' figure of 547 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19), meaning the actual effective pipeline is zero. Given the current surplus (418 on-hand units vs. a 3-period demand requirement of ~130-150 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to a low level reflecting the most recent 4-week average to prevent the OR engine from ordering against the phantom in-transit inventory, and use L=2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: average decreased to ~43 units/period. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains 547 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) has significantly cooled following a mid-year peak, entering a low-demand regime since Period 31. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 41.2 units per week. Currently, there is sufficient on-hand inventory (382 units) to cover approximately 9 weeks of demand at the current rate, which exceeds the required base stock for a 2-period promised lead time. Additionally, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 547 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19) as identified in carry-over insights; these units will never arrive but effectively block the OR engine from ordering more until the current inventory is depleted. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (approx 41 units/period) and L to the default promised lead time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) is currently in a low-demand regime. Since Period 31, demand has averaged approximately 39.3 units per period (P31-P36: 44, 33, 46, 47, 36, 30). The current on-hand inventory of 352 units is very high, covering nearly 9 periods of demand at the current rate. Additionally, there is a significant volume of 'phantom' pipeline inventory totaling 547 units from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). The OR engine will subtract this 547 from any calculated base stock, but since on-hand (352) alone already exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 3-period window (L+1=3), the order quantity will naturally remain at 0. No manual adjustment to mu_hat is required this period because the excess on-hand inventory provides ample buffer. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to accurately reflect the current low-demand environment.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 470789001 remains in its low-demand regime, which began around Period 31. The average demand over the last seven periods (P31-P37) is approximately 40 units per period (44, 33, 46, 47, 36, 30, 44), significantly lower than the previous regime. Current on-hand inventory is 308 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 7 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 547 units continues to be comprised entirely of phantom inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19), as no new orders have been placed since Period 22. Given the high on-hand stock relative to the current low demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (N=7) to reflect the current low-demand stability, and allow the on-hand inventory to continue depurating naturally.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand has remained in a low, post-peak regime since Period 31, averaging approximately 39 units/period (Periods 31-38: 44, 33, 46, 47, 36, 30, 44, 34). On-hand inventory is 274 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 7 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' level of 547 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19) and should be ignored for logic purposes. Given the excess on-hand inventory relative to current demand, no new orders are required. The parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (recent_N=8) to ensure the OR backend does not trigger unnecessary orders while holding costs accumulate on the existing surplus.

The current period is 40. Demand for the last 9 periods (P31-P39) has been in a sustained low regime, averaging 38.1 units per period. The in-transit inventory of 547 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 0. With on-hand inventory at 245 units and a forecasted demand of ~38 units per period, current stock covers approximately 6.4 periods. This exceeds the target coverage of (L+1) = 3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from ordering due to the 547 units of phantom in-transit inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the recent demand regime (3 units * 38.1 = 114.3) but adjusted to account for the phantom inventory. Since the OR logic uses base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock and orders max(0, base_stock - (In_transit + On_hand)), and in_transit is 547 (phantom), setting mu_hat to a low value will ensure no new orders are placed while we bleed down the excess on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P31-P39 is stable at ~38 units/period, down from ~76 units/period (P22-P30).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 470789001 (Microfibre Brazilian briefs) has settled into a low-demand regime since Period 31, averaging approximately 38 units per period (P31-P40). The current on-hand inventory is 208 units, which covers more than 5 periods of forecasted demand at this rate. There is a persistent 'In-transit' figure of 547 units, which consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, and P19) as identified in the carry-over insights. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom inventory and prematurely stopping all orders even if they were needed, I use 'explicit' values. I set mu_hat to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (3 * 38 = 114) plus an offset of 547 to neutralize the effect of the lost shipments in the pipeline calculation (Base Stock = mu_hat + safety_stock; Order = Base Stock - On_Hand - In_Transit). By setting mu_hat high enough to account for the phantom 547, I ensure the OR engine maintains the target service level. However, since On-hand (208) is already well above the required cycle stock for 3 periods (~114), no new order is currently necessary.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 31 (approx. 11 weeks), averaging 38.9 units per period (P31-P41). On-hand inventory is 160 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (160 / 38.9 \u2248 4.1). In-transit inventory is 547 units, but all 547 units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 17, and 19 (as documented in Carry-over Insights). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Since the standard lead time L=2, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. At the current mean of 38.9, the required base stock is ~117 units. With 160 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0, the OR backend (inventory - pipeline) would normally calculate 117 - (547 - 547) = 117. However, the OR engine likely sees the 'In-transit' as 547, making the perceived position (160 + 547) = 707, which is far above the target. To force an order despite the phantom 547 units, mu_hat must be set to effectively reach a target of [Desired Base Stock + Phantom Inventory]. Desired Base Stock = (1+L)*38.9 \u2248 117. Target mu_hat = 117 + 547 = 664. However, with 160 units already on hand, and demand remaining steady and low with only 6 periods remaining in the game (total 47 periods), I will maintain the current stock levels to avoid further holding costs, as 160 units covers the remaining needs sufficiently. No order is needed.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in a low-demand regime that began around Period 31 (demand avg ~38 units). However, Period 42 showed a significant jump to 91 units, which corresponds to the start of the holiday shopping season (late November). Based on the product description (Women's Lingerie), we should expect higher demand throughout December. The 'In-transit' figure of 547 is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 17, and 19), resulting in zero effective pipeline inventory. On-hand inventory is 69 units. To prevent stockouts during the December seasonal peak, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data that captures the start of this upward trend. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory; since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline', and pipeline is 547 (all phantom), I must set mu_hat to (Desired Base Stock + 547). Aiming for a base stock of ~250 units (covering roughly 3 periods at ~80 units/period) requires a mu_hat of approx 800.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand uptick observed in P42 (91 units) likely signals the start of a seasonal December peak for lingerie. Effective pipeline remains 0 as all 547 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in a seasonal peak period for lingerie. Demand in P42 spiked to 91 and P43 was 59. Historical data from early 2019 (Jan/Feb) showed weekly demand ranging from 69 to 105 (average ~92). The 'In-transit' figure of 768 is heavily inflated by 547 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). The effective pipeline is 768 - 547 = 221 units (the order placed in P43). On-hand inventory is very low (10 units). With a promised lead time of 2, the P43 order is expected in P45. I need to ensure coverage for P44 and P45. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of peak demand. Based on Jan/Feb data, a safe peak average is ~95 units/period. Therefore, (1+2)*95 = 285. However, the OR engine subtracts pipeline (768). To force the engine to recognize only the effective pipeline (221) and reach a target base stock of ~285, I must adjust mu_hat to compensate for the 547 phantom units: 285 + 547 = 832. This forces the engine to order enough to cover the current peak despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Effective pipeline is 221 units (P43 order). Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory from confirmed lost shipments remains 547 units. Peak seasonal demand (Dec-Feb) estimated at ~95 units/period based on historical Jan/Feb performance.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 470789001 is currently entering its seasonal peak (December/January). Demand in P44 reached 103 units, confirming the upward trend. Historically (Periods 1-3), demand in Feb was around 100 units/period. The current 'In-transit' of 852 units is heavily inflated by 547 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). The effective pipeline consists of the orders from P43 (221 units) and P44 (84 units), totaling 305 units. With 0 on-hand, we must ensure the backend order covers the (L+1) horizon. I am setting mu_hat to 831, which is (355 + 476). This value accounts for the forecast of ~95 units * 3 periods (285 units) plus the 547 phantom units, effectively tricking the OR backend into seeing the 547 units as a requirement rather than stock-on-hand availability. This ensures the 305 units in the actual pipeline are supplemented to cover the peak demand.

Carry-over insight: P44 confirmed peak seasonal demand of ~100 units/period; effective pipeline inventory is 305 (221 from P43, 84 from P44); phantom In-transit remains 547.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the middle of the seasonal December/January peak. Historical demand from early 2019 (Jan 7-Feb 4) averaged 92.4 units/period, and recent demand (P42, P44, P45) shows a similar regime of ~96 units/period. The current effective pipeline is 101 units (P44 order: 84, P45 order: 17) because the 'In-transit' total of 648 units includes 547 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). With 127 units on hand, our total effective inventory position is 228 units. To maintain coverage for the (L+1)=3 period window (approximately 300 units), we need to ensure the OR backend's target inventory calculation accounts for the 547 phantom units. Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (648) from its base stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly high (850) so that (Base Stock - 648) results in a meaningful order to sustain the peak demand, while sigma_hat is set to reflect the moderate volatility seen during high-demand periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period (P47) is at the conclusion of the December peak season for lingerie. Recent demand (P44-P46) has stabilized around ~92 units/period (103, 94, 79), significantly higher than the previous low-regime average of ~38 units. The inventory situation requires careful management of the 'In-transit' figure, which is currently 753. This figure is heavily inflated by 547 units from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19) that will never arrive. The actual effective pipeline consists of 84 units (ordered P44), 17 units (ordered P45), and 105 units (ordered P46), totaling 206 units. To maintain the targeting logic and compensate for the 547 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Specifically, a target base stock for a 2-period lead time (L+1 = 3 periods of coverage) at ~95 units/period is 285 units. By setting mu_hat to 832 (285 target + 547 phantom), the OR engine's logic [base_stock - (effective_pipeline + phantom)] will correctly calculate the order. This ensures we don't stock out as the 2019 seasonal demand transitions into 2020.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed total phantom 'In-transit' remains 547 units. Post-Dec seasonal demand remains stable at ~90 units/period (P44-P46).
