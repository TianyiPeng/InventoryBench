Historical data shows demand between 69 and 105 units over the last 5 weeks, with an average of approximately 92.4 units per period. The date is Feb 11, 2019. This is post-Chinese New Year and entering the run-up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14); however, the historical demand for Feb 4 (104) suggests demand is relatively stable in this category. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand for Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (when the first order arrives), I need enough stock to satisfy approximately 3 periods of demand + a safety stock buffer. Target stock level: Average Demand (~93) * (Lead time [2] + 1) + Safety Stock. Calculating 93 * 3 = 279. Adding a buffer for volatility (std dev is ~15), I will target around 320 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are currently 0, I must place a large initial order.",

(b) Demand Analysis: Historical data shows a range of 69-105 with a mean of ~92. Period 1 demand was 76, which is consistent with the historical range. I will forecast a mean demand of approximately 90 units per period. (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The Period 1 order (320 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3 (P1 + 2 = P3). (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Demand for P1 (76) was lost because on-hand was 0. In-transit is 320 units (due P3). (e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand until the next possible order arrives. If I order now (P2), it arrives in P4 (P2 + 2 = P4). I need to cover demand for P2, P3, and P4. Expected demand sum = 90 * 3 = 270 units. I already have 320 units coming in P3. However, I currently have 0 on-hand and will miss demand in P2 as well. To avoid future stockouts and maintain a safety buffer (targeting ~1.5x mean demand), I will place a small order to smooth out the transition, though the 320 units in transit already covers the immediate pipeline of 270. To be safe against potential lead time variance or demand spikes, I'll order another 100 units.",

(a) World Knowledge: Late Feb/Early March doesn't have major fashion sales peaks, so demand should be consistent with the historical mean. (b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples (97, 69, 105, 87, 104) average ~92.4. Current game demand (76, 129, 108) averages ~104.3. Stockouts occurred in P1-P3 because starting inventory was 0 and arrivals have a 2-period lead time. (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The order from P1 (320 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P3 conclude (which I just read). However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests lead time might be longer than 2, or the P1 order arrived exactly at the end of P3 and will show up in P4 conclude. Wait, looking at the timeline: P1 decision order arrives P3 arrival resolution. Message 'P3 conclude' should show the arrival. P3 conclude says arrived=0. This implies the P1 order is delayed or lead time is at least 3 periods. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 520 (320 from P1, 100 from P2, 100 from P3). (e) Order Logic: I am out of stock and losing sales. Since the P1 order of 320 (approx 3 periods of demand) is still in the pipeline along with 200 more units, I have 520 units coming. If I assume L=3, I need to cover demand for P4, P5, P6, and P7. 4 periods * 105 units = 420 units. I already have 520 in the pipeline. However, to account for the delay and ensure I don't stay at zero if the P1 order is lost, I will place a small safety order of 50 units while waiting for the pipeline to clear.",

Arrival in P4 (ordered P2) confirms L=2. However, the order from P1 (320 units) is now overdue. It should have arrived in P3. Since it is still not reported in P5 conclude, and its status is 'In-transit', it is effectively lost or severely delayed. d) Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0.

Reviewing the history, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P1(320), P3(100), P4(50), P10(50), P13(80), and P17(200), totaling 800 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P23 (250) and P24 (150), plus the current decision. On-hand is 217. With a lead time of 1-2 periods and demand around 70/week, the target stock for a 3-period coverage (L+1) is ~210 units. Since 217 units are already on hand and 400 are in the valid pipeline (P23, P24), no immediate order is required. The focus is on clearing the excess valid pipeline units before they incur heavy holding costs ($1/unit).",

  "rationale": "The product is a 'Microfibre Brazilian briefs' (Womens Lingerie), which typically exhibits steady evergreen demand with occasional seasonal spikes or promotional sensitivity. Demand Analysis: After a high-demand regime in early summer (P15-P21 avg ~150), demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level. In the last 9 periods (P30-P38), the average demand is 44.6 units/week. Inventory Analysis: On-hand inventory is 480 units, which covers approximately 10-11 weeks of current demand. Pipeline Analysis: The 'In-transit' of 1280 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P24 totaling 1200 units). The effective In-transit is only 80 units (though looking back at orders, even newer ones since P32 have stopped, so the true pipeline is likely near zero or minimal). Decision: With 480 units on hand and a demand rate of ~45/week, I have enough stock to last through Period 47 (end of game) without risking stockouts, even accounting for total pipeline failure. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit).",

The remaining 80 units in transit are unlikely to be needed given the high on-hand balance and the proximity to the end of the game (Period 47).

My primary goal is to maximize total reward by meeting demand while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs for the remaining 3 periods (P45, P46, P47). Demand analysis: Recent periods (P41-P44) show demand of 48, 91, 59, 103, averaging ~75 units per period. This aligns with the approaching Christmas/holiday retail peak. Total expected demand for the remaining periods (P45, P46, P47) is approximately 3 periods * 75 units = 225 units. Inventory check: I currently have 113 units on-hand. The 'In-transit' of 1280 units is almost entirely 'ghost inventory' (historical lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24), which total 1200 units. This leaves 80 units in 'In-transit' that might still arrive, but they are from older periods and highly unreliable. Given that I have 113 units on-hand and 3 periods left, I am short by approximately 112 units (225 - 113). Even if I order now (P45), with a lead time of 2 periods, the order would only arrive for Period 47's demand resolution. Since the holding cost is $1.00/unit and profit is $4.00/unit, it is profitable to order to cover P47. I will order 120 units to ensure P47's demand is met, aiming for a near-zero ending inventory in P47 to avoid holding costs on excess stock at the end of the game.",

Our objective is to maximize profit (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory). (a) Product is 'Brazilian briefs' (lingerie/underwear). The date is Dec 23, 2019 (Christmas week). (b) Demand analysis: Recent demand (P42-P45) has increased significantly (91, 59, 103, 94; avg: ~87 per week), likely due to holiday seasonality for apparel/lingerie. Period 46 (Christmas week) and Period 47 (New Year's) are expected to maintain or slightly increase this level. (c) Lead time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. The order placed in P45 (120 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of either P46 (if lead time=1) or P47 (if lead time=2). History shows a ~40-50% loss rate, but if it arrives, it will cover P47. (d) Inventory assessment: Starting OH for P46 is 19. Demand for P46 is expected to be ~90-110 units. This means we will likely stock out in P46 regardless of what we order now, unless the P45 order arrives immediately (lead time 1). (e) Final Order Logic: Any order placed today (P46) will arrive in P47 at the earliest (lead time 1) or P48 (lead time 2). Since the game ends after Period 47, an order arriving in P48 is useless. An order with lead time 1 arriving in P47 would only satisfy demand for the final period. However, we already have 120 units (P45 order) in the pipeline intended for P47. Given the high holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), and the fact that we are at the very end of the game, ordering more now creates a high risk of holding large leftover stock if the P45 order arrives or if demand drops post-Christmas. We lean on the P45 order to cover P47.",

An order placed now (lead time 2 promised, 1-3 actual) would arrive in Period 48, 49, or 50, all of which are beyond the game horizon. Consequently, any units ordered now will only incur procurement and potentially holding costs without the possibility of being sold. All previously ordered 'In-transit' units will also arrive too late to satisfy Period 47 demand.
