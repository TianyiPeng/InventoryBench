Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 728162001 (Women's V-neck T-shirt). The demand history provided (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 36 units/week (51, 30, 35, 39, 25). As we are in mid-February, demand is relatively stable but might see a slight uptick as we approach spring. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. My objective is to establish an initial base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). I will use all 5 historical samples to set the initial demand mean and volatility. Since L=2, mu_hat should target ~3 * 36 = 108 units.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). Period 1 concluded with a demand of 53, but because starting on-hand was 0, zero units were sold, resulting in lost sales. The order of 53 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (which we will see at the start of Period 4). Historical demand samples show a downward trend (51, 30, 35, 39, 25), but Period 1 actual demand spiked to 53. This product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Late February often sees the start of spring-summer transitions in retail. I will use the last 5 demand samples (including Period 1) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since on-hand is 0 and we have substantial in-transit inventory, I will keep L at default (2) and use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent demand level (~36.4 average), which results in a mu_hat of ~109.2 for the (L+1) period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019/2/25). Product is a basic T-shirt. Current on-hand is 0 with 107 units in-transit (ordered in P1 and P2). Historical demand (P1: 53, P2: 93) shows a significant spike compared to the initial five weeks (avg ~36). P2 demand (93) suggests a stockout-induced lost sale situation but also potentially a new trend. Promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order (53 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible in P4's start. Demand seems to have shifted or is experiencing early spring seasonality. I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 2 high-demand weeks plus a buffer of historical context (N=4) to avoid overreacting while acknowledging the spike, and calculate lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt', which likely sees increased demand as spring approaches (March). Current demand (mean ~76 per week over the last 3 periods) is significantly higher than the initial history (mean ~36). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 158 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (lead time 2) should arrive in P3's resolution phase and be visible in the P4 start (current). Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, the shipment from P1 is either delayed or the actual lead time is naturally longer. To ensure we cover the lead time + the review period (L+1 = 3), and accounting for the recent demand spike, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from ~36 to ~76. For L, I will remain at default (2) for now as we only have one potential data point for a delay.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Average demand increased from ~36 to ~76 (+111%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Demand has surged since Feb 11, with recent demand values of 53, 93, 83, and 121 (average ~87.5 over the last 4 periods). The previous carry-over insight noted a shift to ~76, but the most recent observation of 121 suggests the upward trend is continuing or accelerating as we move into spring. Promised lead time is 2, and Period 4's arrival confirmed a lead time of 2 (ordered P2, arrived P4). Currently, on-hand is 0 with 175 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4). To prevent further stockouts and capture the high spring demand, I am using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the high-growth regime. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this spike. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 2 as confirmed by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift updated: From 2019-02-11 to 2019-03-04, demand average has escalated further to ~88 units/period, showing strong spring seasonality for basic jersey tops.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt) is currently experiencing a massive spring demand surge. Period 5 demand spiked to 270, which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~88. This is likely driven by the arrival of warmer weather in March. The actual lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 4 saw the arrival of the Period 2 order). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all recent orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 5) are in-transit. Period 1's order is extremely overdue (5 periods since order), suggesting it might be lost. Pipeline inventory is currently 263 units (53+51+71+88). However, given the massive spike to 270 in Period 5, I must aggressively increase the forecast to prevent stockouts during the (L+1) window. I will use 'explicit' values to project a near-term mean reflecting this spike and account for higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Extreme demand spike detected on 2019-03-11 (270 units), far exceeding the previous regime of ~88. Likely peak seasonal velocity for jersey basics. Period 1 order (53 units) is 3 periods overdue and potentially lost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirt', which is currently in a peak seasonal phase. Recent demand (last two periods) has spiked dramatically: 270 (P5) and 266 (P6), compared to the earlier regime of ~88. The average demand of the last two periods is 268. The lead time situation is volatile: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), Period 1 order (53 units) is now 6 periods since ordering and is clearly lost (overdue by 4 periods), and the Period 5 order arrived in only 1 period (P6). Given the extreme demand and stockout state (on-hand is 0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture the current high-velocity demand of ~268/period. This will set mu_hat to (1+L)*268. I will set L to 'default' (2) despite the inconsistent arrivals, to maintain a conservative pipeline estimate while identifying the lost P1 units. Sigma_hat will be set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility seen during this spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: P5 and P6 show sustained peak velocity (~268 units/period), a massive increase from the previous ~88 regime. Period 1 order (53 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order). Lead time remains erratic (observed LT of 2 and 1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal peak for jersey basics (Womens Everyday Basics). The current date is 2019-04-01. Analyzing the most recent demand regime (Periods 5, 6, and 7), demand has stabilized at a high level: 270, 266, and 233, averaging approximately 256 units per period. The Period 1 order (53 units) is definitely lost. The Period 3 order (51 units) and Period 4 order (71 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively; since the promised lead time is 2, and we have seen actual lead times of 1 and 2, these are likely lost or severely delayed. Pipeline inventory is currently 804, representing orders from P5 (88 - though 88 arrived, the OR backend might still see the original order if the conclude match-up is complex, but P5 arrived in P6), P6 (337), and P7 (292). However, on-hand is 0, and we have missed significant sales. I will set mu_hat to cover the peak demand (256 * (1+L)) and use recent_N (N=3) for both mu and sigma to capture this specific high-velocity regime while ignoring the lower pre-March data.

Carry-over insight: Sustained peak demand regime confirmed for March: Avg demand ~256 units/period (Periods 5-7). Previous orders from Period 3 and 4 are now likely lost (5+ periods since ordering without arrival).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-357.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (Date 2019-04-01), demand dropped to 136 from the March peak of ~256. This suggests the peak jersey season is normalizing as we transition into April. On-hand inventory is currently high (493) following the arrival of large orders from Periods 6 and 7 (total 629 units). The pipeline includes an order of 175 from Period 8 (which arrives next period if lead time=1, or the period after if lead time=2). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P6 arrived in 2). Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost as they are far past promised lead time. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) down to reflect the end of the March spike by using recent_N (N=4) to include both peak and post-peak values. This helps prevent over-ordering as demand cools while maintaining a buffer for uncertainty. L is set to calculate to reflect the experienced variation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Peak March demand (~256) is subsiding, with 2019-04-01 showing a drop to 136 (-47% from peak). Transitions to post-peak spring regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019-04-15), moving further into April. History shows a clear boom-and-bust cycle: March (P5-P7) was the peak peak period (~256 units/period), while late February was ~88. April data (P8: 136, P9: 167) suggests demand has settled into a post-peak spring regime of approximately 150 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 326 units plus 186 in-transit (total 512) is substantial compared to the current demand levels. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost, as they haven't arrived in 6-9 periods. The lead time is erratic (varying between 1 and 2 periods). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the current stable April demand (avg ~151.5) and utilize default L (promised 2) and default sigma_hat to maintain a standard safety buffer, as the inventory position is already quite safe (over 3 periods of coverage).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in April: following the March peak (~256), demand for Periods 8-9 has averaged ~152 units/period, establishing a post-peak spring baseline.

Over the last three periods (Periods 8-10), demand has been 136, 167, and 195, averaging ~166 units/period. The trend is currently upward within this new regime. On-hand inventory is 142 units, and pipeline inventory is 175 units (likely the large quantity ordered in Period 8, though not specifically listed in 'conclude' yet). Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the current period (Review+L=3), we need to cover demand for approximately 3 periods (approx 500 units). Total inventory (142 on-hand + 175 in-transit = 317) is below this requirement. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the specific April post-peak trend and explicit L=2 as the backend should rely on the promised lead time for the base stock calculation, despite recent 1-period arrivals, to maintain a safety buffer against the erratic delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update: April demand (Periods 8-10) is trending upwards (136 -> 167 -> 195) with an average of 166 units/period, establishing a consistent post-peak spring baseline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU (Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt) is in a post-peak spring demand regime. Demand in April (Periods 8-11) has stabilized around an average of 161 units (136, 167, 195, 147), shifting away from the March peak of ~256. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 11. There are 356 units in-transit: 181 ordered in Period 11 (expected arrival P13) and 175 units from older periods (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost as they are several periods past even the most erratic observed lead times. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (average 1.4). I will set L to 'default' (2) to be conservative, effectively covering 3 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current 161-unit April average. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for recent volatility (std ~25). The OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering relative to the 181 units currently in-transit that are actually expected to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late April: Average demand for Periods 8-11 is 161 units/period following the 250+ March peak.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-06. The demand for 'Talia' jersey T-shirts has shifted from the March peak (~250) to an April baseline (~160), with a recent drop to 79 in Period 12. Considering the start of May, demand is expected to remain in a post-peak spring regime, though slightly volatile. Looking at supply, P1, P3, and P4 orders (53, 51, 71 units) are long-overdue and confirmed lost. The current pipeline consists of orders from P11 (181) and P12 (128), totaling 309 in 'In-transit' that are active (484 in total includes lost units). On-hand is 0. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To cover 3 periods (L+1), I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the April-May stabilization (averaging ~145 units/period), while maintaining a slightly higher lead time estimate to account for erratic arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: May demand shows cooling from April baseline, with P12 demand at 79 units (-50% from April avg). Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (175 units) remain missing and are treated as lost inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'V-neck T-shirt' is cooling as we move further into May. Period 12 demand was 79 and Period 13 was 42, confirming a significant drop from the April average of ~161. The current regime (Periods 12-13) averages roughly 60 units/period. The pipeline includes orders from Period 12 (128 units) which are expected to arrive in Period 14 (L=2). Shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (175 units total) are 9+ periods old and are confirmed lost, as their absence would otherwise significantly distort the 'in-transit' calculation in the OR backend. With on-hand at 139 and 128 units expected to arrive momentarily, the current inventory position is sufficient for the cooling demand. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling trend (avg ~60) and keep L at the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P11) followed this lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: May demand has cooled significantly, averaging ~60 units/period (Periods 12-13), down from the April average of ~161.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20. We are in a post-peak spring regime where demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck T-shirts' has cooled significantly. For the last three periods (P12-P14), demand has been 79, 42, and 50, averaging 57 units/period. This is a sharp decline from the April average (~161) and March peak (~250+). Current on-hand inventory is 217 units. Considering the (L+1) exposure window with a promised lead time of 2 (3 periods total), the expected demand window requirement is approximately 171 units (57 * 3). Our current on-hand inventory (217) already exceeds this requirement. Additionally, there are 175 units marked as in-transit from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are long-confirmed lost. Since the Profit ($1) vs Holding Cost ($1) ratio suggests a 50% service level target (critical ratio), and we are currently overstocked relative to the new demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the localized cooling in may demand and keep L at default to prevent further ordering while holding costs accumulate.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/27. The demand for the last three periods (P13, P14, P15) has been consistent at 42, 50, and 60 respectively, resulting in a mean of approximately 51 units/period. This confirms a significant cooling from the April baseline (~161) and the March peak (~256). Since this 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt is entering the summer season (after a distinct spring peak in March), the current 'cooling' regime is likely to persist as a stable early-summer baseline. Lead times have been consistently 2 periods for the most recent arrivals (P13 and P14). The in-transit inventory of 175 units consists of orders from P1, P3, and P4 which are significantly overdue and confirmed lost in previous insights; they must be ignored to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. I am setting L to explicit 2 (the promised and most recent actual lead time), mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current 51-unit mean, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current lower volatility. With on-hand at 157 and expected demand at ~51, the current stock covers ~3 periods, matching the (L+1) requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May: Average demand for Periods 13-15 is 51 units/period, down from the early May average of 60 and April average of 161.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt' has stabilized after a significant spring peak. Looking at the last four periods (P13-P16), demand has been 42, 50, 60, and 56, respectively. This averages to approximately 52 units per period, consistently lower than the April average of ~161 and the March peak of ~256. This represents a clear 'post-peak' regime for early summer. Inventory is currently sufficient: with an on-hand stock of 101 and an average demand of ~52, we have approximately 2 periods of coverage. In-transit inventory of 175 units consists of shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are long-overdue (12+ periods) and treated as lost, meaning the OR pipeline calculation will likely ignore them as they are not arriving. Given Profit ($1) vs Holding Cost ($1) results in a 50% target service level (z=0), we aim for a base stock that covers the mean demand over the review + lead time (1+L). With L default at 2, we need ~156 units (3 * 52). Current on-hand is 101, so a small replenishment may be triggered by the OR backend. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this stable low-demand window precisely.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late May/early June: Average demand for Periods 13-16 is 52 units/period, confirming a sustained shift to a lower summer baseline compared to the spring peak.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirts' has stabilized into a summer regime. In Period 17, demand was 116 units, which is higher than the late-May average but follows a stockout in Period 11 leading to some potential variability in demand fulfillment history. The average demand over the last 5 periods (12-16) was approximately 67 units/period. The current 'In-transit' of 175 units consists of orders from Periods 1 (53), 3 (51), and 4 (71), which are significantly overdue (13+ periods) and confirmed lost per carry-over insights. Total effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. With On-hand at 0, a new order is required. I will set the demand forecast using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current summer baseline of roughly 60-70 units, allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate order to reach the base stock level for the promised lead time of 2 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirts' is entering a mid-June growth phase (Date: 2019-06-17). Demand in Period 18 spiked to 151, up from the late-May average of ~52. This suggests a transition from a summer baseline to a summer peak or transitionary surge. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 195 units in-transit (reflecting recent orders trying to catch up). The Period 18 order of 20 units is still in transit. Given the recent surge, I will use a recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the transition from the low May levels (approx 40-60) to the current June surge (116, 151), balancing the forecast to avoid over-ordering while ensuring coverage for the (L+1) period of 3 weeks. Lead time remains volatile (averaging between 1-2 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend determine the mean lead time from history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 18: Early June demand has surged from a May average of ~52 to a two-week average of ~134 (116 and 151), indicating a seasonal summer uptick for jersey basics.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (2019/6/24), we are in a sustained summer demand surge for this jersey basic. Period 18 and 19 demand (151 and 140) confirm a high-velocity regime following the early June uptick. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 43 (ordered P19) plus the lost units from early periods (175 units from P1, P3, P4), totaling 218 units. However, because those 175 units are confirmed lost in the carry-over insights, they should not be counted as viable pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3-period average (~136 units/period) reflecting the summer surge. I will set the lead time to an explicit '2' to represent the promised lead time, as actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, but never exceeded 2. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to cover the remaining summer peak while the OR backend handles the service level balance between profit and holding costs (both $1.0).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand surge confirmed: Average demand for Periods 17-19 is 136 units/period, a significant increase from the May average of ~52.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. We are seeing a sustained summer demand surge for this basic jersey V-neck T-shirt. Demand for the last three periods (P18-P20) was 151, 140, and 98, averaging approximately 130 units/period. This is a significant jump from the May average of ~52. Lead times have been fairly stable at 1 or 2 periods recently (P18 order arrived in 1 period, P12/P11 arrived in 2 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 384 units, which includes orders from P19 (43), P20 (166), and older lost orders (175 units from P1, P3, P4). Since we treat P1, P3, and P4 as lost, the active pipeline consists of P19 and P20 (209 units). I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the current summer regime (N=3) and rely on the OR backend's default lead time calculation which aligns with the observed 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (Periods 18-20): Avg demand ~130 units/period, significantly higher than May (~52) but lower than March peak (~256).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained summer demand regime. Over the last four periods (P18-P21), demand has been 151, 140, 98, and 173, averaging approximately 140.5 units per period. This confirms the summer uptick noted in previous carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and despite 389 units being in-transit, recent arrivals have been sparse (P18 order arrived in P19, but P19, P20, and P21 orders have not arrived yet). The observed lead times in the history are frequently 1 or 2 periods. To maximize service levels during this shift and account for the pipeline, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods of the current summer regime to capture the higher mean and variance. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand velocity (~140/period) over the (L+1) horizon.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirts' is exhibiting a sustained summer surge. Over the last five periods (P18-P22), demand has averaged approximately 158 units/period (151, 140, 98, 173, 227), with the most recent week spiking to 227. This confirms the summer demand regime previously identified, with increasing velocity. The lead time remains between 1 and 2 periods (P20 arrived in P22 with LT=2, P18 arrived in P19 with LT=1). As on-hand inventory is currently 0 and pipeline inventory is 256 (orders from P19, P21, P22), and given the increasing demand trend, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher summer average (~158 units/period). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high volatility (ranging from 98 to 227). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Periods 18-22) shows higher velocity than initially estimated, averaging ~158 units/period, with a significant spike to 227 in mid-July.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (Womens Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a sustained summer high-demand regime. Average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P18-P23) is approximately 168 units/period (151, 140, 98, 173, 227, 221), with the last two weeks showing peak velocity above 220 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 436 units, primarily consisting of the large order from P23 (218 units) and an expected order from P19 (43 units) which appears delayed or lost, though we'll assume standard lead time logic for now. L is set to 'calculate' as actual lead times alternate between 1 and 2 periods (P22 arrived in 1, P21 in 2). mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the current summer baseline of ~168 units per period, ensuring the backend targets a stock level that covers the 220+ peaks seen recently. sigma_hat uses recent_N=6 to reflect the high volatility (SD \u2248 50) observed during this summer surge.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (Periods 18-23) confirmed with an average of ~168 units/period, with peak weeks exceeding 220 units. Order from Period 19 (43 units) is 2 periods overdue and potentially lost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' (Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirt) is currently in a sustained summer peak demand regime (Date: 2019/7/29). Over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), average demand has risen to approximately 213 units per period (98, 173, 227, 221, 246), indicating strong mid-summer velocity. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 505 units in-transit. These in-transit units include orders from P19 (43 units, now 5 periods ago and likely lost), P23 (218 units), and P24 (69 units). Excluding the likely lost P19 order, known pipeline inventory is 287 (P23+P24). Lead times have been erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P22=2, P23=2 and 1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the accelerated summer peak (avg ~213). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility during this peak. Profit and Holding cost are equal, resulting in a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand intensification detected (Periods 20-24): Average demand increased to ~213 units/period, up from the early summer average of ~168. Order from Period 19 (43 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early August (2019-08-05). Historical demand data suggests that the 'Summer Peak' (mid-July) is beginning to cool down. Period 25 saw a sharp drop in demand to 92 units from the previous four-week average of ~216. This suggests either a volatility spike or the beginning of a late-summer slowdown. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 579 units (ordered in Periods 23-25). Specifically, the Period 23 order (218 units) should arrive during Period 26 (promised LT=2). Given that the backend order formula uses (base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline (579) currently exceeds a (1+L) coverage of the recent average demand (approx 213 * 3 = 639), the OR backend is likely to order very little or zero, which is appropriate given the potential demand downward shift and already high in-transit volume. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the high summer mean but expect the backend to throttle orders due to the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely starting Period 25: Demand dropped to 92 units from a 4-week average of ~216 (-57%), signaling the end of the summer peak and a transition to late-summer/pre-autumn levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 27 (early August). After a heavy summer peak in July (averaging ~213 units), demand significantly dropped in Period 25 (92 units) but rebounded to 157 in Period 26. This indicates a transition from peak summer activity to a late-summer/pre-autumn baseline. The average of the last two periods (92 and 157) is approximately 125. Lead times have been erratic, with the P23 order taking 3 periods to arrive. Currently, 361 units are in transit (orders from P24 and P25), which are expected to arrive in the coming periods. With 61 units on hand and 361 in transit (pipeline = 422), and considering the expected cooling of demand to around 125 units per period, the current pipeline covers more than 3 periods of demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect this transitional baseline of approximately 125 units (N=2) and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent volatility. We will use recent_N for both demand and lead-time estimation to account for the most recent shifting environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25/26: Post-summer peak baseline established at ~125 units/period (average of P25-26), down from ~213 (+/- 40% reduction).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Talia V-neck t-shirt has transitioned from its summer peak (~213 units/period) to a lower late-August regime. Average demand for the most recent three periods (P25-P27) is ~111 units/period (92, 157, 84). We are currently in the 2019-08-19 period. Historical trends for jersey basics often show a decline as the autumn transition approaches. The 'In-transit' quantity of 287 units likely reflects orders from Period 24 (69 units) and other recent adjustments. Given the current on-hand inventory of 51 and the pipelines, we expect to see the Period 24 shipment arrive shortly (it is now at L=3 relative to its order date, which aligns with the lead-time drift seen in Period 26). I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window (P24-P27, avg ~145) to capture the cooling trend while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma_hat) observed during the transition. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the erratic actual lead times (ranging from 1 to 3).

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime shift confirmed (Starting P25, August): Demand cooled from seasonal peak of ~213 to a post-peak average of ~111 units/period (P25-P27). Lead time volatility persists with recent arrivals showing 2-3 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-26. Demand analysis: Demand has stabilized at a late-summer baseline following the July peak. For the last four periods (P25-P28), demand has been: 92, 157, 84, 89, averaging 105.5 units/period. This confirms the previously noted regime shift from the ~213 units peak. Pipeline analysis: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P24 (69 units, now 5 periods since order - likely lost), and P28 (97 units). The OR backend 'In-transit' figure of 384 units likely includes several older, unfulfilled orders (P1, P3, P4, P19, P24) which have been identified as lost. To adjust for this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat using the recent 4-period regime (N=4) to capture the current mean of ~105.5. I will keep L at default (2) as recent arrivals have been 2-3 periods, and the backend is optimized for the promised 2. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current lower volatility of this regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirts' is currently in a post-summer transition phase (Period 30, September 2019). Analyzing recent demand from Period 25 to 29 (92, 157, 84, 89, 133), the average is approximately 111 units/period. This is a significant drop from the summer peak (~213) but represents a stable late-summer/early-autumn baseline. The stock-on-hand is currently 0 with 384 units in transit (ordered in P24, P28). Specifically, the order of 69 units from P24 is now 6 periods since ordering (promised LT=2), suggesting another lost shipment or severe delay. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current 111 units/period regime. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the actual delivery variability (averaging closer to 2 but with instances of 3). Pipeline inventory (384) currently exceeds the projected base stock (approx 111 * 3 + safety), so the OR backend will likely not place a large new order, which is appropriate given the current units in transit and cooling demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Late-summer/Early-autumn baseline confirmed at ~111 units/period (average P25-P29). Order from Period 24 (69 units) is 6 periods overdue and likely lost, consistent with previous patterns of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P19).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand shows a suspicious uptick in the last two periods (133 and 170) compared to the August average (~111), suggesting an early autumn/back-to-school pulse for this 'Jersey Basic' t-shirt. On-hand remains 0, and the pipeline inventory is 287 (likely from orders placed in Periods 24, 25, 29, 30 if any, though history shows orders were 0 in P29-P30). Looking at history, the order from Period 24 (69 units) is over 6 periods old and confirmed lost. I must adjust for this loss. Actual lead time is averaging 2 periods (recent arrivals: P28 arrived P30, LT=2; P25 arrived P27, LT=2). I will set L to 2. For mu_hat, the last 4 periods (P27-P30) have a mean of 119. However, given the rising trend (89 -> 133 -> 170), I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the shift from the late-summer lull while staying grounded in recent realized demand. Sigma_hat will use the same window to capture the increased volatility of these autumn pulses.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn demand pulse detected: Periods 29-30 show an average demand of 151.5, significantly higher than the August baseline of 111 (approx +36% increase).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/9/16. We are in an early-autumn demand pulse with a two-week average (P29-P30) of 151.5 units, which is significantly higher than the August baseline of ~111 units. The most recent demand (P31) was 166 units, confirming this upward trend. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 357 units in-transit (orders from P23 and P24 are confirmed lost, while orders from P25 onwards might still arrive; however, recent history shows arrivals from P28 and P31). Specifically, in-transit includes 218(P23 - lost), 69(P24 - lost), 0(P25 arrived), 0(P26), 0(P27), 97(P28 arrived), 0(P29), 0(P30), 70(P31). Correcting for lost shipments (P23, P24), the 'true' pipeline is much lower. Since the OR engine doesn't account for lost shipments, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current pulse (avg ~156) and L=2 to reflect the promised lead time, while adjusting sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn demand pulse (Sept) confirmed: Periods 29-31 average demand is ~156 units/period, a ~40% increase over the August baseline of 111. Shipments from P23 (218 units) and P24 (69 units) are confirmed lost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/9/23. Demand analysis: September shows a sustained early-autumn pulses with an average demand of ~165 units/period over the last 4 weeks (Periods 29-32), compared to the August baseline of ~111. This represents a significant seasonal shift (+48%). Inventory analysis: On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 399 units, but this includes potentially lost or significantly delayed shipments. Re-evaluating pipeline: The last clear arrival was from P31 (ordered P31, arrived P32, LT=1). P23 and P24 orders are confirmed lost. P32 (112 units) is in-transit. The 'In-transit' count of 399 likely includes ghosts from previous lost shipments. I will focus on the recent demand regime (N=4) to set mu_hat, capturing the 165 units/period trend. Sigma stays relatively high due to the recent volatility of pulses. Lead time remains erratic but averages around 2; I will use a conservative explicit lead time of 2 for safety. The OR backend will calculate the order based on this increased demand pulse to prevent further stockouts during this autumn uptick.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn demand regime confirmed (Sept): Average demand for Periods 29-32 is 157.25 units/period, a significant sustained increase from the August baseline of 111.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '728162001' is in an early-autumn demand regime (September). Demand over the last five periods (P29-P33) has been 133, 170, 166, 160, and 140, averaging approximately 154 units per period. This represents a sustained increase from the August baseline of ~111 units. The promised lead time is 2, and while recent observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 (P31 arrived in 1, P28 in 2, P23 in 3), the backend 'calculate' method will handle the average lead time estimation appropriately given the history. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized early-autumn demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the current demand volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and in-transit is 472 (composed of P24, P32, and P33 orders), though P24 (69 units) is likely lost.

Carry-over insight: Early-autumn demand regime (September) confirmed: Average demand for Periods 29-33 is ~154 units/period, a significant and sustained increase from the August baseline of 111.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35 (2019/10/07), we observed a sharp drop in demand to 46 units, coming after a sustained September early-autumn pulse where demand averaged ~154 units (Periods 29-33). This drop likely signals the end of the early-autumn peak and a transition to a lower mid-autumn baseline as the weather stabilizes. With 472 units already in-transit and 0 on-hand, we are oversupplied for the current demand level of ~46-100 units. To prevent excessive holding costs, I am reducing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand signal, while maintaining 'calculate' for lead time to account for the historical variability (1-2 periods). The OR backend will see the high in-transit balance against this lower base stock and should naturally order 0 or very little.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 34: September early-autumn peak (~154 units) has ended, with demand dropping to 46 units (-70%), indicating a transition to a lower mid-autumn baseline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jersey Basic V-neck T-shirts' has experienced a significant downturn in mid-October (Period 34: 46 units, Period 35: 49 units), signaling the end of the early-autumn peak (~154 units) and a transition to a lower autumn baseline. This pattern is consistent with previous seasonal shifts observed in early May. With on-hand inventory at 63 and a large in-transit pipeline of 360 units (which includes orders from Period 33 of 73 units and Period 35's arrival of 112 units, leaving a significant balance), the current inventory position is high relative to the new demand regime. The target is to let the pipeline bleed out to avoid high holding costs. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the last 3 periods (P33-P35) to reflect the 154 -> 46 drop, and sigma_hat to reflect this recent volatility. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I will use a calculated average to allow the OR backend to buffer for variability while noting the pipeline is already over-indexed.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 34: September peak (~154 units) has concluded. Current demand baseline (P34-P35) is ~48 units/period, a 69% reduction. Large pipeline inventory (360 units) relative to current demand needs monitoring to prevent holding cost escalation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'jersey basics' has shifted into a lower mid-autumn regime following the September peak. Average demand for the last three periods (P34-P36) is approximately 62 units/period (46, 49, 90). The current on-hand inventory is 46 units, and there are 287 units in-transit (the bulk of which likely consists of older orders and recent replenishments from P32/P33 that arrived late). Specifically, arrivals in P35 and P36 showed a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting slightly longer delivery times than the promised 2. With 287 units in transit and a current demand expectation around 60-70 units, the pipeline inventory is more than sufficient to cover at least 4 periods of demand (approx 240-280 units). Consequently, no new orders are necessary to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set L to 3 to reflect recent observations and use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand baseline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand regime (P34-P36) established at ~62 units/period, down from the September peak of ~154. Recent actual lead times have increased to 3 periods (observed in P35 and P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-28, late autumn. We have transitioned from the September early-autumn peak (~154 units) to a significantly lower mid-autumn baseline. For Periods 34-37, demand has been 46, 49, 90, and 83, averaging approximately 67 units/period. The 'In-transit' balance is 287 units (orders from P24 and P31-33 have largely concluded, so P24 is confirmed lost and P31-33 are accounted for). On-hand is 0. With demand averaging ~67, the current pipeline of 287 units is roughly 4.3 periods of coverage if we assume a lead time of 2-3. Since profit and holding cost both equal $1, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which means the OR engine will target the median demand (mu_hat). To avoid excessive holding costs in a cooling demand environment with a large existing pipeline, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 4-period mean (~67) using recent_N=4. I'll maintain L=default as 2, although recent actual lead times have been 3, because the pipeline already exceeds the base stock calculation, and the capping mechanism will naturally limit further ordering until inventory is cleared. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility (N=4) to ensure the target reflects the current regime's variance.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand regime (starting P34, approx. Oct 2019) stabilized at ~67 units/period, a ~56% reduction from the Sept peak. Observed actual lead times for P32 and P33 were 3 periods, suggesting a possible shift in logistics reliability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for the mid-autumn period (P34-P38) has stabilized with an average of approximately 74 units/period, showing a slight increase in the last two weeks compared to early October. We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory, but a very large 'In-transit' quantity of 287 units (including 175 units of older stock deemed lost and newer orders). However, recent history shows actual lead times have drifted toward 3 periods (P35, P36 conclude messages). I am setting L to 3 to reflect this logistical shift. To manage the current stockout while respecting the high pipeline inventory and the risk of holding costs, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current ~74 unit/period baseline, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (1+3) periods of this demand, capped by the engine's internal safety logic.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand (Nov) has increased slightly to an average of ~74 units/period (P34-P38), up from the initial October baseline of 62. Actual lead time appears sustained at 3 periods based on P32 and P33 arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has stabilized into a mid-autumn/early-winter baseline. The current regime (Periods 34-39) shows an average demand of approximately 70 units/period (46, 49, 90, 83, 101, 51), significantly lower than the September peak. On-hand inventory is 0, but there are 296 units in-transit. These in-transit units are from orders placed in Periods 34-39, but notably, the pipeline includes residual volume from before the demand cooling. However, recent lead times (P32, P33) were 3 periods, meaning orders from P37 and P38 should arrive in P40 and P41. Given the high pipeline relative to the current low demand (~70/week), the risk of holding costs is high if more is ordered. I will set L to 3 to reflect the recent logistics slowdown and use recent_N (N=6) for demand to capture the current 70-unit baseline, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the large pipeline before placing new significant orders.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand (Nov) has established a stable baseline of ~70 units/period (P34-P39), down from peak seasonal levels. Actual lead time is currently observed at 3 periods (based on P32 and P33).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics V-neck T-shirt' has stabilized in a mid-autumn regime. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged 71.14 units, significantly lower than the September peaks. I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current baseline. Regarding lead time, while the promised lead time is 2, the most recent arrivals (P32 and P33 orders) both took 3 periods to arrive. Consequently, I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to reflect this sustained logistics shift. Pipeline inventory is currently 296 units, which is quite high relative to the (1+L) demand requirement (approx 285 units). The backend's base-stock logic will account for this high in-transit volume and likely result in a minimal or zero order this period, preventing further holding cost accumulation while on-hand inventory is 0.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (2019/11/25), the product is in a mid-to-late autumn baseline. Recent demand (Periods 34-41) has been significantly lower than the September peak, establishing a stable regime averaging approximately 68 units/period. The most recent demand (P41) was 64 units, consistent with this baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 287 units in-transit (largely from orders placed in Period 41 which are not visible in the summary but reflected in the in-transit total). Lead times remain somewhat volatile but have gravitated back toward the promised 2 periods (P39 arrived in P41). I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to an explicit value reflecting the current stable regime (~68/period * 3 periods), and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to maintain availability without over-ordering during this lower-velocity period.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand baseline (Nov) has established a stable regime of ~68 units/period (P34-P41), significantly lower than the September early-autumn peak of ~154. Lead times have returned to approximately 2 periods after a period of 3-period delays.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Recent demand observations (Period 42: 134 units) show a significant surge compared to the previous stable November baseline of ~68-70 units. This mirrors the seasonal behavior of 'Womens Everyday Basics' which often sees a spike during holiday shopping weeks. The in-transit inventory of 287 units likely stems from auto-replenishment logic at the OR backend or pending quantities not yet reflected in arrivals, but as on-hand is currently 0, we need to ensure local parameters reflect this new higher demand regime to avoid stockouts during the peak period. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this December uptick (averaging ~82 units/period, but trending upwards) and sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility. Lead time has recently stabilized back to 2 periods, so I will use calculate for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 42: December holiday surge initiated, with demand jumping to 134 units from a November average of ~68 (+97%).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December holiday season. A significant demand jump was seen in Period 42 (134 units), although Period 43 showed a sharp drop (25 units). Given the product is a staple jersey V-neck, demand volatility is expected around late-year gift-giving and seasonal transitions. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 287 units. The last several orders placed in recent periods (P34-P43) were zero except for P39 (which arrived). The 287 units in-transit must be monitored; however, to capture the potential rebound in holiday demand and ensure stock for the next 2-3 periods (promised L=2), I will forecast based on the recent holiday surge and the previous November baseline. I'll use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the jump in P42 while smoothing for the P43 dip, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for this recent high volatility. Lead time is set to default (2), as recent data (P41) showed a return to the promised 2-period window.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for this basic jersey V-neck has behaved erratically during the holiday season: a sharp spike to 134 in late November (P42), followed by a significant collapse to 25 and 14 in the last two weeks (P43-P44). This suggests the pre-holiday surge has concluded or converted to gift-purchasing elsewhere, and we are entering a lull before year-end or potential January clearances. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 287 units in-transit (orders from P42-P44 were zero, so these are earlier delayed shipments or systemic pipeline noise; however, the prompt indicates 287 units are in-transit). Given the current demand average of the last 3 periods is ~57 units/period and the 'In-transit' quantity of 287 is already very high (covering ~5 periods of current demand), the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent further ordering. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent sharp decline and L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile shipping history (ranging 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: December holiday surge (134 units at P42) was short-lived, with demand dropping sharply to an average of ~20 units/period in Periods 43-44.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the final periods of December (2019/12/23). Recent demand observations (Periods 43-45) show a significant decline (25, 14, 21 units) following a short-lived mid-December holiday spike (134 units in Period 42). This suggests the holiday peak has passed and demand is returning to a lower baseline, likely consistent with post-holiday cooling and winter norms for a cotton jersey t-shirt. With only 1 period remaining in the game (ending Period 47) and a current in-transit pipeline of 287 units, the inventory position is extremely high relative to current demand needs. Any further ordering would likely result in unnecessary holding costs as the game concludes. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this low demand regime, while the OR backend's inventory balancing will naturally suppress new orders due to the high pipeline and low forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Post-holiday cooling confirmed with demand drop to ~20 units/period (P43-P45) from a brief Dec spike of 134.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand for this jersey basic v-neck t-shirt has cooled dramatically following a brief December spike in Period 42 (134 units). The last four periods (P43-P46) show a very low, stable post-holiday regime with demand values of 25, 14, 21, and 24, averaging ~21 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently 287 units, which is extremely high (covering over 13 periods) given this new low-demand environment. No new orders are needed. I am setting parameters to reflect the recent N=4 period average (approx. 21) and standard deviation to allow the OR engine to wind down the existing pipeline and prevent further holding cost accumulation. Lead time L is kept at default (2) as recent arrivals (P41) align with the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand regime shift at Period 43: Demand has dropped significantly to a baseline of ~21 units/period (average P43-P46) from the brief Dec 2 spike.
