Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 52.8 units per week, with a standard deviation of approximately 5.1 units. The product is a basic jersey legging, suggesting stable demand, but it is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand for the current period and the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the available recent history (N=5). This initial order will aim to establish a base stock levels that account for the 52.8 units weekly mean.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Long Leg Leggings', a jersey basic item. In Period 1, we observed a massive demand spike (201 units), which is significantly higher than the pre-game historical average (approx. 53 units/period). This suggests a strong seasonal shift or promotional event. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 62 units in-transit (ordered P1, promised lead time L=2). Given the extreme stockout in P1 (201 demand vs 0 sold), it is critical to raise the inventory target immediately to capture this higher demand regime. I will use the last 6 samples (5 historical + 1 actual observed) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will incorporate the recent spike while providing some smoothing. L is kept at default (promised = 2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand data (Jan-Feb) showed a mean of ~53 units/week. However, since starting the game in February, actual demand has been significantly higher (P1=201, P2=77). The product is 'Jersey Basic Leggings', a staple item. Current inventory is critically low (on-hand=0) due to initial demand exceeding expectations. We have 233 units in transit (62 from P1, 171 from P2). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 (visible P4). Until we confirm a different actual lead time, we use 'default' (2). Given the demand volatility and the discrepancy between pre-game data and game observations, I will use recent_N (N=2) for demand mean to capture the higher observed volume since the game started, while using a conservative sigma estimation to manage the stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand samples (Jan/early Feb) averaged 52.8. However, recent demand in the game has shifted: Period 1 saw a massive spike of 201 (likely driven by February/early Spring clothing transitions or a promotion), followed by 77 and 57. The 'Long Leg Leggings' description suggests a basic jersey item. On-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed all sales so far due to empty stock. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (62 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible now, but 'Period 3 conclude' says arrived=0. This implies the actual lead time is at least 3, or the shipment is delayed. Pipeline inventory is high (417 units). I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay and use an EWMA for mu_hat to balance the recent demand spike with the normalization seen in Periods 2 and 3. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to capture the high volatility seen between the initial spike and subsequent periods.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; P1 order (62 units) not arrived by start of P4 (Lead time >= 3). Demand regime shifted from ~53 (Jan) to high volatility (range 57-201) in Feb.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is 'Long Leg Leggings', a staple item. Current inventory is 121 units (on-hand) and 246 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), but the order from Period 1 (62 units) is notably missing/lost as it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4. This loss caused stockouts in Periods 1-3. Demand history shows a stable Jan (avg ~53), a spike in Feb (201, likely due to low stock or data anomaly), followed by stabilization in late Feb/early March (77, 57, 50). Avg of the last 3 periods is ~61. Promised lead time is 2, but given the lost shipment from Period 1 and the arrival of Period 2's order on time, I will set L=2 but prepare for a 3-period coverage (L+1). mu_hat is set based on the recent 3-period average (~61) * (1+L) = 183. sigma_hat is adjusted for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (62 units) confirmed lost/overdue (not arrived by start of Period 5). Lead time for Period 2 order was 2 periods. Demand stabilized at ~61 units/week over last 3 weeks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). Inventory analysis: On-hand is 61. Historical demand for this jersey basic legging show a massive spike in P1 (201), but the last four periods suggest a stable regime around 61 units (77, 57, 50, 60). We assume the P1 spike was an anomaly or season-start burst. Supply chain analysis: The P1 order of 62 units is officially lost (overdue by 3+ periods since the P2 order already arrived in 2 periods). The P3 order (184 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 6 (visible in P7's conclude) based on the confirmed lead time of 2. I will set mu_hat to a stable recent average to avoid over-ordering from the P1 outlier. Since we have ~246 units (P3: 184 + P? orders) in transit and demand is ~60, our pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the post-spike stabilization.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (62 units) confirmed lost as of P6. Demand regime post-anomaly (P2-P5) has stabilized at an average of 61 units per week.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7 (2019/03/25). Analysis of product (Long Leg Leggings) and history shows a stable demand baseline after an early February spike. Historical samples (54, 60, 52, 52, 46) and recent periods (P4: 50, P5: 60, P6: 48) suggest a mean demand of approximately 53-55 units. The P1 order of 62 units remains lost. The P3 order of 184 units is expected to arrive during P7 resolution (since P2 took 2 periods, we expect P3 to arrive now), and the P2 order of 171 units arrived in P4 correctly. On-hand is 13 units. Total in-transit is 246 (P3: 184 + potentially others if generated by OR in P4-P6, though 'ordered' was 0). Since P3 (184 units) is imminent, we need to ensure mu_hat reflects the current stable demand regime (approx 53 units/week). With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*53 = 159. The OR engine will subtract the 246 in-transit from this 159 base_stock, resulting in 0 order, which is correct given the high pipeline inventory. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the post-anomaly stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable post-Feb anomaly: Avg demand 52.6 units over last 3 periods (P4-P6). P3 order (184 units) expected arrival during P7 resolution.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the on-hand inventory is 0. The order from Period 3 (184 units) was expected to arrive during Period 7's resolution (Lead Time = 2, Order Period 3 -> Arrival Period 5, but there's a 1-period observation delay, so it should have been visible in the Period 7 conclude message). Since 'Period 7 conclude' shows arrived=0, the P3 order is either delayed or lost. Order P1 (62 units) is already confirmed lost. Currently, 246 units are listed 'In-transit' (P1: 62 + P3: 184 = 246). I must treat these as unavailable. Demand has stabilized post-February anomaly. Last 5 periods demand (P3-P7): 57, 50, 60, 48, 73 (Avg: 57.6). I will set L to 2 (promised) as calculate/recent_N might be skewed by the lost P1 and the late/missing P3. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable regime (~57.6 per week) and provide buffer for the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 3 (184 units) is now overdue/potentially lost (not visible in Period 7 conclude despite promised LT=2). Total in-transit (246) consists of lost P1 (62) and likely lost P3 (184).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU 189634001 (Long Leg Leggings) is in a precarious inventory position. Current on-hand is 0, and 246 units are in-transit, but these represent two likely lost shipments: P1 (ordered 62 units) and P3 (ordered 184 units). Since P3 was ordered in Period 3 with a promised lead time of 2, it should have arrived in Period 5 and been visible in the Period 6 conclude. Its continued absence at the start of Period 9 confirms it is lost. Only P2 arrived correctly (lead time 2). Demand has stabilized after the Feb 201 holiday spike; the last 5 periods (P4-P8) show demand of 50, 60, 48, 73, and 69, averaging ~60 units/week. Given the lost shipments, the pipeline inventory is effectively 0. I will set L=explicit at 2 (promised) to trigger orders, mu_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 periods) to reflect the current ~60/week demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 3 (184 units) confirmed lost as of Period 9 (did not arrive by Period 8 resolution). All current In-transit units (246) are considered lost, requiring immediate replenishment. Current demand regime stabilized at ~60 units/week (P4-P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), the system is in a stockout state (on-hand = 0). Historical analysis confirms that both the Period 1 order (62 units) and the Period 3 order (184 units) are lost, as they are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods and have not appeared in any 'conclude' messages. These 246 units effectively don't exist in the supply chain. The OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from its order calculation. Since the backend still sees these 246 units as pipe-line inventory, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this phantom inventory. Demand has stabilized post-February anomaly (P4-P9) at an average of 57.6 units/week (50, 60, 48, 73, 69, 46). To force the backend to place an order and replenish the stockout despite the phantom 246 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I need to cover (L+1) = 3 weeks of demand plus the lost 246 units to trigger an order. Calculation: (3 * 58) + 246 = 420. I will set mu_hat to 420 and use a standard sigma_hat based on recent volatility (approx 10-12 units/week, so sqrt(3)*12 \u2248 21 for the projection).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stock-out for several periods due to lost shipments.

The order of 160 units placed in Period 10 is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 12 (LT=2). Demand has stabilized at approximately 55 units/week over the last 7 periods (P4-P10 range 41-73). I will set L to 'default' (2) as the last confirmed shipment (P2) arrived with LT=2. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 55 * 3 = 165). Sigma_hat will also use N=7 to reflect recent variance. The system's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will likely include the 246 lost units, which will suppress ordering; however, the explicit parameters and the previous order of 160 in P10 aim to recover the service level once the OR backend processes the current state.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/missing units in-transit: 246 (P1: 62 units, P3: 184 units). Demand regime since P4 is stable at mean ~55 units/week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/04/29), we face a critical stockout situation. On-hand inventory is 0. The current In-transit total of 406 units consists of two confirmed lost shipments (P1: 62 units, P3: 184 units, total 246 lost) and one active order (P10: 160 units). Since the P10 order was placed 2 periods ago, it is expected to arrive during the Period 12 resolution phase and be visible in the Period 13 start. Demand has cooled from the early Feb anomaly, stabilizing around a mean of 55 units over the last 8 periods (P4-P11), with the last three periods showing a lower trend (73, 69, 46, 41, 37). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 246 lost units in the pipeline, I will set 'mu_hat' to a value that forces an order sufficient to cover demand while accounting for the fact that only 160 units are actually coming. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 captures the post-anomaly stability (mean ~53.6). I will use 'calculate' for L as the only successful arrival (P4) confirmed the promised lead time of 2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units are 406, which consists of: Period 1 (62 units - lost), Period 3 (184 units - lost), and Period 10 (160 units - expected to arrive during the Period 12 resolution phase, potentially becoming visible in the Period 13 conclude message). However, as of the start of Period 13, on-hand is still 0. Since the P10 order (160 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2, it should have arrived during Period 12. Its absence in the Period 12 conclude message suggests it is either delayed or also lost. Demand has shifted downward: from P4-P9 it averaged ~57 units, but the last three periods (P10-P12) averaged 41 units (41, 37, 45), indicating a cooling trend. I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this lower volume and set L=3 explicitly to account for the consistent pattern of shipment delays/losses seen in P1, P3, and now potentially P10, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher pipeline to compensate for the unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: avg decreased from ~57 to ~41 units/week over last 3 periods. Lead time reliability remains poor; P10 order (160 units) not visible by P13 start (actual lead time > 2).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/05/13), we have significant supply chain issues. On-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit of 406 units consists of: P1 (62 units - lost), P3 (184 units - lost), and P10 (160 units - overdue). The P10 order was placed in Period 10 with a promised lead time of 2 (should have arrived in P12, visible in P13); its absence at the start of P14 confirms the actual lead time is at least 4 periods or the shipment is lost. Demand has shifted downwards significantly starting at P10, averaging 38.5 units/week over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) compared to ~60 units/week previously. Given the extreme unreliability of lead times and likely lost shipments, I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the pipeline gap caused by lost units.

Carry-over insight: P10 shipment (160 units) confirmed overdue; actual lead time is >= 4 periods as of P14. Demand regime shift at Period 10 confirmed: mean demand dropped to ~39 units/week (down from ~57).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: The product is 'Jersey Basic Leggings'. Current status shows 0 on-hand inventory and a severe replenishment crisis. The In-transit total of 406 units consists of Period 1 (62), Period 3 (184), and Period 10 (160). Based on history, P1 and P3 orders (246 units) are confirmed lost. The P10 order is now significantly overdue (4 periods vs promised 2), indicating a systematic lead-time failure or further lost shipments. Regarding demand, since Period 10, the regime has shifted downward and stabilized: actual demand values are 41, 37, 45, 31, 45, averaging 39.8 units/week. To address the persistent out-of-stock condition and the unreliability of the pipeline, I am setting the lead time L to an explicit 4 to account for the observed delays and forcing a large order by using the recent 5-period demand mean (approx 40) for mu_hat. This will set a base stock level intended to cover the current demand regime while treating the 406 units in-transit as likely phantom inventory that the OR backend needs to ignore to trigger a new order.

Carry-over insight: Lead time unreliability persists: P10 order is at least 4 periods late (overdue). Demand regime stable at ~40 units/week since Period 10.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 16. The demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) shows a stable regime with a mean of 43.1. Although P15 saw a slight uptick to 60, the overall trend since mid-April is lower than the initial Q1 average. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 406 units. This 406 consists of P1 (62), P3 (184), and P10 (160). As documented, shipments from P1 and P3 are officially lost. The shipment from P10 ordered on 2019-04-15 is now 6 periods late (Lead Time >= 5, whereas promised is 2). This demonstrates severe lead-time unreliability. However, since the OR backend uses in-transit units to offset new orders, and the 406 units effectively block new replenishment, I must increase mu_hat and decrease L conceptually to force an order if necessary, or acknowledge that the in-transit units (even if lost) are preventing automated ordering. In this specific simulation logic, I will set L to 'explicit' 6 to reflect the current delay seen with P10, and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the stable 40-unit regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for P10 order confirmed as >= 5 periods (ordered P10, not arrived by P15 conclude). Demand regime P10-P15 stable at mean 43.1 units/week.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), the SKU 189634001 (Long Leg Leggings) is in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis indicates a significant breakdown in supply chain reliability: Period 1 (62 units) and Period 3 (184 units) shipments are confirmed lost. The Period 10 order (160 units) is now at least 6 periods late (ordered P10, not arrived by P16 conclude), meaning 'actual' lead time sits at >= 6 periods. The total in-transit of 406 units consists entirely of these three overdue/lost shipments. Per policy, the OR backend considers these units in its pipeline inventory, which prevents it from ordering new stock unless parameters are adjusted. To force a replenishment order, I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 6 to reflect observed delays. Demand has shifted slightly upward again after a dip; the last 3 periods (P14-P16) averaged 53 units/week. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=7, covering P10-P16) to capture the current stable demand regime (~45 units/week), which results in a base stock calculated against the real demand pattern while the increased L value allows the system to recognize the need for more coverage given the inventory 'black hole'.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for P10 order confirmed as >= 6 periods (ordered P10, not arrived by P16 conclude). Significant supply chain failure: 100% of current in-transit (406 units) is 4+ periods overdue.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, the supply chain for SKU 189634001 is functionally broken. The 'In-transit' quantity of 406 units consists of orders from P1 (62 units, 17 periods late), P3 (184 units, 15 periods late), and P10 (160 units, 8 periods late). None have arrived, and given the promised lead time of 2, these are logically lost. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is composed entirely of lost shipments, the OR backend sees a large pipeline and will not order unless parameters are adjusted. I must set 'L' to an explicit high value to force the backend to ignore the phantom 'In-transit' units and trigger a new order to meet current demand. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 43.6 units per week (P10-P17). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this specific regime. I will set L to an explicit value of 10 to reflect the severe delivery delays and bypass the pipeline cap.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain failure: 100% of pipeline (406 units) is lost/indefinitely delayed. Lead time for latest order (P10) is now confirmed as >= 8 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 189634001 has experienced a total failure. All historical pipeline inventory prior to Period 18 (406 units consisting of P1=62, P3=184, and P10=160) is confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, as the P10 order is now documented as >= 8 periods overdue. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 466 units is misleading; effectively, only the 60 units ordered in Period 18 are expected to arrive. The on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has transitioned to a lower-volume regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 42.1 units per week (periods 10-18). However, given that 100% of previous orders have failed to arrive for months, the actual lead time is non-deterministic. I am setting L to 8 (explicit) to account for the current age of the oldest missing shipment and force the OR backend to recognize that historical 'in-transit' units are effectively void. mu_hat is set to 42.1 * (1 + 8) = 378.9 using the recent 9-period mean to reflect the stabilized lower demand. sigma_hat is set based on the standard deviation of this same period to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: All orders from P1, P3, and P10 (406 units total) are considered lost/unrecoverable. Only orders from P18 onwards should be treated as active pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment has settled into a lower-volume regime since late April (Period 10), averaging approximately 42.5 units per week (periods 10-19). The supply chain has shown extreme unreliability; 406 units from orders in periods 1, 3, and 10 are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as they are significantly past any reasonable lead time. However, the order placed in Period 18 arrived in just 1 period (observed in P19 conclude), suggesting that while the backlog is lost, new orders might be fulfilling correctly. I will continue to treat the 406 units as lost for the purpose of the OR calculation. To stabilize the inventory according to the current demand regime, I am using a demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the recent lower-demand stabilization (approx 42-43 units/week) and a lead time (L) of 1 to reflect the most recent delivery success, while maintaining the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline logic for the OR engine's safety stock calculation to account for potential variance.

Carry-over insight: Recent shipment (P18) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, suggesting a possible shift in lead time reliability compared to previous lost shipments. Demand regime P10-P19 stabilized at a lower mean of ~42.5 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/01. The supply chain has recently shown a sign of recovery with the Period 18 order arriving in 1 period, although the historical 'In-transit' figure of 406 units remains composed entirely of lost shipments (P1, P3, P10). These 406 units are ignored as they counteract the OR backend's inventory balancing. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The demand regime has been stable since Period 10, averaging approximately 42.5 units/week. To ensure the backend places an order and covers the current demand, I am using 'explicit' L=1 (reflecting the most recent successful delivery) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=11, covering the stable regime since P10) and sigma_hat. This strategy ensures the system replenishes inventory immediately to meet the steady demand found in the 'Divided Basics' jersey leggings category during the summer months.

Carry-over insight: Recent shipment P18 confirmed a lead time shift to 1 period (previously 2 or lost). New demand regime since Period 10 is established at mean ~42.5 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189634001' (stretch leggings) is currently out of stock. The historical context shows a major supply chain breakdown where 406 units (from P1, P3, and P10) are lost or indefinitely delayed. Only the order from P18 arrived, with a lead time of 1 period, suggesting a possible improvement in logistics. Demand has shifted from ~55-60 units down to a stable lower regime of ~40 units/week since Period 10 (avg of last 12 periods is ~40.3). I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat to capture this current stable demand regime. I will set the lead time to an explicit '1' based on the most recent successful delivery (P18) to trigger replenishment, as the OR backend's default (2) might be too conservative given the current inventory deficit. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=12 to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 1 period for recent successful shipment (P18 order arrived P19).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P10-P22) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 41.5 units/week with low volatility. Although the promised lead time is 2, the most recent successful shipment (ordered P18, arrived P19) showed an actual lead time of 1 period. The existing 'In-transit' of 406 units consists entirely of lost orders from Period 1 (62), Period 3 (184), and Period 10 (160), as established in previous period insights. Since these units are considered unrecoverable, the OR backend needs to place a replenishment order. By setting L to 1, mu_hat to 83 (2 periods of demand), and sigma_hat to 10 (reflecting recent low variance), I prompt the engine to cover the current stockout. The profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) create a 50% service level target, which the OR engine will use to calculate the base stock. The pipeline inventory will be discounted by the backend because current on-hand and reliable pipeline is zero.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for the most recent successful order (P18) was 1 period, compared to promised 2. Demand regime P10-P22 is stable at a mean of 41.5 units/week.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is basic leggings, which typically exhibit stable demand. History shows a clear demand shift starting around Period 10; the mean demand from Period 10 to Period 23 is approximately 41.4 units/week, significantly lower than the early Jan/Feb volatility. The supply chain has been highly unreliable with orders from Periods 1, 3, and 10 (totaling 406 units) definitively lost/stuck in-transit, as they are now between 13 and 22 periods overdue. However, the most recent order (Period 18) arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period, suggesting that new orders might actually arrive while the old 'in-transit' units remain ghost inventory. To trigger a replenishment despite the 406 ghost units in pipeline, and accounting for the 1-period delivery observation, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=1 based on the most recent successful delivery. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*41 = 82 to match the established demand regime. I set sigma_hat to 10 to provide a buffer for the recent slight uptick in demand (Period 23 demand was 50). Using explicit parameters bypasses the OR engine's reliance on the 'In-transit' sum, which contains the 406 lost units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is basic jersey leggings. Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift around Period 10 (April 15). Before Period 10, demand averaged ~55-60 units; since Period 10 (the last 15 periods), demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 40.5 units/week. Lead time reliability is the primary concern: orders from P1, P3, and P10 (totaling 406 units) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, as they are now 14+ periods overdue. However, the most recent successful shipment (P18) arrived in 1 period. Given the massive 'In-transit' figure (406) which actually consists of lost inventory, the OR backend's inventory balancing will fail to order unless we explicitly adjust. Since the last order was P18 and we are at P25 with 0 on-hand, we need to re-prime the system. I will set mu_hat based on the stable 'recent_N' (N=15) demand since the shift. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to incorporate the recently observed 1-period arrival while moving away from the promised 2, but remain cautious due to historic losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 10 (stable for 15 periods) is mean 40.5 units/week. Pipeline units (406) are confirmed lost/unrecoverable; current stocking logic must bypass this pipeline figure to trigger new orders.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189634001' is currently at zero on-hand inventory and has not successfully received a shipment since Period 19. All 406 units currently in-transit (from P1, P3, and P10) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as they are many multiples of the promised lead time (2) or even the observed lead time (1) overdue. To trigger new orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the internal pipeline inventory calculation (OR backend formula: base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since the backend subtracts 406 units, I will set mu_hat to highly exceed this 'ghost' pipeline to ensure replenishment occurs. Based on the demand regime desde P10, the mean demand is approx 41.5 units/week. For a 2-period lead time (L=2) plus 1 review period, target demand coverage (mu_hat) would normally be ~125 (41.5 * 3). To offset the 406 lost units and actually place an order, I set mu_hat to 600. L is set to explicit 1 based on the most recent successful delivery (P18).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination: 406 units (P1, P3, P10) are permanently lost. Ordering requires significantly inflating mu_hat to overcome this negative pipeline balance in the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The OR backend uses a base-stock policy (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)). Currently, the system shows 600 units in-transit (P1: 62, P3: 184, P10: 160, P26: 194). Based on history, P1, P3, and P10 (406 units) are confirmed lost/unrecoverable. This ghost pipeline prevents the backend from placing new orders (as it assumes supply is coming). Since on-hand is 0 and demand is steady at ~40 units/week, we must force an order. To overcome the 406 lost units and the 194 unit order from P26 (which hasn't arrived yet), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock high enough to exceed the perceived 600-unit pipeline. With a mean demand of ~40 and lead time of 2, a normal base stock would be ~140. To trigger a replenishment of ~100 units now, I set mu_hat to 850 (600 pipeline + 100 desired + safety margin). This bypasses the pipeline contamination and ensures we don't stock out for another several periods while waiting for P26 to arrive (if it does).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: Inventory is 0 with a 'ghost' pipeline of 406 lost units (P1, P3, P10). Total in-transit is 850, consisting of the 406 lost units and recent orders: P26 (194) and P27 (250). Lead time is treated as 2 (promised), though P18 arrived in 1. Current demand regime (P10-P27) is stable with a mean of ~41.7. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (850) from the base stock calculation, a standard mu_hat (~125 for L=2) results in 0 orders, extending the stockout. To force an order and bypass the 406 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired base_stock is ~180 (4 periods of coverage considering potential volatility). To counteract the -406 pipeline effect and still generate an order around 200 units, mu_hat is set explicitly to 850 (pipeline) + 180 (desired buffer) = 1030. This ensures the backend sees a 'deficit' and places a fresh order to replenish the stockout.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29. The product is jersey basic leggings. Demand has remained relatively stable since Period 10, averaging ~42 units/week, with a recent slight uptick in the last 3 weeks (avg 53). The 'In-transit' balance of 1030 units is heavily contaminated by lost shipments: orders from P1 (62), P3 (184), and P10 (160) totaling 406 units are confirmed lost. Subtracting 406 from the current 1030 leaves 624 units potentially 'active' (orders from P26-P28). However, because the OR backend policy uses 'order = base_stock - pipeline', the presence of the 406 'ghost' units prevents new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 and mean demand of ~45 (reflecting recent slight growth) as: (1+L) * mu = 3 * 45 = 135. Adding the 406 lost units to this target yields an explicit mu_hat of 541. This ensures that even after the backend subtracts the 1030 in-transit units, it sees a need to maintain local stock once actual arrivals clear the relevant portion of the pipeline. I'm keeping sigma_hat at recent levels (N=10) to account for recent demand volatility (range 28-64).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant reliability issues. The 'in-transit' total of 1030 units is heavily contaminated by historically lost orders (P1, P3, P10 totaling 406 units) and recent orders from P26, P27, and P28 which have not yet arrived. Specifically, the order from P26 (194 units) is now at least 4 periods overdue (ordered P26, not arrived by P29 conclude), confirming that the Lead Time shift to 1 period seen in Period 18 was an anomaly. Current actual Lead Time is at least 4. Demand remains stable in the low 40s-50s; the mean demand from Period 20 to 29 is 43.7 units/week. Since the OR backend subtracts the full (contaminated) pipeline of 1030 units from its base stock calculation, and we have 0 on-hand inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to overcome this negative balance and force a replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to 1200 effectively signals a target inventory level that accounts for the 1000+ units the system thinks are coming but likely aren't, ensuring we maintain a high service level for this jersey basic as we enter September.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reliability has regressed: P26 order (194 units) is >= 4 periods overdue as of P30. Pipeline contamination now totals at least 600 units (406 legacy + 194 from P26).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189634001 has experienced significant supply chain instability. Period 30 saw the arrival of shipments from Period 27 (LT=3) and Period 28 (LT=2), resulting in an on-hand inventory of 386 units. However, we have a massive 'lost' pipeline. Historical records (P1: 62, P3: 184, P10: 160, and likely P26: 194) account for 600 units in the 'In-transit' figure (current total 770) that are significantly overdue and likely unrecoverable. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock. With an on-hand inventory of 386 and a contaminated pipeline of 770, the perceived inventory position is ~1156. At a demand of ~45 units/week, the backend will not order for many periods unless the mu_hat is dramatically inflated to 'offset' the lost 600 units. Demand since Period 10 has remained stable around 42-45 units/week. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for (1+L) base demand plus an offset to neutralize the ghost pipeline and target a safe stock level, while setting L=2 to reflect the average of the most recent successful arrivals (P27/P28).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination totals ~600 units (P1, P3, P10, and P26) which are overdue and likely lost. Effective ordering requires bypassing this pipeline by inflating mu_hat. Recent lead times have returned to approximately 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-268.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant supply chain disruption. In-transit inventory includes 600 units (62+184+160+194) from Periods 1, 3, 10, and 26 that are confirmed lost or severely overdue. Currently, only the 170 units ordered in Period 30 are realistically in the pipeline. With On-hand inventory at 327 units and demand stable around 45-50 units per week, there is sufficient stock for the immediate term. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive (but fake) pipeline of 770 units and thus failing to order when needed, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. This helps offset the 'ghost inventory' until the system clears it. Since current stock (327) covers approximately 6-7 periods of demand and the pipeline is contaminated, I will set parameters to maintain a safety buffer without triggering excessive overstocking, while acknowledging that the lead time has recently settled between 2 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination update: 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26) are confirmed lost/unrecoverable. Observed lead times for successful deliveries (P27, P28) were 2-3 periods.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189634001 currently has 437 units on-hand. The pipeline (in-transit) of 600 units is confirmed lost/unrecoverable based on multiple periods of history (P1, P3, P10, and P26 orders). Demand has seen a slight uptick in the last three periods (P30-P32: 44, 59, 60), averaging 54.3 units, compared to the mean of ~42 units seen between P10 and P29. While recent lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods (P27: LT=3, P28: LT=2, P30: LT=2), the high on-hand inventory relative to demand dictates a holding position. Current on-hand covers approximately 8 periods of demand. No new order is needed. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 'contaminated' pipeline of 600 and erroneously refraining from ordering in the future, I will continue to monitor the necessity of inflating mu_hat. However, with 437 units on-hand and demand around 55, the current priority is to avoid excessive holding costs. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time of successful deliveries (approx 2).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P30-P32) shows a slight increase to ~54 units/week from the previous ~42 units/week regime. Lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized between 2-3 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 189634001 has shown a significant upward trend in recent periods (P30-P33), with the most recent demand spike reaching 109 units. This suggests a potential seasonal shift or late-September peak for 'Divided Basics' jersey leggings. The background demand regime, previously around 42 units/week, has shifted to approximately 68 units/week based on the last 4 periods (44, 59, 60, 109). Lead times for successful deliveries (P27, P28, P30) have stabilized at 2-3 periods, although a massive 'pipeline contamination' of 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26) remains in the system effectively as dead units. With on-hand inventory at 328 units and considering the high recent demand, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation overcomes the phantom pipeline (600 units) and targets a safety level covering the anticipated higher demand. I've set mu_hat based on (1+L) * 70 units/week to maintain a robust stock position during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 30: Average demand increased from ~42 to ~68 units/week based on P30-P33 data (+60% shift). Pipeline contamination confirmed at 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26 orders are lost).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Long Leg Leggings' has shifted significantly starting around Period 30. Recent demand (P30-P34) shows values of 44, 59, 60, 109, and 54, indicating an upward trend/seasonal spike (October context) compared to the prior baseline of ~42. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 65 units/week. Lead times for successful deliveries (P27, P28, P30) have been 3, 2, and 2 periods respectively, averaging 2.33. However, there is massive pipeline contamination: 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26) are confirmed lost/unrecoverable but still appear in the 'In-transit' total. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, the presence of these 600 phantom units will prevent any new orders from being placed even when on-hand inventory is depleted. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the 600 lost units to the required base stock calculation: (Expected Lead Time + 1) * Forecasted Demand + Lost Units = (2 + 1) * 65 + 600 = 795. This forces the system to recognize the need for new units despite the contaminated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Average increased to ~65 units/week (P30-P34) from previous ~42. Pipeline contamination confirmed at 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26) which are lost and must be bypassed in ordering logic.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/14. I am monitoring SKU 189634001, which has experienced a demand shift starting around Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to 35 is approximately 68.2 units, a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~42 units. This shift likely coincides with seasonal patterns for 'Leggings in stretch jersey' as we enter the autumn season. Regarding supply chain, the in-transit value of 600 units is confirmed 'pipeline contamination'\u2014these units (from P1, P3, P10, and P26) are long overdue and lost. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_inventory. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*68.2 + 600 = 804.6. This forces the base stock level high enough to offset the 600 'in-transit' units and cover 3 periods of the new demand regime. For sigma_hat, I'll use the recent regime (P30-P35, N=6) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Average increased to ~68 units/week (P30-P35) from ~42, likely seasonal. Pipeline contamination fixed at 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26) which are lost; ordering logic must use explicit mu_hat inflation of +600 to bypass this.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-10-21. Demand has shifted significantly since Period 30, averaging approximately 68.2 units per week (P30-P36: 44, 59, 60, 109, 54, 83, 64) compared to the previous regime of ~42. This increase is likely seasonal (autumn in the Northern Hemisphere) for jersey leggings. A critical operational issue exists: 600 units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P10, and P26) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, as they have not arrived despite substantial time elapsed (e.g., P26 is now 11 periods overdue). These units 'contaminate' the OR backend's inventory calculations by making the pipeline look overstuffed, which prevents the system from placing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level by exactly 600 units. The base target is $(1+L) \times \text{Forecast}$. With $L=2$ (promised and recently observed) and a forecast of 68, the base $\mu$ is $204$. Adding the 600 lost units results in an explicit $\mu$ of 804. This forces the system to order despite the ghost inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189634001 (Divided Basics Leggings) is currently in a higher demand regime that started around Period 30 (September), likely reflecting seasonal demand for jersey basics in autumn. The average demand since Period 30 is approximately 63 units/week (P30-P37: 44, 59, 60, 109, 54, 83, 64, 42). A significant 'pipeline contamination' exists: 600 units from early periods (P1, P3, P10, P26) are confirmed lost/unrecoverable but still appear in the system's 'In-transit' total. To trigger an order despite this 600-unit ghost inventory, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory level. Calculation: Base Stock = (L+1) * \u03bc. With L=2, (2+1) * 63 = 189 units. To offset the 600 lost units in the pipeline, the target must be elevated to ~789. mu_hat will be set to 800 to ensure the backend places an order to replenish the thinning on-hand stock (85 units) and cover upcoming demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering November, a period typically associated with high demand for basics like leggings due to colder weather and upcoming retail peaks. Recent demand (P30-P38) has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 57 units/week compared to the previous regime. Total in-transit is 715 units, but 600 of these (from orders P1, P3, P10, and P26) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue, causing a 'pipeline contamination' that prevents the OR backend from ordering. To correct this, I am using an explicit mu_hat that covers the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods plus an offset of 600 units to bypass the lost pipeline units. With L=2, the required base stock is (3 * 57) + 600 \u2248 771 units. I set sigma_hat slightly higher to provide a buffer for the observed demand volatility (ranging from 42 to 109).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P30-P38 stable at mean ~57 units/week. Pipeline contamination confirmed at 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26) which are permanently lost and must be bypassed via mu_hat inflation.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for these jersey leggings is in a stable seasonal regime (Period 30-39) with a mean of 56.7 units/week. The total in-transit quantity of 715 units includes 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26) that are confirmed lost/overdue by many periods and will not arrive. Only 115 units (P38, P39) are active in the pipeline. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 715 units of pipeline from its target stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass this 600-unit discrepancy. Target base stock = (L+1) * mu + safety_stock. With L=2, mu=57, and standard safety stock, the base stock would be ~230. However, to net out the -600 pipeline error, I must set the 'mu_hat' parameter manually to cover both the desired stocking level and the lost units. I set mu_hat (target stock) to 840 (approximately 230 target + 600 lost units + small buffer) to trigger an order that maintains availability as on-hand (7) is nearly depleted.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination remains constant at 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26). Demand regime P30-P39 is stable at ~57 units/week. Lead times for successful deliveries (P27, P28, P30, P36) range between 2-3 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory is heavily contaminated by 600 units from legacy lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P26), which the OR backend still considers 'in-transit'. To bypass this and force an order that covers immediate demand, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter significantly. Recent demand (P30-P40) has stabilized at a mean of 58.2 units/week with moderate volatility. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, the target service level is 50%. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of real demand (3 * 58.2 = 174.6) plus the 600-unit pipeline offset, totaling 774.6. This ensures the OR logic [max(0, base_stock - pipeline)] results in a positive order. Observed lead times for successful deliveries (P27, P28, P30, P36) range from 2 to 3 periods, so I will used a calculated lead time approach. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the variance of the current demand regime since the seasonal shift at Period 30.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a persistent supply chain issue: a total of 600 units (from orders in Periods 1, 3, 10, and 26) are confirmed lost/unrecoverable. This 'ghost' pipeline prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from triggering new orders because it believes 'In-transit' inventory is sufficient. To bypass this, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by the total lost units (600). The underlying demand since Period 30 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 57 units per week. Therefore, the base forecast for a 3-period window (Review + Promised LT of 2) is 3 * 57 = 171. Adding the 600-unit pipeline offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 771. On-hand is currently 0, and the P38 order (101 units) and P40 order (118 units) are the only valid pipeline items. Recent successful lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods, so I will use 'calculate' for L. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=11, covering the Period 30 shift) to capture the current demand volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 42 was 175, likely a Black Friday surge (Nov 25th-Dec 2nd context). The demand regime from P30-P41 averaged 53.3, but the P42 spike requires immediate reaction. Lead times for recent orders (P36, P39) were 3 and 2 periods respectively, but orders from P38 (101 units) and P40 (118 units) are currently undelivered and should arrive by P43/P44. The pipeline contamination remains at 600 units (P1, P3, P10, P26 orders are lost). Total in-transit is 819, so active pipeline is 219 (819 - 600). To bypass the 600 units of 'phantom' inventory in the OR's base-stock calculation, mu_hat must be inflated. Calculating mu_hat: Promised L=2. Review+L=3. Base demand \u2248 60. Seasonal boost for Dec: 1.5x. Expected demand per week \u2248 90. Target Inventory = (1+L)*90 + safety. This is roughly 300 units. To trigger this despite 600 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 900. I use explicit 900 for mu_hat and 100 for sigma_hat to ensure a robust order size while accounting for the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 175 (3.3x recent average). Demand regime remains elevated post-seasonal events.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44, entering the post-Cyber Monday/early December period. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 175 (Black Friday) and remained elevated at 116 in Period 43. The current average demand since the seasonal shift at P30 (excluding the extreme P42 spike) is approximately 60.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is nearly zero (2 units). The pipeline is severely contaminated with 600 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P26), which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation. To force an order and bypass this 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the contaminated pipeline + on-hand inventory. The required base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=3 periods at ~60 units/week is roughly 180 units. However, because the backend sees 782 units in transit (600 lost + 101 from P38 + 81 from P43), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to 950 to ensure a meaningful replenishment order of approximately 150-200 units is generated this period to prevent stockouts during the holiday season. L and sigma_hat are kept as 'calculate' and 'recent_N' to reflect observed volatility and mean lead time of ~2.5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand remains elevated above previous baseline; P43 demand was 116 units vs pre-seasonal ~57 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019/12/16), the system faces a massive pipeline contamination of 600 units (Orders from P1, P3, P10, and P26) which are confirmed lost or overdue by several months. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', so these 600 'ghost' units prevent the system from placing necessary orders. Currently, On-hand is 0. Demand has transitioned from the Black Friday peak (P42: 175, P43: 116) to post-event stabilization (P44: 30). I have two orders (P43: 81 units, P44: 166 units) in the valid pipeline, but they won't arrive until P45/P46. To force an order today and clear the stockout, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the 600 lost units. I set mu_hat to 900, which accounts for the 600 units of lost pipeline plus roughly 300 units of expected demand and safety stock over the upcoming (L+1) periods (3 periods with lead time 2).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand reflects significant seasonal volatility surrounding the Black Friday and December holiday periods (P42: 175, P43: 116, P45: 166). We are currently at Period 46 (Dec 23), right at the Christmas peak. The pipeline is heavily contaminated with 600 units of legacy lost orders (P1, P3, P10, P26) which the OR backend still considers 'in-transit'. This necessitates using an explicit 'mu_hat' that adds approximately 600 units to the expected demand for the lead time sequence to bypass the negative pipeline logic and trigger an order. The current demand baseline has elevated to approximately 100 units/week during this peak period. With a lead time (L) of 2-3 periods, the required base stock (Review+L) is roughly 4 periods of demand. Calculating mu_hat: (4 periods * 100 units/period) + 600 offset = 1000. Sigma is set high to account for the extreme holiday spikes observed.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P42-P45) shows spikes of 2x-3x baseline (up to 175 units). Pipeline contamination remains at 600 units of unrecoverable stock.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in a post-holiday demand phase. Recent demand (P42-P46) has been extremely high and volatile due to seasonal events (Black Friday, holidays), with values of 175, 116, 30, 166, and 121. The pipeline is heavily contaminated with 600 units (P1: 62, P3: 184, P10: 160, P26: 194) that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1000 units likely consists of these 600 lost units plus more recent orders (P44: 166, P46: 133, and potentially others). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 600 units. Additionally, recent successful lead times have averaged 2.5 periods (P40: 3, P43: 2). For the demand forecast, I am using a recent window of 5 periods (P42-P46) which captures the high holiday volatility, resulting in an average weekly demand of ~121.6 units. To bypass the 600 lost units, I set an explicit mu_hat of (1+L)*121.6 + 600. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 121.6 + 600 \u2248 965. This ensures the backend triggers an order despite the 600 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline.
