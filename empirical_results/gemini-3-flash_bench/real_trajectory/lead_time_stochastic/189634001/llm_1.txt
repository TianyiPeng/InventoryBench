  "rationale": "Product 189634001 is identified as basic jersey leggings, a staple item likely to have relatively stable demand but influenced by the transition into spring in mid-February. Historical demand shows an average of approximately 52.8 units (54, 60, 52, 52, 46). The most recent period (Feb 4) showed a dip to 46, but I will anchor my forecast around the 53-unit average. Current status: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive at the start of Period 3 for availability in Period 4. I must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 until that shipment arrives, plus maintain a safety stock. Total expected demand for 3 periods (~160 units) plus a buffer for potential lead time variance or demand spikes (aiming for roughly 4 periods of coverage to be safe given 0 starting inventory and $1 profit vs $1 holding cost).

However, P1 saw a massive spike to 201 (Valentine's/pre-Spring?), while P2 dropped to 77. The average across all 7 known data points is approx 77 units. I will forecast a base demand of ~80 units. c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. The P1 order (210 units) is expected to arrive during P3 (visible in P4). The P2 order (400 units) is expected to arrive during P4 (visible in P5). Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory meaning P1 and P2 sales were lost. d) Inventory Assessment: Total In-transit is 610.

P1 order (210) arrives this period but settles after my decision; it should cover P3 demand (est 80) and leave ~130 for P4. P2's 400 arrives in P4, bringing inventory high.

However, Period 1 (late Feb) saw a spike to 201 units, followed by stabilization at 77 (P2) and 57 (P3). The spike in P1 was likely a seasonal or one-off event. Average demand excluding the spike is ~50-60 units. I am currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have lost all demand from Periods 1-3 (total 335 units). Lead time is promised at 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (210), P2 (400), P3 (0). According to the 'Period N conclude' logic, the P1 order should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests the P1 order (210 units) is delayed or the actual lead time is >= 3. If lead time is 3, the P1 order should arrive during Period 4 (visible P5). Total in-transit is 610. If I assume demand is ~60/week, I need to cover Period 4, 5, and 6 (L+1 = 3 periods). 3 * 60 = 180 units. I have 610 in the pipeline. Even if some orders are lost, the 610 units currently in-transit (Orders from P1 and P2) are far higher than my immediate 3-period need.

(c) Lead Time: P2 order arrived in P4, confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods.

Pre-game history (Jan) also showed stability (46-60 range). Current forecast: ~60 units/period. c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. Period 2 order (400) arrived in Period 4 (W=2).

There's a slight uptick in the most recent period (73), possibly early spring seasonal interest, but the mean roughly stays around 55-60 units. b) Demand regime analysis: Average demand over the last 4 periods is (50+60+48+73)/4 = 57.75. c) Lead time: Confirmed at 2 periods. Order from P1 (210 units) is definitely lost. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 169. In-transit is 210 units (placed in Period 8's view, though history doesn't show a specific order in P7, the 'In-transit' field reports 210 units). If the lead time is 2, those 210 units should arrive in Period 9 or 10. e) Order logic: We need to cover (L+1) periods (3 periods). Demand for 3 periods at ~60/period is 180 units. On-hand (169) + In-transit (210) = 379. This is significantly above the required inventory for the next 3 weeks. However, looking at the 'In-transit' data, if that 210 is actually the 'ghost' of the lost P1 order and not a new order, I risk stockout. But the system explicitly lists 'In-transit: 210'. Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), overstocking is as penalizing as stockouts.

Order placed in P8 (50 units) is expected to arrive in P10. There is 260 units in-transit. Let's trace back the in-transit: P8 ordered 50 (In-transit), and since total in-transit is 260, there must be 210 units previously ordered. Reviewing history: P1 ordered 210, which never arrived and was flagged as 'likely lost' in P5 insight. However, the system still lists 'In-transit: 260', confirming the P1 order (210) + P8 order (50) makes up the total. Since P1 has been missing for 8 periods (L=2), those 210 units are definitely lost and should be ignored for inventory calculations. d) Inventory Assessment: Current On-hand = 100.
