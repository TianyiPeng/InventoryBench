Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 399223033 (Jeggings). Initial status shows 0 inventory on-hand and in-transit. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks shows a recent spike: the first 4 weeks (Jan 7 to Jan 28) averaged ~121.75 units, while the most recent week (Feb 4) jumped to 161 units. This suggests a potential upward trend as we move into the spring retail season for ladies' denim. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to weigh the recent higher demand more heavily than the full history, while still maintaining some stability. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of the entire available history. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as we have no delivery history yet to justify a deviation from the promised 2 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. In Period 1, we ordered 161 units (based on the Feb 4th sample), but demand came in much higher at 186 units, resulting in 186 units of lost sales because starting on-hand was 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods, so the order placed in Period 1 (161 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 161 in-transit. The demand samples (126, 120, 128, 113, 161) plus the actual Period 1 demand of 186 suggest an increasing trend or a higher baseline than the initial samples indicated. The average demand of the 5 samples was ~128.6, but the most recent two (161, 186) average 173.5. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture this upward shift, setting N=3 to include the 161 and 186 data points. For lead time, I will stick to the default promised L=2 as we have no 'conclude' messages yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is Jeggings, a basic staple item. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (161 units) and Period 2 (215 units) are currently in-transit (Total 376). Following the lead-time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 3) and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for the first two periods because starting inventory was 0. Demand history shows values: 126, 120, 128, 113, 161. The high demand in Period 1 (186) and Period 2 (134) suggests a slight upward trend or seasonality as we move further into February. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5) to capture the recent mean of ~130, and default for lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 2 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Jeggings (Ladies Denim), a staple fashion item. Historical demand (pre-game) averaged 129.6 units over 5 samples. Game history (P1-P3) shows demand of 186, 134, and 111 (avg 143.6). Current status: 0 on-hand, 516 in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) should arrive during Period 3's arrival window and be confirmed in the Period 3 conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, suggesting the Period 1 order is either delayed or the lead time is longer than 2. If it arrives in Period 4, the actual lead time is 3. I will set L to 3 (explicitly) to account for this observed delay and ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the game period samples (avg ~144) rather than the lower pre-game samples to avoid stockouts once inventory arrives.

Carry-over insight: Lead time potentially 3 periods (Period 1 order not arrived by Period 3 conclude, expected arrival Period 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1665.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019-03-11), we see the first arrival: 215 units from Period 2 arrived after 2 periods. Critically, the Period 1 order (161 units) has NOT arrived by the end of Period 4, despite a promised lead time of 2. This strongly suggests the Period 1 shipment is lost. Inventory currently shows 121 on-hand (from Period 2's arrival minus Period 4's demand). Total in-transit is 487 (Periods 1, 3, 4). Since the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2), the lead time remains 2. However, the loss of the Period 1 shipment creates a supply gap that the OR backend, which assumes all orders arrive, will underestimate. To compensate for the lost 161 units from Period 1 and ensure coverage for the next 3 periods (L+1), I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Historical demand average is ~130. I'll use a slightly higher forecast (145) to build a safety buffer due to the lost initial shipment, resulting in mu_hat = 3 * 145 = 435. \u03c3\u0302 is set using the standard deviation of recent demand (~35), scaled by sqrt(3) \u2248 1.73, giving ~60.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 shipment (161 units) likely lost: did not arrive by Period 4 conclude while Period 2 shipment arrived on time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing 'Jeggings H.W'. Current on-hand is 39 units with 487 in transit. Demand has stabilized post-February (Feb avg ~140, March avg ~88) suggesting a return to baseline or a slight seasonal dip after the Valentine's/Early Spring period. Lead time analysis: Period 2's order arrived exactly in 2 periods (Period 4 conclude). Period 1's order (placed P1, promised arrival P3/P4) is officially confirmed as lost, as P5 conclude shows no arrival and P4 conclude skipped it. Period 3's order (140 units) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 6 START), as its lead time is 2 periods. To set parameters, I will use a recent_N (N=4) for demand to reflect the current lower demand regime (avg 105) compared to the initial samples. Lead time will remain at the default of 2 since the only successful shipment adhered to it. Parameters aim to maintain enough safety stock to cover the 3-period coverage window (L+1) without over-ordering given the recent demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting March (Period 4): avg decreased from ~140 to ~88. Period 1 shipment (161 units) confirmed lost (missing after P4/P5 concludes while P2 arrived).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-3 average was ~144 units, while the recent 3 periods (P4-P6) show a lower average of ~91 units (94, 82, 97). The inventory is currently 0 with a significant in-transit pipeline (487 units), but the Period 1 order (161 units) is confirmed lost, as the later Period 2 order arrived in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2, and the Period 2 order arrived exactly in 2 periods. Therefore, I will use L=2. To capture the recent lower demand trend, I'll set N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the post-shift periods P4-P6). Setting mu_hat to the recent average accounts for the current demand level, while the pipeline already has orders from P3 and P4 (140+186=326 units plus potentially the lost 161 which the OR engine sees as in-transit); by setting parameters properly, the OR engine will determine if additional units are needed despite the 'ghost' inventory from the lost Period 1 shipment.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). Examining history, the Period 1 order (161 units) is officially confirmed lost as it has significantly exceeded the promised 2-period lead time, while the Period 2 order arrived correctly at Period 4. The demand pattern has been volatile: initial demand in February (P1-P3) averaged ~143, dropped significantly in March (P4-P6) to ~91, but then spiked massively to 258 in Period 7 (March 25th). This P7 spike likely corresponds to a pre-Easter shopping surge (Easter 2019 was April 21st). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 487 units in-transit (orders from P3 and P4). To recover from the stockout and the lost Period 1 shipment, I am setting L to explicit 2 (promised) since P2 arrived correctly. For mu_hat, the recent demand volatility (94, 82, 97, 258) suggests a shift; I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this combined lower period and the recent spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the significantly increased volatility observed in the last 4 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in late March (Period 7: demand 258 vs previous 4-week avg ~90), likely due to seasonal Easter shopping effects.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Reviewing the history: demand for this SKU (Jeggings) showed a baseline of ~140, dipped to ~90 in early March, but spiked significantly to 258 and 174 in the last two periods (late March/early April). This aligns with the pre-Easter shopping window (Easter 2019 was April 21st). We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) with 637 units in transit. The Period 1 shipment (161 units) is officially considered lost as shipments from Period 2 have long since arrived. Lead time remains confirmed at 2 periods. To capture the current seasonal spike and high volatility, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the surge (Periods 6, 7, 8: 97, 258, 174; avg ~176) and explicit sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed during this transition into the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed: Late March/Early April demand (avg ~216) is significantly higher than early March (avg ~90) due to Easter seasonality. High volatility observed during this transition.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), we are likely moving past the Easter peak (Easter Sunday was April 21, 2019). Historical samples and game history show high volatility: demand since Period 7 includes 258, 174, and 104. The Period 9 drop to 104 suggests the peak shopping burst might be subsiding, but demand remains higher than the early March regime (avg ~88). Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand, 760 in-transit) due to a confirmed lost shipment from Period 1 and a series of stockouts during the Easter surge. Because the pipeline is large (760 units compared to recent weekly demand of 104-258), the OR engine's capped policy will likely limit new ordering. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the elevated post-peak demand (avg ~178 per week) while L remains at the promised 2. For sigma_hat, N=3 captures the high variance observed during the seasonal shift to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to recover from stockouts once arrivals resume.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22) is post-Easter (Easter Sunday was April 21). Demand history shows a significant peak during the pre-Easter shopping periods (Period 7: 258, Period 8: 174) and a cooling-off period (Period 9: 104, Period 10: 89). The product is 'Jeggings', which typically settles into a stable replenishment demand after seasonal peaks. The average demand of the last two weeks (96.5) is consistent with the pre-peak regime (P4-P6 average: 91). I am setting L to 'default' as recent shipments (P8, P9) have arrived within or faster than the promised 2-period lead time. Mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak demand trend (avg ~94 per period), while ignoring the extreme Easter spike. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to incorporate the recent volatility within the forecast window to ensure a sufficient service level for the high-margin product (Profit $19 vs Holding $1). Pipeline inventory is healthy at 487 units, but base stock needs to reflect the transition back to normal levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-Easter demand stabilization confirmed: Weekly demand has returned to the ~90-100 range (Period 9-10 avg: 96.5) following the late March peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019 (Period 12). The product is 'Jeggings', which experienced a significant demand spike during the Easter season (late March/early April). Historical evidence and carry-over insights confirm that the surge has ended. Demand in the most recent periods (P10 and P11) was 89 and 119 respectively, averaging approximately 104 units. This aligns with the post-Easter stabilization insight. The pipeline inventory is high (487 units) due to recent large orders. Lead times have stabilized back to 2 periods or less based on the Period 10 arrival message. I will set L to the promised 2 periods (default). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 (approximate demand for P9, P10, and P11) to capture the current stable regime while discarding the extreme volatility of the Easter peak episodes. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the current post-peak standard deviation, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-buffer for a seasonal variance that has passed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-06 (Period 13). We are out of stock (on-hand: 0) after Period 12 demand (111) exceeded on-hand inventory (65). Historical demand data and carry-over insights show that the Easter seasonal peak has passed. Demand has stabilized into a post-holiday regime. The last four periods (9, 10, 11, 12) show demand of 104, 89, 119, and 111, respectively, giving an average of 105.75 units per period. This shift is distinct from the volatile late March surge. Lead time analysis shows the promised lead time remains 2 periods, though we recently saw a 1-period arrival (P9 order), suggesting lead times are generally stable or shorter than promised. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized post-Easter demand (~106 units/period). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current volatility while ignoring the Easter spike.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. We have entered a post-Easter stabilization phase (Demand Regime 3). Historical data for the current regime (Periods 9-13) shows demands of 104, 89, 119, 111, and 115. The mean of these 5 samples is 107.6 with a low standard deviation. Our on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 487 units in-transit (ordered in recent periods but not yet arrived). Specifically, orders from P12 and P13 are expected to arrive in P14 and P15 respectively (assuming L=2). Since we have 0 on-hand and were unable to satisfy 115 units of demand in P13 (resulting in 0 ending inventory), we must rely on the incoming pipeline. Given that demand has stabilized around 107.6, I will use recent_N (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Although we had a missed shipment in Period 1, the lead time has mostly trended back to the promised 2 periods, so I will use L=default.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/20. We are in a post-Easter period where demand has stabilized following the late March/early April peak. Analyzing the last 5 periods (Periods 10-14), demand has been 89, 119, 111, 115, and 144, averaging approximately 115.6. This is slightly higher than the ~90-100 observed immediately after the peak, suggesting a moderate upward trend as we move further into the season. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 487 units in-transit. Although the 'In-transit' count is high, our history shows that shipments can be lost (Period 1 order) or arrive in bundles (Period 10). The OR engine needs to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. With a promised lead time of 2, we should cover 3 periods of demand (~347 units). Since we have 487 units in-transit according to reality (and on-hand is 0), the OR system (which uses base_stock - pipeline) will likely not order more if it believes the pipeline is full. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent average of 115.6 (3 periods = 346.8), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the current post-holiday volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' as recent successful arrivals (Period 10) confirmed the promised 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Easter (Periods 10-14) has stabilized at a higher baseline, averaging ~116 versus the previous ~95, indicating a gradual seasonal growth.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is Jeggings, a staple item. Current inventory is critically low (on-hand: 0) with a large in-transit pipeline (487 units), which should bridge the stockout once it arrives. Looking at the demand history, we have moved past the Easter peak (late March/early April). Analysis of the last 6 periods (Periods 10-15) shows demand has stabilized at a higher baseline following the initial post-Easter drop. The mean demand over these 6 periods is approximately 117 (89, 119, 111, 115, 144, 128), which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 15. The promised lead time is 2, and while there was one instance of a 1-period delivery, the standard lead time remains 2. To cover the current inventory gap and account for the new demand baseline, I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat (demand) and sigma_hat (volatility) to reflect this stabilized post-Easter regime (N=min(6, 20)).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Historical demand since mid-May (Period 14-16) has shown a significant upward shift, averaging ~135 units (144, 128, 132) compared to the previous stabilization at ~116. This aligns with early summer seasonality for denim jeggings. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 487 units in-transit (presumably from the order placed in Period 1 when the 161 units were lost, or perhaps more recent logic applied by the OR backend). However, despite the large 'in-transit' figure, actual arrivals have been zero for 6 consecutive periods (P11-P16), resulting in sustained stockouts. Lead time has historically been 2 periods (P2 arrived P4, P8 arrived P10), but many early orders (P1, P3, P4) never arrived or were effectively lost. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent demand increase (~135 units/period) and L=2 (promised) to trigger replenishment, as the backend needs to reconcile the 0 on-hand state with the theoretical 'pipeline'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 14 (Late May): average demand increased from ~116 to ~135 (+16%), likely due to early summer seasonality.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 10, mid-summer. Recent historical evidence (Period 14-16) showed a sustained demand level around 135 units, though Period 17 dropped to 66 (likely an outlier or start of a shift). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 487 units in-transit. Since no orders have been placed recently, the 487 in-transit units likely represent a bulk replenishment recently triggered by the OR backend. Lead time has generally been consistent at 2 periods (except for one lost shipment and one 1-period arrival). I will use the recent_N method for lead time (N=3) to account for recent reliability. For demand (mu_hat), the most recent regime (P14-P17) averages ~117.5. Given we are in the summer season for Jeggings, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this post-May baseline while tempering the P17 dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed in early June: Period 17 demand (66) is significantly lower than the preceding 3-week average (~135), requiring monitoring for a new downward regime shift.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P17: 66, P18: 81) confirms a significant downward shift in demand compared to the late-May/early-June average (~135). The average demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) is approximately 101.75. Given this recent drop, I am shifting from the previously higher summer estimate to a more conservative recent average (N=4) for mu_hat. This accounts for the potential end of a seasonal peak or a cooling trend in June demand for this SKU. Lead time is kept at the promised 2 periods (L=2) based on past successful arrivals (P4, P10). With 487 units currently in-transit and zero on-hand inventory, the supply pipeline is significant. Setting params with N=4 allows the backend to level out order quantities against the recent volatility and high pipeline inventory, prioritizing the current lower demand trend to avoid overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: Weekly demand decreased from ~135 to ~73 over the last two periods (P17-18), a drop of ~46%, indicating the early summer peak may have concluded.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand has shifted down significantly over the last three periods (P17-P19: 66, 81, 44), averaging 63.7 units. This confirms the insight from Period 19 that the early summer peak has ended and a lower demand regime is now in effect. The product is jeggings, which often face a mid-summer lull. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 487 units in-transit (ordered over previous periods, though many appear potentially lost or significantly delayed given the history). Since the demand regime has recently changed, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower volume and variance (63.7 mean). This prevents the base stock from being inflated by the higher May/early June demand. For lead time, I'll stick with default as the backend computes based on promised (2) but there's high volatility in actual arrivals (P1 lost, P9 came in 1 period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: avg demand dropped from ~135 to ~64 (-52%) for P17-P19, signaling a mid-summer seasonal low.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering Period 21 (July 1st), which corresponds to high summer. Historically, demand began a sharp decline around Period 17 (June 3rd), dropping from a late-May average of ~135 to a mid-summer low averaging ~55 over the last 4 periods (P17: 66, P18: 81, P19: 44, P20: 29). This aligns with seasonal trends for denim jeggings as consumers shift toward lighter summer apparel. Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, but there are 487 units in-transit. Given the recent demand drop, these 487 units (which are significantly higher than the current 3-period lead-time demand of ~165) are sufficient to cover forecasted requirements. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this downward regime shift and avoid over-ordering, while keeping L at default as actual lead times have generally adhered to the promised 2 periods (despite occasional anomalies). Sigma_hat will also be calibrated to the recent volatile drop.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough confirmed: Average weekly demand dropped from ~135 (May) to ~55 (June) for P17-P20 (-59%), indicating seasonal low for denim jeggings.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, following a significant demand decline throughout June. Historical data and carry-over insights indicate a mid-summer seasonal trough for this SKU (denim jeggings), with demand dropping from approximately 135 units/week in May to an average of about 55 units/week over the last 5 periods (P17-P21). Period 21 demand was 34 units, consistent with this low-demand regime. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 487 units in-transit. Given the recent demand drop, 487 units in-transit is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next few periods (approx 165 units total for L+1 periods at current rates). Therefore, no new order is required. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (Period 17 onwards, N=5) and increase sigma_hat to account for recent volatility observed during the transition into this trough (P17 sample was 66, P20/P21 were ~30). L remains default (2 periods).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a mid-summer seasonal trough. Weekly demand has dropped significantly from a May average of ~135 units to a June/July average of ~38 units (last three periods: 29, 34, 38). The current date is July 15, 2019. On-hand inventory is 0, but there are 487 units in-transit from a massive order placed previously (likely around Period 18-20, though not explicitly detailed in the order history, the 'In-transit' count confirms it). Given the current demand (avg ~38) and the lead time of 2 periods, the pipeline inventory of 487 is extremely high (covering over 10 periods of demand). To prevent further overstocking and protect against holding costs, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) and keeping L at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (though sparse) matched the 2-period promise. No new orders should be triggered by the OR backend given the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough stabilized at ~38 units/week (Periods 20-22 average: 33.7, +12% growth over 3 periods but remaining very low).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/22 (Period 24). Historical data shows a clear mid-summer demand trough for this SKU (Ladies Denim Jegging), with demand dropping significantly from May (~135 units/week) to June/July (~43 units/week average). Specifically, for the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has been 29, 34, 38, and 52 respectively. While there is a slight upward trend in these last four samples (growth from 29 to 52), the overall regime remains significantly lower than the H1 average. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to capture this current low-demand stable regime (average ~38.25) rather than including the high-demand spring/early summer samples. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility in this trough. Lead time is kept at the default (promised 2) as recent arrivals (though distant in history) generally adhered to 1-2 periods, and there isn't sufficient recent data to suggest otherwise. The current 'In-transit' of 487 units is extremely high relative to current demand (~38/week), which will likely result in a 0-order from the backend, effectively managing the high stock levels until demand recovers later in the year.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand trough stabilized: Average weekly demand for Periods 20-23 is 38.25, showing slight recovery from the Period 20 low (29) but remaining ~70% below May levels.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a mid-summer seasonal trough. For the last five periods (P20-P24), demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 37.6 units per week (29, 34, 38, 52, 35), which is considerably lower than the spring/Easter peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 487 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 2 periods, we are awaiting arrivals to satisfy upcoming demand. To capture the current low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=5, covering the stabilized trough periods. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 2 periods, as recent arrivals (P10) confirmed observed lead times of 1-2 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th (Period 26). Historical demand for these denim jeggings shows a clear seasonal pattern: a spring peak (Easter), followed by a sustained mid-summer low from Period 17 onwards. Recent demand (Periods 20-25) has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 38.5 units/week. While on-hand inventory is currently 0, there are 487 units in-transit. These units likely correspond to the large orders placed in Periods 1-4 that either suffered extreme delays or were lost (specifically the Period 1 order of 161 units was previously flagged as likely lost). However, 487 units in-transit is a massive pipeline relative to the current demand regime (~38 units/week). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 6-period regime (N=6). Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to incorporate observed variability. The goal is to set a target inventory level that prevents further ordering while the excessive pipeline resolves.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand level (Periods 20-25) is consistently low, averaging ~39 units/week, which is ~70% lower than the spring/May baseline. Pipeline inventory (487) significantly exceeds requirements for the current demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. The product (Ladies Denim Jeggings) remains in a mid-summer seasonal trough. For the last 7 periods (P20-P26), demand has been consistently low, averaging 40.28 units/week (range 29-52). On-hand inventory is 0, but in-transit inventory is 487 units. These 487 units were ordered in Period 26 after a long hiatus. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the current low-demand regime (~40 units/week), the pipeline inventory (487) is roughly 12 weeks of supply (487 / 40 \u2248 12.1). This far exceeds the required base stock even at high service levels. The OR backend will automatically cap or zero the order because the pipeline (487) is much greater than the target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mu_hat + safety_stock). I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current stabilized low-demand regime since late June (Period 20). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to use historical averages, though the primary constraint this period is the massive surplus in pipeline inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223033' (denim jeggings) continues in a mid-summer seasonal trough, although recent demand shows a slight upward trend. Demand for the last 5 periods (P23-P27) was: 52, 35, 43, 51, 73 (average: 50.8, up from the ~39 average observed previously). This suggests a possible early emergence from the mid-summer low as we approach the late-August/September BTS (Back-to-School) season, which often boosts denim sales. There are currently 487 units in-transit (ordered on Period 26-27), while on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 2, these units should arrive between Periods 28-29. Given the pipeline (487) far exceeds the current demand regime and the anticipated recovery (forecast ~150-180 for L+1), no additional orders are needed. I will use a recent_N (N=5) to capture the slight uptick in demand while ensuring we don't over-order into a high-stock position.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovering from mid-summer trough: Period 23-27 avg ~51 units/week, up from Period 20-22 avg ~34 (+50%). Pipeline inventory (487) is currently excessive but expected to cover the transition into the Autumn/September season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019 (Period 29). We are entering the late-summer/early-autumn transition. Historical demand patterns show a recovery from the mid-summer low of ~39 units/week (Periods 20-25) towards a higher level (Periods 26-28 average ~68). The Carry-Over Insight from Period 28 highlights this recovery. Currently, we have 487 units in-transit (likely from prior orders that have not yet arrived since Period 10), but 0 on-hand. Given that the pipeline (487) is very large relative to the current demand (even if recovering), we need to set parameters that prevent excessive new ordering while allowing for potential further seasonal growth as we approach September. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend in demand (averaging approx 55 units over last 6 periods), while keeping sigma_hat at default to account for the increasing volatility observed during recovery. L is set to calculate.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Periods 26-28 average demand is 67.7 units, an increase of approx 75% over the Period 20-25 average of ~39 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 30 (2019/9/2). The demand for Jeggings (Ladies Denim) is showing a clear recovery trend as we transition into the Autumn season. Historical demand has increased from a mid-summer trough of ~39 units (Periods 20-25) to a recent average of 84 units over the last three weeks (P27-29: 73, 79, 100). The most recent demand (P29) hit 100 units, indicating the recovery is accelerating. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while 487 units remain in-transit. These in-transit units were likely ordered around Period 4-5 (if they were the backlog or a large re-order) but have not arrived; however, the pipeline inventory logic in the OR backend will treat these as pending arrivals. Given the anticipated seasonal rise for denim in September/October, I am setting mu_hat to capture the recent growth trend using a 3-week window (N=3), while the lead time remains at the promised default of 2. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 3-week volatility to account for the increasing trend. No new order will be triggered because the pipeline (487) far exceeds current needs, but these parameters ensure we monitor the stock-out risk if that shipment is indeed lost.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand increased from a mid-summer low (~39) to a recent 3-week average of 84 units (Periods 27-29), representing a >100% increase.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the early autumn season (September 9th). Historical data from the last few weeks confirms a strong recovery from the mid-summer demand trough. Demand has risen steadily from ~39 units (mid-summer average) to 129 units in the most recent period (Period 30). The 3-period average (P28-P30) is 102.6 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this upward autumn momentum for the mu_hat forecast. Despite the increasing demand, the SKU currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 487 units in-transit (ordered in Period 3). Note that the Period 3 shipment of 140 units and Period 4 shipment of 186 units are severely overdue/lost based on the promised lead time of 2 periods and lack of 'conclude' arrival messages. However, the OR backend's capped policy will account for the large pipeline (487 units). I am keeping L at 'default' (2) as arrivals in Period 4 and 10 showed the lead time is generally stable at 1-2 periods when shipments aren't lost.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand growth sustained: Periods 27-30 show demand increasing from 73 to 129, with a recent 4-week average of 95.25 units, confirming a return to Spring levels.

Period 30 saw a peak of 129 units, confirming that demand is returning to Spring levels (avg ~115-130). However, there is a very large 'In-transit' quantity of 487 units. While 'In-transit' usually indicates orders placed that haven't arrived, the game history shows no orders placed since Period 9 except for the 'In-transit' figure appearing. Given the promised lead time L=2, if these 487 units arrive, they will significantly exceed the current demand requirements (mu_hat for 3 periods \u2248 300-345 units). Because On-hand is currently 0, some inventory is needed, but the backend order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent new orders due to the 487 units in-transit. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the autumn recovery trend accurately. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 5 periods to account for the increased volatility seen during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand recovery finalized: Period 27-31 average demand reached 96.6 units (+147% vs mid-summer trough), returning to Spring baseline levels.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223033 (Denim Jeggings) has fully recovered from its mid-summer trough. Since Period 27 (mid-August), demand has been steadily increasing: 73, 79, 100, 129, 102, 125. The 5-week average is approximately 107 units, which is consistent with the Spring baseline (approx. 100-115 units). Lead times have been stable at 2 periods when observed. There is a massive pipeline inventory of 487 units (from an earlier large order that has not yet arrived). Given the current demand of ~107 units per period and a (L+1) horizon of 3 periods, the required base stock is approximately 321 units plus safety stock. The existing 487 units in-transit are more than sufficient to cover this requirement. However, since the on-hand inventory is currently 0, the goal is to trigger the arrival of these in-transit units or ensure the OR backend maintains a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the autumn recovery and return to the baseline, while relying on the pipeline to satisfy demand once it arrives.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223033 (Jeggings) is experiencing a significant autumn surge. Period 33 demand spiked to 266, which is consistent with the late-September peak observed in similar retail cycles. This is a substantial jump from the previous 4-week average of ~114 (Periods 29-32). Given the in-transit inventory of 487 units, which was placed during earlier periods and has yet to arrive, the primary concern is the potential loss of that shipment, rather than over-ordering. If those 487 units arrive, they will adequately cover the recent demand spike and provide a cushion for the next 2-3 periods. However, the pipeline is extremely high relative to history, so I will maintain 'default' lead time (2 periods) and use a 'recent_N' of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the autumn recovery trend (P29-P33 avg: 144.4) without over-reacting to the single P33 spike, ensuring the OR engine's stock-up policy accounts for the heavy pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained autumn demand growth: 5-week average (P29-P33) is 144.4 units, representing a full recovery to and exceeding Spring levels. Significant demand spike observed at P33 (266 units), potentially signaling a secondary seasonal peak in late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits strong seasonality, with a significant autumn recovery transitioning into October. Current demand is high, with a recent 5-week average (P30-P34) of 153 units, inclusive of a significant spike to 266 in P33. The 'Period 34 convene' shows an order of 144 was placed, which is expected to arrive in Period 36 (given the promised lead time of 2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 631 (which includes the 144 ordered in P34 plus 487 prior units which have been in-transit for multiple months). There is a high risk that the older 487 units are lost, as they have not arrived in over 7 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P29-P34) to capture the autumn growth and the P33 spike, resulting in an average of approx 145 units per week. For L, I will use 'default' (2) as recent successful deliveries (P10) matched this, but stays cautious. sigma_hat will use the last 6 periods to account for the high volatility seen in P33.

Carry-over insight: Older pipeline inventory (487 units) is likely lost as it has not arrived for over 10 periods; the system should rely on new orders. Autumn demand peak confirmed: 5-week average (P30-P34) is 153 units, with a baseline near 130-140 and high volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). The product is denim jeggings, currently in an autumn demand recovery phase. Recent demand (P30-P35) has averaged approximately 148 units (129, 102, 125, 266, 143, 125), significantly higher than the mid-summer low (~39). There was a major peak in P33 (266), which causes high volatility, but the underlying baseline for October seems to be around 125-145 units. Inventory is a major concern: On-hand is 0, and the backlog of demand is high. While in-transit is 631 units, 487 of those are likely lost (as noted in Period 35 carry-over), leaving only the 144 units ordered in Period 34 as a viable upcoming shipment. These 144 units are expected to arrive in Period 36 conclude (visible next period). Given the lead time of 2, we need to order for Period 39 coverage. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6), capturing the autumn recovery regime while smoothing the P33 spike, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the increased volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in a post-autumn peak phase where demand has softened from the late September high (266 units) to a more moderate level (last 3 periods: 143, 125, 81). The in-transit inventory of 631 units likely includes the recent order of 144 from Period 34 and a large stale stock of 487 units (P18-P26 period) previously flagged as lost. Since promised lead time is 2, the order from Period 34 (ordered Oct 7) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of the current Period 37, which we will only see in the Period 37 'conclude' message (Period 38 START). I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use a recent 4-period window (N=4, Periods 33-36) which captures the recent high-demand regime (avg = 153.75) to ensure we maintain enough stock for a potential secondary peak or holiday buildup. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly higher volatility observed since Period 33.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak stabilization: Demand decreased from 266 (P33) to 81 (P36), but remains above summer lows. Current 4-week average (P33-P36) is 153.75.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 37 spiked unexpectedly to 233 units, following a quieter period. The 5-week average (P33-P37) is approximately 170 units, but if we look at the post-autumn peak stabilization, the demand is volatile. The lead time remains at the promised 2 periods, but there's a significant history of lost/missing shipments (P1, P3, P34). Specifically, the order from P34 (144 units) is now overdue (it should have arrived by P36 conclude, read at P37). I will assume any in-transit inventory older than 3 periods is lost. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 687 units, which includes the 487 units flagged as lost since Period 35, the 144 units from Period 34 (likely lost), and symbols from Period 37. To ensure the backend places an order despite this ghost pipeline, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current high-volatility autumn regime (avg ~170) and setting L to 'calculate' to use the historical average for lead time. However, to account for the likely lost 144 units from P34 and the ghost 487 units, I need to ensure mu_hat is sufficiently high or use an explicit value to force the inventory position high enough to trigger an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Secondary autumn demand spike observed at Period 37 (233 units), similar to the P33 peak. Order from Period 34 (144 units) is likely lost as it is overdue by 1 period and follows the pattern of the missing 487-unit shipment.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November 2019), we are in a high-demand autumn/pre-holiday phase for denim jeggings. Recent demand (P37: 233, P38: 234) shows a significant sustained surge compared to early October levels (~100-120). The pipeline is problematic: out of the 673 units in-transit, 487 (from early periods) and 144 (ordered P34, now 5 periods overdue) are almost certainly lost based on historical patterns and the fact that the P37 order arrived in just 1 period. Only the P38 order (42 units) is reliably in-transit. With 0 on-hand inventory and the recent demand spikes (~234 units), we are severely undersupplied. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new elevated demand regime (~143-234 range), effectively signaling the OR backend to place a significant order to cover the (L+1) period demand and recover service levels before the winter season.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 37: Weekly demand has surged to ~234 units (+70% from P34-36 levels of ~138), signaling a pre-holiday peak for ladies' denim. Consistent with previous patterns, orders not arriving within 3 periods (specifically the 144 units from P34) are considered lost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019/11/11), demand remains high but volatile. The most recent demand (P39: 145) is lower than the P37-P38 peaks (~234) but well above the autumn baseline. I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime associated with the pre-holiday season for Ladies Denim. In-transit inventory is listed as 726 units; however, historical analysis suggests that most of this is comprised of long-lost shipments (specifically the 487 units from early periods and the 144 units from P34). Only the orders from P38 (42 units) and P39 (53 units) are currently viable in the pipeline. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P38) show lead times of 1-2 periods are still occurring despite the losses. The OR engine will use the high mu_hat and sigma_hat to calculate a base stock that triggers significant replacement orders to account for the massive demand/inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand has moderated from the late-October peak (234) to 145, but remains in a high-volatility holiday regime. Effective pipeline inventory is only 95 units (P38-P39 orders); all other in-transit units (631) are confirmed lost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-18. We are in the mid-November period which typically leads into the Black Friday and holiday shopping peaks for retail apparel (Ladies Denim). Demand has moderated slightly from the late-October peak (234) to 127 in P40, but volatility remains high. In-transit inventory stands at 758, but based on past patterns, older shipments (P3 plus any others from months ago totaling 631 units) and the P34 shipment (144 units) are confirmed lost. Only the orders from P38 (42 units), P39 (53 units), and P40 (32 units) are considered live (effective pipeline = 127). Since current on-hand is 0 and recent demand (last 4 periods: 233, 234, 145, 127) averages 184.75, we need to maintain a higher base stock to prepare for the December holiday surge. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher-demand holiday regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains volatile (observed 1 and 2 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed (P37-P40): Average demand has stabilized at ~185 units, with continued high volatility. Effective pipeline inventory remains low as only P38-P40 orders are considered active; all units ordered prior to P38 (totaling 733 units) are lost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late November (Cyber Monday) and December holiday season. Historical analysis shows a high-volatility holiday regime (P37-P41) with an average demand of approximately 168 units. Although the most recent demand was 103, this follows a significant peak (233 and 234 units) and should be viewed as a temporary dip before the December holiday surge. Pipeline inventory management remains critical: out of the 705 units in-transit, 631 units (orders from P20 and P34) are confirmed lost after failing to arrive for 7+ periods. The actual effective pipeline consists only of orders from Period 38 (42 units), Period 40 (32 units), and the current potential order. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and only 74 effective units are in-transit, we must order aggressively. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the holiday shift since P37) to capture the current high-demand regime, and keeping L as default (2) as recent arrivals (P37, P39) suggest delivery is occurring within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (starting P37) average demand identified at ~168 units per period despite weekly volatility. Effective pipeline inventory remains severely reduced as 631 units (ordered P20, P34) are confirmed lost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 42 surged to 371 units, the highest recorded in the history, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Date 2019/11/25 coincides with the week of Black Friday). This represents a significant seasonal spike. The current holiday demand regime (P37-P42) now averages ~198 units/period. The pipeline inventory of 705 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments (487 from P20, 144 from P34, 42 from P38, 32 from P40); only recent demand suggests we are out of stock and missing large portions of the pipeline. To ensure the backend orders sufficiently to meet the current high-demand holiday phase and recover from the stockout, I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent holiday average (~200) plus a buffer for the seasonal peak, and an explicit lead time of 2. Sigma_hat is set high to account for the volatility seen in the 371-unit spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 371 units (Black Friday), increasing the holiday regime (P37-P42) average to ~198 units (+18% from previous estimate). Pipeline integrity is still poor; orders from P38 (42 units) and P40 (32 units) are now overdue and tentatively considered lost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are deep in the holiday season. Recent demand has been highly volatile: P42 saw a massive spike of 371 (Black Friday), while P43 dropped to 84 (post-peak trough). The average demand over the holiday regime (P37-P43) is approximately 181 units/period. The pipeline is critical: only the order from P43 (202 units) is currently reliable. Orders from P38 (42 units) are significantly overdue (6 periods since order) and must be considered lost along with the previous bulk of 733 units from early periods. The P40 order finally arrived in P43 with a 3-period lead time. To ensure we capture the remaining December demand and potentially higher levels closer to Christmas, I will set mu_hat based on the recent holiday regime average and elevate sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed (84 to 371). Setting L=3 reflects the actual arrival experiences from P40 and P43.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday lead time confirmed at 3 periods (P40 order arrived P43). Holiday demand volatility is extreme (range 84-371), with a regime average of ~181 units since P37. Systematic loss of shipments not arriving within 3-4 periods is confirmed.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 is mid-December (2019/12/16), following the Black Friday peak (P42, 371 units) and leading into the Christmas/New Year period. Demand has moderated significantly from the peak, with P43 and P44 showing 84 and 108 units respectively. Based on historical trends, we are in a high-volatility holiday regime. I estimate the regime demand mean since the start of the holiday surge (P37) to be approximately 175 units (avg [233, 234, 145, 127, 103, 371, 84, 108]). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will explicitly set L=3 to account for potential holiday logistics delays and ensure safety stock. The pipeline is currently heavily inflated by lost orders (733 units from before P38 are confirmed lost). The effective pipeline consists only of P43 (202 units) and P44 (199 units), totaling 401 units. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat at (1+3)*175 = 700 to ensure we target enough stock for the final periods of the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P37-P44) average demand is approximately 175 units per period with very high volatility (std ~100). Effective pipeline includes only orders from P43 onwards; all 733 units ordered prior to P43 (excluding the arrived P40 order) are considered lost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the Christmas and holiday shopping season. Historical demand for this period (P45) was 205, reflecting high holiday volume. Recent holiday regime (P37-P45) average demand is 176.7 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~90). The lead time has been unstable: P40 took 3 periods, while P43 arrived in 2 periods; I am using L=2 (promised) but monitoring for delays. Pipeline integrity remains a major issue\u2014of the 872 units reported in-transit, 487 (ordered P20) and 144 (ordered P34) are confirmed lost based on previous carry-over insights. A newer order from P38 (42 units) is also highly suspect as it is now 8 periods old. The only reliable 'live' pipeline is the P44 order (199 units). With 0 on-hand and 199 reliable in-transit units, we are under-stocked relative to a (L+1=3) period window for the holiday regime (3 * 176.7 = 530 units). I am setting mu_hat to 175 and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture this holiday volatility specifically, ensuring the OR backend targets a high base stock to capture remaining December demand.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P37-P45) average demand is 176.7 units with high volatility (std ~90). Verified reliable pipeline consists only of orders from P44 (199 units); all 631 units ordered prior to P38 are confirmed lost, and P38 order (42 units) is likely lost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, marking the end of the holiday peak season. Demand in Period 46 was 142 units, slightly lower than the holiday regime average (P37-P46) of ~173 units, but significantly higher than summer levels. Recent history shows high volatility (e.g., Black Friday spike of 371 in P42 followed by 84 in P43). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting an 'explicit' L=3 is safest to account for holiday shipping delays and to avoid stockouts. A demand regime shift is anticipated as we move into January, usually a slower retail period compared to December. However, to maintain service levels during the transition, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated holiday baseline and volatility. Regarding the pipeline: In-transit inventory is 872, but history confirms that 631 units (orders prior to P38) and the P38 (42 units) order are lost. The active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (199 units). With On-hand = 0, the backend must ensure the next order covers the gap between this active pipeline and the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition (Jan 2020): Monitoring for expected demand decrease following the Dec peak. Confirmed lost shipments: 733 units ordered prior to P43 (excluding the P40 arrival) are considered permanently lost and should be excluded from effective pipeline calculations.
