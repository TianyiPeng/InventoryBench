Calendar: Current date is Feb 11, 2019. We are just before Valentine's Day (Feb 14), which might see a slight bump in nightwear sales, though the data provided shows relatively stable demand (Avg ~60 units/week). Demand History: Recent weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show demand levels of 47, 63, 69, 60, and 61 (Mean ~60, SD ~8). Inventory Position: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover the next 3 periods (Period 1, 2, and 3), I need to account for demand until the Period 1 order arrives in Period 3's arrival phase (making it available for Period 4). At an average of 60 units/period, base demand for 3 periods is 180. Adding a small safety stock buffer due to 0 current stock, I will order 200 units to establish a pipeline.",

Inventory management is currently strained due to shipment reliability and lead time volatility. Specifically, Period 1 order (200 units) is lost, and the Period 10 order (50 units) is now five periods overdue, which strongly suggests it is also lost. Removing both from the 'In-transit' count (330 - 200 - 50) yields a reliable pipeline of 80 units (from P13 order = 0?, wait, P13 was 0, P14 was 50, P15 is now). Re-checking pipeline: In-transit 330 contains: P1(200), P10(50), P11(0), P12(0), P13(0), P14(50), P15(current). Actually, 'In-transit' 330 units must include the 200 (P1), plus P10(50), P11(0? no, P11 was 50, P12 was 45, P13 was 0, P14 was 50). Let's trace arrivals: P11 arrived on P13 conclude. P12 arrived on P14 conclude. Therefore, the current 330 in-transit consists of: P1 (200 - lost), P10 (50 - lost), and P14 (50) and a previous order likely from my P14 decision. With On-hand = 0, I must cover demand for P15, P16, and P17 (L+1 periods). Estimated demand is ~50-60/week. I need ~180 units.

Historical trends show demand remained high (avg ~70) through October, but dropped to 35 in P39 before returning to 60 in P40. As we approach late November and December, demand for nightwear typically increases due to colder weather and holiday gifting. Inventory assessment: On-hand is 73. Pipeline reconciling: Total in-transit is 800. Based on carry-over insights, 580 units are confirmed lost (P1, 10, 14, 17, 24, 26, 29, 34). Effective in-transit = 800 - 580 = 220 units. These effective units are from P38 (60), P39 (70), and P40 (60), plus some safety stock. Lead time is variable (1-3 periods). To cover demand for the next 3 weeks (expected ~70/week) plus safety stock for the holiday surge, I need a target inventory position of ~280-300 units. Current position (On-hand 73 + Effective In-transit 220) = 293 units. Since current position is adequate for current demand levels and I want to avoid high holding costs if the late-year surge is delayed, I will place a conservative order to maintain the pipeline.",

Specifically, the P42 order (60) should arrive in P44/P45, and the P43 order (180) in P45/P46. To maximize reward for the final 3 periods (P45, P46, P47) with an estimated demand of ~150-200 units per week, we need to ensure enough stock is available for the very end.
