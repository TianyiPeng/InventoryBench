Since L=2, these units are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). No arrivals were expected in Period 1.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent historical demand (P1: 155; Prior: 140, 131, 122, 108, 96) shows a strong upward trend, likely due to spring seasonality for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' denim. The average of the last 6 points is ~125, but the most recent point (155) suggests the OR's mean estimate might be lagging.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0, in-transit is 149 (from P1). Total pipeline is 149. We already stocked out in Period 1 (demand 155, sold 0) because we started with 0 inventory.\n4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 161 units. Using the formula: Base Stock = (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, we need to cover demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4. If demand is ~150/period, we need ~450 total. Currently, we have 149 in transit.\n5. **Adjustment**: The OR recommendation of 161 is based on the capped policy.

This aligns with the 'lead time = 2' definition (N+L = 1+2=3).\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was ~120 units. However, recent demand has spiked significantly: P1 (155) and P2 (193). The product is 'Luna skinny RW' (women's jeans), and we are moving into the spring fashion season in late February, which explains the upward trend.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 310 units (149 from P1 + 161 from P2). P1 order should satisfy some backlogged demand/stockouts in P3 resolution, but we are currently losing sales because we started with 0 inventory.\n\n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 187 units. OR calculates based on historical mean which is likely lower than the recent surge (155, 193). The 'cap' logic in OR might be throttling the response to this surge.

Strategy: I am currently experiencing a 100% stockout rate because no inventory has arrived yet. The OR recommendation of 47 is very low because it sees a large pipeline (497) relative to its calculated base stock. However, given the increasing demand trend and the fact that the first order (P1) is already delayed, I need to ensure that once arrivals start, I can cover the current demand regime (~200/week).

Total lost pipeline is estimated at 486 units. The 'In-transit' of 736 units consists of these 486 'dead' units and the P8 order of 250 units. While P5 and P7 arrived in 1 period, the average reliable lead time remains closer to 2 units when they aren't lost.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P4-P8) has averaged 264 units per period (257, 312, 236, 211, 305). The OR baseline (0 units) is heavily influenced by the inflated 'In-transit' figure and the very low initial historical mean (140). \n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 195 units. The only reliable coming arrival is the P8 order (250 units). Expecting P8 to deliver by P10, the total reliable supply for P9 and P10 is 195 (on-hand) + 250 (P8) = 445 units. \n4. **Requirement**: Given a demand regime around 265 units/period, we need roughly 530 units to cover the next two periods (P9 and P10).

Inventory Position: On-hand (316) plus expected P10 arrival (250) equals 566 units available for Period 11 demand. Period 12 demand will need further coverage. \n4.

In-transit shows 986 units, but 486 units are 'ghost inventory' (lost). Remaining 'real' pipeline: P10 (250), P11 (250). Since P9 order arrived in P10 (L=1), it is highly likely the P10 order arrived in P11 or P12, but the history shows 'arrived=0' for P11 and P12 conclude. This suggests P10 and P11 orders (500 units total) are the only viable arrivals for Period 13 and 14. 4. Strategy: To cover P13 and P14 demand at ~200 units/period, we need 400 available units.

Lead Time & Pipeline: The Period 23 order (100 units) and Period 24 order (180 units) are currently in-transit, with the P23 order expected to arrive this period (P25) based on the observed L=1 or L=2 pattern.

The OR recommendation of 0 units is misleading because it calculates base-stock based on a total 'In-transit' figure of 1,961 units. However, my historical tracking confirms that 1,746 of those units are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P18, P24). The true pipeline inventory is only 215 units (representing the remainder of the P26/P29 orders or similar discrepancies, as P30 and P31 already arrived). On-hand inventory is 146. Total effective inventory (On-hand + True In-transit) is approx 361 units. With a demand mean of ~335 and a lead time fluctuating between 1-2 periods, I need to cover at least 2-3 periods of demand (~670-1000 units total).

This indicates a significant spike, potentially due to seasonal peak demand for superstretch denim jeans in late September. My current inventory position is critical: on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' total is 2,511 units, but as established in previous carry-over insights, 1,746 of these units are confirmed lost/ghost inventory from Periods 1-24. Thus, true in-transit inventory is 765 units (consisting of orders from Period 29, 32, and 33). Specifically, the P29 order (150 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, while the P32 (350 units) and P33 (550 units) orders are the only ones likely to arrive. Given the lead time is varying between 1-2 periods, the P32 order might arrive this period (P34) and the P33 order in P34 or P35. To cover the next 2-3 periods of this high-demand surge (estimated at ~500-700 per period), the current 'live' pipeline of 900 units (P32+P33) is insufficient. The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored as it likely factors in the 'ghost' inventory from the in-transit total.

Historical demand for the last three periods has been 293, 310, and 482, indicating a high-demand regime (superstretch denim autumn high season) with the most recent week showing a significant spike. Lead-time Inference: The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 2,261 units. Using the cumulative ghost inventory assessment (1,896 units as of P37), the active pipeline consists of orders from P34 (650 units). Based on the P34 order's timing, it has been in transit for 5 periods and is now significantly overdue compared to the promised lead time of 2 (or observed 1-3). Given the frequent loss of older shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P18, P24, P29), there is a high probability that the P34 order is also lost or indefinitely delayed. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees a massive pipeline of 2,261 units and does not account for ghost inventory. Subtracting the ghost inventory (1,896) and the likely lost P34 order (650) results in a negative effective inventory position.

The total 'In-transit' value of 3311 units is heavily inflated by at least 2,546 units from orders confirmed lost or severely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P18, P24, P29, and P34). Subtracting this ghost inventory reveals a true pipeline of approximately 765 units. Current demand for these superstretch denim jeans in the autumn/winter season (P36-P40) is averaging ~331 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 0, we must cover at least 3 periods of demand (current period + 2-period lead time) to avoid stockouts. Our true inventory position (0 on-hand + 765 valid in-transit) is barely sufficient to cover the next ~2.3 periods of demand. Given that recent lead times have drifted toward 3 periods, we face a significant stockout risk. I will order 450 units to bolster the pipeline for the late-November demand and account for the high probability of further shipment losses, while maintaining a slight buffer against holding costs as we approach the end of the 47-period horizon.",

However, consistent tracking and history indicate that a large portion of this inventory (estimated at 2,546 units from periods 1-34) is actually 'ghost inventory' from lost or severely delayed shipments. The true pipeline inventory consists of the orders from Period 40 (450 units) and Period 41 (450 units), totaling 900 units. Adding current on-hand (319) gives a total reliable inventory position of 1,219 units. Current demand has stabilized in an 'autumn regime' of approximately 285 units per period. With a 2-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 42, 43, and 44. Total requirement = ~285 * 3 = 855 units. Since our reliable inventory (1,219) is sufficient to cover this, and the game is approaching its end (Period 42 of 47), I will follow the OR suggestion of 0 to avoid over-ordering and incurring liquidating/holding costs at the game's conclusion, especially since the inventory position is healthy against the current demand trend.",

Demand Analysis: Demand spiked to 999 units in P42 (Black Friday week), following a regime of ~280 units. The upcoming periods (December) are expected to remain high due to holiday shopping for 'superstretch denim'. The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely views the inflated 'In-transit' figure (3,161) as sufficient coverage. Strategy: I must override the OR recommendation. Given the P42 spike and expected holiday demand, I need to ensure enough inventory is arriving. Current functional pipeline (discounting lost orders) is 900 units. If demand stays near 300-400 (excluding the 999 spike), 900 units covers about 2.5 periods.

After subtracting these lost units (2661 - 2546), the functional pipeline consists only of the 115 units remaining from recent orders (specifically the Period 43 order of 400). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods (999 and 922), coinciding with the early December holiday shopping season. Given the item is 'superstretch skinny jeans', this spike is likely a sustained seasonal peak. With an actual lead time fluctuating between 2-3 periods, I must order enough to cover approximately 3-4 periods of high demand to avoid further stockouts.
