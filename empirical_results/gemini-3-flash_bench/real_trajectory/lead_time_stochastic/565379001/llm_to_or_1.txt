Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Moa tank', a basic women's vest top. Historical data for the last 5 weeks shows a stable demand mean of approximately 299 units (269, 299, 301, 333, 292). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first decision period, there are no existing shipments to reconcile. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent stable demand regime before any potential spring seasonal shifts. The OR engine will use these to set a base stock that covers demand over the lead time (2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The item is 'Moa tank', a classic jersey basic. In Period 1, an order of 337 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2. We observed a demand of 273 in Period 1, which resulted in lost sales as we started with 0 inventory. The historical demand samples (269, 299, 301, 333, 292) and the Period 1 demand (273) show a relatively stable mean around 295. Since we have no recorded arrivals yet, we adhere to the promised lead time (L=2). The goal is to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to recover from the stockout. Using all 6 available data points (5 historical + Period 1) for the forecast.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tank top. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged ~300. However, Period 2 saw a significant spike to 506. While this could be a random fluctuation, it might signal an early spring shift for 'Everyday Basics'. Total demand over the first two periods was 779 units, but zero units were sold because the initial on-hand was 0 and orders have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (337 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 3 (viewable in Period 4). The order from Period 2 (333 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 4. Total in-transit is 670 units. Since on-hand is currently 0 and we have missed substantial sales (lost demand), I will set mu_hat using the recent 5 samples (P-3 to P2) to account for the recent spike while smoothing volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (5) to capture the increased variance from the P2 jump. L remains default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a basic women's vest top. Historical data show a demand spike in P2 (506 units), which might be a pre-spring uplift, though P1 and P3 are closer to the earlier samples (approx 270-330). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1,167 units in transit. No arrivals have been confirmed yet. Promised lead time is 2. The order from P1 (337 units) should arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4, but the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests a delay or that the lead time is at least 3 periods. I will adjust L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for this observed delay and ensure the OR backend's base stock covers a longer pipeline. I will use recent_N for demand (N=8, covering the 5 pre-game and 3 game samples) to capture the recent mean shift (average ~320) while accounting for the P2 spike.

Carry-over insight: Potential lead time extension: P1 order (placed 2019-02-11) did not arrive by P3 conclude, indicating actual lead time >= 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are managing a women's fitted vest top. Historical demand samples (269, 299, 301, 333, 292) and observed demands (P1:273, P2:506, P3:329, P4:298) suggest a mean weekly demand around 322 units, though P2 showed a significant spike. Regarding lead time: the order from P2 arrived in P4 (lead_time=2), but the order from P1 (placed 2019/2/11) is still missing. If it were lead_time=2, it should have arrived in P3; if lead_time=3, it should have arrived in P4. Since it did not, and P2's order arrived first, P1's shipment is likely lost. Promised lead time is 2, and the P2 arrival confirms the system can still deliver in 2 periods. However, a lost shipment significantly depletes pipeline stock. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand (including the spike) and keep L at the default promised 2 while observing if P1 ever arrives.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (337 units) is confirmed lost/overdue; did not arrive by P4 conclude while P2 order arrived ahead of it.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' fitted vest top, moving into mid-March. Demand has stabilized after a spike in Period 2 (which may have been a one-time event or early spring transition), with recent demand averaging around 286 units (Periods 4-5). Shipment P1 (337 units) is confirmed lost/overdue as P2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time 2), but P1 remains missing despite having the same promised lead time of 2. P3 (497 units) was expected in Period 5 but didn't arrive, suggesting a possible lead time extension or localized delay. Current on-hand is 0, with 1255 in-transit (P3, P4, P5). To recover from the lost shipment P1 and current stockout, I'll set L to 3 to account for the observed delay in P3 and set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the stabilized demand level (~300 units/week), resulting in mu_hat \u2248 (1+3)*300 = 1200. This ensures the OR backend targets a higher pipeline inventory to compensate for the stockout and the lost Period 1 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed stockout status due to Period 5 arrival failure (P3 order); Actual lead time for P3 is >= 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant lead time instability and lost shipments: Period 1's order is still missing (overdue by 4+ periods), Period 3's order (497 units) is overdue (promised 2, now 4 periods), while Period 5's order arrived early (lead time 1). This indicates high volatility in the supply chain. Demand is relatively stable, averaging 298 units/period over the last 5 weeks (excluding Period 2's outlier of 506). Given the supply uncertainty and current stockout, I will set an explicit lead time of 3 periods to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high risk of delay and the inventory pipeline. I will use the mean demand from the last 5 periods (excluding the outlier) for mu_hat: (~300 * 4) = 1200. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: P1 order (337) and P3 order (497) are significantly overdue or lost, while P5 order arrived in 1 period; Pipeline inventory may be unreliable.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (Moa tank) is currently facing severe stockouts and supply chain instability. Period 7 Conclude shows 0 arrived units despite an in-transit pipeline, and the starting on-hand for Period 8 is 0. Analysis of lead times: P2 arrived in 2 periods (promised), P5 arrived in 1 period (ahead), but P1 (ordered P1) and P3 (ordered P3) are significantly overdue or lost (6 and 4 periods lapsed respectively). The OR backend includes 'in-transit' in its base-stock calculation, but since P1 (337) and P3 (497) are likely lost, I must assume a higher demand requirement to force new orders. Demand remains stable around 300 units/week. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (approx 300 avg). I am setting L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for the observed delays and ensure the base stock calculation covers a total of 4 periods (L+1), which helps compensate for the missing units in the physical pipeline even if they still appear in the 'in-transit' data.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Supply chain instability persists; P1 and P3 orders are confirmed as lost or severely delayed (total 834 units). Order logic must now overcompensate to restore on-hand availability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5548.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis shows significant supply chain disruption: orders from Period 1 (337 units) and Period 3 (497 units) are now 8 and 6 periods old respectively, and because they have not arrived despite subsequent orders (P5, P6, P7) arriving, they are confirmed lost. These 834 lost units are inflating the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend, causing it to under-order. To correct this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed volatility and setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To find the correct mu_hat, I calculate the target base stock. Average demand over the last 5 periods (excluding stockout-constrained sales) is approximately 306 units. For a lead time of 2-3 periods, a safe base stock is around (L+1) * 306 plus a safety buffer (~1200 units total). Since the backend subtracts in-transit (1220), a 'normal' calculation results in zero orders. I set mu_hat explicitly to 2100 to force an order that compensates for the 834 phantom units in-transit, ensuring we replenish physical stock for upcoming spring demand (April).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory is officially decoupled from reality: 834 units from P1 and P3 are lost. Parameter overrides (explicit mu_hat) are required until physical stock is restored to prevent perpetual stockouts caused by phantom in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's tank top. Historical demand averages roughly 318 units/week (last 10 samples: 269, 299, 301, 333, 292, 273, 506, 329, 298, 275). While there was a spike in late Feb, recent demand has stabilized around 280-320.

The critical issue is the 'Phantom Pipeline Inventory.' Orders from P1 (337) and P3 (497) are officially lost/overdue (total 834 units). The OR backend sees 1788 units in transit and will likely order 0 because it believes the pipeline is full. However, 834 of those units are likely never coming. Current on-hand is 0. 

To force an order despite the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' high value. The base stock formula is (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat). Pipeline is ~1788. To get a fresh order of ~300-400 units, base stock needs to be ~2100. Given average demand is 318 and L=2, a normal mu_hat would be ~954. By explicitly setting mu_hat to 2200, I bypass the OR engine's hesitation caused by the lost shipments and ensure we receive stock to cover upcoming spring demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the sku 565379001 (Women's Jersey Vest) has an on-hand inventory of 334 units and a massive pipeline of 1852 units. However, previous insights confirm that orders from Period 1 (337 units) and Period 3 (497 units), totaling 834 units, are lost. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see the 'In-transit' figure 1852 and likely stop ordering, even though 834 of those units will never arrive. To prevent another stockout once current on-hand is depleted, I am using an explicit mu_hat strategy. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 296 units over the last 5 periods (excluding the outlier jump in P2). I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~300 units per period. With a lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods (1+2), requiring 900 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 1800. This compensates for the 834 lost units appearing in the 'In-transit' total, ensuring the backend calculates a 'base_stock' high enough to trigger a fresh order to cover upcoming demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Vest) is transitioning into a spring/summer demand regime. Analysis of the shipment history confirms that 834 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are permanently lost, as they are over 8 periods overdue while subsequent orders (P5, P6, P7, P9) have all arrived. These 'phantom' units are still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculations (In-transit: 1852), which would cause the system to under-order or produce zero-unit orders despite the need to replenish physical stock. The on-hand inventory is currently low (104) following two periods of moderate demand (~230 units/week). To bypass the pipeline inflation, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to force a base stock that prioritizes physical replenishment. Using the last 5 demand samples (avg ~260) and a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) is 780. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the base stock calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) ends up high enough after subtracting the 1852 phantom units to trigger a meaningful order. Lead time 'calculate' is used to reflect the erratic but generally short actual arrivals (range 1-2).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 834 lost units (P1, P3) that will never arrive; explicit mu_hat overrides are necessary to force ordering until physical stock levels stabilize.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6) shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and a current stockout. The pipeline inventory (1852 units) is heavily distorted by 834 lost units from Periods 1 and 3 (337 + 497). These 'phantom' units prevent the OR engine from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. Physical inventory is zero, and recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 222 units. To force an order and bypass the 834-unit phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the lead time (L+1=3 periods) PLUS the lost 834 units. Base demand for 3 periods (~670) + 834 units = ~1500. This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation (1500 - 1852) doesn't suppress ordering while still accounting for the valid P10 order of 632 units (which should arrive shortly). This aggressive calibration is required to restore physical stock and provide a buffer for the upcoming summer season for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' tank top.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (May 13). The SKU is a 'Moa tank' (Womens Everyday Basics), which typically sees stable or slightly increasing demand moving into summer. Recent demand has cooled (approx 140-230 units) compared to the February-March peak. However, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced a total stockout for the last period. The critical issue remains the 834 phantom units in 'In-transit' from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost/overdue. The OR backend subtracts the full 1852 in-transit units from the base stock calculation; since 834 of those will never arrive, the backend significantly under-orders or fails to order at all (as seen in Periods 11-13 where ordered=0 despite falling stock). To force the system to bypass this blocked pipeline and place an order to restore physical stock, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~200 units/period. For a target (L+1) horizon (3 periods), base stock should be roughly 600-700. To offset the 834 phantom units and actually trigger an order, I am setting mu_hat to 1600. For sigma, I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows that 834 units from Period 1 and Period 3 orders are lost, but they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (1852 units total). Because the backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', those phantom 834 units prevent the system from placing new orders unless the mu_hat parameter is artificially inflated. Recent demand has stabilized at a lower level (~180/week) following a higher period. To force the OR backend to place an order and restore physical stock, I must set an explicit mu_hat that exceeds the phantom pipeline. Total in-transit (1852) - lost units (834) = 1018 units actually expected. However, with 0 on-hand and recent missed demand, I will set mu_hat to 2600 to overcome the full 1852 in-transit count plus desired safety stock (approx. 3-4 weeks/750 units). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (ranging from 1 to 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockout persists as of Period 15 despite 1852 units in pipeline; 834 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3), requiring mu_hat > 1852 to trigger any replenishment.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (Moa tank) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory of 2710 units is heavily distorted by 834 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost. The backend logic calculates base_stock - pipeline_inventory; if pipeline_inventory is inflated by phantom units, the system will not order. To force a replenishment order in Period 16, I must set mu_hat (target stock) higher than the functional pipeline inventory. Current mean demand is roughly 250 units/week. With a promised lead time of 2, the lookahead is 3 periods (750 units). However, to offset the 834 lost units and handle the current deficit, I set mu_hat explicitly to 3500. This ensures the backend sees (3500 - 2710) = 790 units as the required order magnitude, which aligns with approximately 3 weeks of safety stock and immediate demand coverage once received. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed variability (1-2 periods).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a critical stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a history of unreliable supply chains and phantom pipeline inventory. To date, 834 units (ordered in Periods 1 and 3) are confirmed lost, but they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' figure of 3722 units. This creates a risk where the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' logic results in zero orders because it believes the supply is sufficient. In Period 15 and 16, massive orders (858 and 1012 units) were placed, but they have not arrived yet. Since the current date (June 3) is post-winter/spring, demand for this 'Fitted vest top' (Womens Everyday Basics) is likely staying steady or increasing slightly. The average demand across all periods (including provided seeds) is approximately 264 units/week. To force the OR engine to order despite the 3722 units in pipeline (of which 834 are definitely lost and the rest are still within or slightly outside the 2-period lead time), I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the pipeline plus desired safety stock. I will target a massive safety hedge to ensure arrivals keep coming until the stockout ends, setting mu_hat = 4500 (representing approx 17 weeks of demand) to overcome the pipeline noise and ensure continuous ordering.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 834 lost units (P1, P3) that will never arrive; explicit mu_hat > current in-transit is necessary to force replenishment orders until physical stock stabilizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $610.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, two large orders (ordered in P15 and P16) arrived simultaneously, totaling 1870 units. This has finally resolved the systemic stockout that plagued the mid-periods of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 1746 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the immediate demand (recent average is ~150-200 units per week). The 'In-transit' figure of 2863 still includes the 834 lost units from P1 and P3, but with physical stock now available, we no longer need the extreme mu_hat overrides to force orders. The supply chain has shown lead times of 1-2 periods recently. I will now normalize parameters back toward the observed demand mean while accounting for the 'phantom' pipeline. Since in-transit (2863) includes 834 lost units, the OR backend sees 'active' pipeline as 2029 plus any new orders. To avoid over-ordering given the massive on-hand surplus, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower demand seen since May, and use the default lead time. This will likely result in zero orders for a few periods until the inventory is digested.

Carry-over insight: Physical stock restored in Period 17; normalizing demand parameters following period of systemic stockout. 834 units from P1/P3 remain lost in pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 19 (2019/6/17). The product is a 'Womens Fitted vest top', which typically sees peak demand in late spring and early summer; however, observed demand has decreased from ~230 (Period 11) to 92 (Period 18). Physical on-hand inventory is now healthy at 1654 units. Pipeline inventory (2863) includes 834 units from Periods 1 and 3 that are confirmed lost/overdue. This 'phantom' inventory would normally prevent the OR backend from ordering. However, with 1654 on hand and demand trending below 150 units/period, the current stock covers over 10 periods of demand. No replenishment is needed this period. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (capturing the softening demand trend) and 'calculate' for lead time. The OR engine will subtract the pipeline (2863) from the base stock (approx 450-500) and correctly result in no order.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '565379001' (Womens Everyday Basics Fitted Vest) is currently in a high-inventory state following a massive replenishment in Period 17 which corrected for long-standing stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 1532 units, and the pipeline inventory is 2863 units. However, 834 units of that pipeline (from Periods 1 and 3) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, leaving an effective 'real' pipeline of 2029 units (mostly from Period 17's large order). Demand has significantly slowed down (averaging ~113 units/period over the last 4 periods) compared to the start of the year, likely due to a seasonal shift out of 'basics' layering or saturated local demand. Given the current on-hand stock (1532) covers over 10 weeks of current demand, I will set mu_hat to a recent average to ensure no new orders are triggered while we burn through the current excess. L is set to calculated to reflect the high variance in arrival times (1-2 periods typically, but with total losses).

Period 21 (2019-07-01). The product is a 'Moa tank' (Womens Everyday Basics).

We are now in full summer where demand for basic tank tops appears lower than the spring ramp-up. On-hand inventory is 1418 units, which covers over 10 periods of current demand. Pipeline inventory is 2863 units, but 834 units from P1 and P3 are confirmed lost, leaving 2029 valid units in transit (P17 order of 1011). Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline', and the pipeline (even excluding losses) is roughly 2000 units, no new orders should be placed until physical stocks are drawn down. Lead time is stable at ~2 periods. I will set mu_hat to reflect the lower summer regime (recent_N=5) and allow the high on-hand/pipeline to naturally prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Summer demand (Cycles 15-20) has stabilized at ~110-150 units/week, down from ~300 in spring. Inventory levels are currently excessive relative to this lower demand signal.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (fitted vest top) has entered a stable low-demand summer regime. Historical demand from Periods 17 to 21 has averaged ~108 units per week (124, 92, 122, 114, 89). Current on-hand inventory is 1329 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers approximately 12 weeks of sales. Furthermore, the pipeline inventory is heavily inflated at 2863 units; this includes 834 units from Periods 1 and 3 that are confirmed lost (as noted in carry-over insights) and a large order of 1011 units from Period 17 that has not yet arrived but will further increase the surplus if it does. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($19.00) and the extreme overstock position, the objective is to prevent any further ordering. I am setting L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to a very low value relative to the current inventory (on-hand + pipeline) to ensure the base stock calculation does not trigger an order. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the current summer demand of ~110 units/week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-15. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime (avg ~100 units/week) compared to the spring peaks. On-hand inventory is 1,255 units, which is significantly higher than the projected demand for the review plus lead time period (approx 3 * 100 = 300 units). In-transit inventory stands at 2,863 units, but 834 of these (Orders from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost/overdue. Even subtracting these phantom units, the pipeline remains very large. To stop unnecessary ordering while the system works through this excessive stock, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the stable summer regime) and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture recent volatility. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability in delivery times (1-2 periods). The base stock calculation by the OR engine will properly result in zero new orders given the high current inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-195.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22), the product (Womens fitted vest top) is experiencing a seasonality-driven demand decline. Demand has consistently dropped over the last 6 periods from ~120 to 53 units. The current on-hand inventory (1202) is extremely high relative to this new demand regime, representing roughly 10-15 weeks of stock. Furthermore, the pipeline (2863) is heavily inflated by the 834 units known to be lost since February (P1, P3), plus large orders from P16/P17 that are likely arriving or accounted for. Given the unit profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1), the critical priority is to avoid ordering any additional units while on-hand stock is processed. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=6 to reflect the lower summer demand (~80 units/week), which, combined with the high on-hand and in-transit figures, will ensure the OR backend's capped policy results in a zero order (ordering = max(0, base_stock - pipeline)). No additional explicit overrides are needed now that physical stock is restored and excessive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: July demand has declined significantly to <100 units/week, down from spring averages of ~300. 834 units from P1/P3 remain permanently lost in pipeline data.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (fitted vest top) has entered a low-demand summer phase. Demand in July (Periods 21-24) has dropped significantly, averaging approximately 70 units per week (89, 74, 53, 64), compared to the spring average of ~300. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 1138 units, which covers over 15 weeks of the current demand regime. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 2863 units is heavily inflated by 834 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost/overdue. Despite the lost units, the total pipeline (even adjusted) is massive relative to current demand. To avoid excessive holding costs and further over-ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current low-demand summer regime. No new orders are expected or needed for several months.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: July demand has stabilized at ~70 units/week, a significant decrease from spring levels (~300 units/week). Elevated on-hand inventory levels necessitate minimal ordering activity for the foreseeable future.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (Fitted vest top) has entered a low-demand late-summer phase. The last five periods (P21-P25) show demand of 89, 74, 53, 64, and 37 units, averaging approximately 63 units/week. This is a dramatic decline from the spring average of ~300. Current on-hand inventory is 1101 units, which covers nearly 17 weeks of supply at the current demand rate. Additionally, pipeline inventory is reported at 2863 units, though 834 of these (from P1 and P3) are long-confirmed lost. Even adjusting for lost units, the pipeline remains heavily overstocked due to large orders placed in P15-P17. Given the $1.00 holding cost versus the current low demand, the priority is to avoid any new orders. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-demand regime and L to default. With on-hand plus pipeline far exceeding the calculated base stock, the OR backend will correctly suppress further ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (fitted vest top) is experiencing a continued seasonal decline in demand as August progresses. Demand has dropped from ~300 units/week in the spring to approximately 35-40 units/week in the most recent periods. On-hand inventory is significantly high (1066 units), which, relative to the current demand of ~35-40 units, covers over 25 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. Additionally, 834 units from Period 1 and Period 3 orders remain permanently lost in the pipeline inventory according to persistent history logs (P1=337, P3=497). Since on-hand inventory is already excessive, I will maintain the base stock level low to ensure the lead-time demand plus safety stock remains below the phantom pipeline plus current on-hand levels, resulting in a zero order. I'm using recent_N for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the stable low-demand regime of July/August (avg ~58/week).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 565379001 (fitted vest top) is experiencing a significant seasonal decline as summer ends (demand has dropped from ~300 in spring to <40 units per week in August). Current on-hand inventory is 1,037 units, which at the current demand rate (~35 units/period) represents approximately 30 periods of stock. Additionally, there are 834 units permanently lost in the pipeline (Orders from P1 and P3) that incorrectly inflate 'In-transit' counts. Given the massive inventory surplus and the seasonal downturn, no new orders should be placed. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=7 to capture the low late-summer demand) and default for other parameters. This resulting base stock will be significantly lower than the current inventory (on-hand + pipeline), ensuring the OR backend correctly suppresses ordering until stock levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand (August) has bottomed out at ~30-40 units/week, significantly lower than the July average (~65 units/week) and spring levels (~300 units/week).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for the 'Fitted vest top' has continued its significant downward trend into late summer, with the most recent four periods (Period 25-28) averaging approximately 31 units per week. This is a massive decline from the spring average of ~300. On-hand inventory is currently 1013 units, which represents over 30 weeks of supply at current demand levels. There is also a significant 'In-transit' figure of 2863 units, which includes 834 units from Periods 1 and 3 that are confirmed lost/overdue and 2023 units from Periods 16 and 17. Even excluding the lost units, the pipeline and on-hand inventory are vastly excessive. My goal is to prevent any further ordering until the current surplus is consumed. I am setting L to 2 (promised), and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation remains well below the current on-hand plus pipeline total.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), the SKU is experiencing a significant late-summer/autumn demand trough. Demand has declined steadily from ~110-150 units in July to a very low average of ~20-30 units in August, hitting a low of 12 units in Period 29. With an on-hand inventory of 1001 units, we have approximately 30-50 weeks of supply based on current demand velocity. Furthermore, the pipeline inventory of 2863 units is misleading: 834 units from P1 and P3 are historically confirmed lost, meaning the 'active' pipeline is approximately 2029 units (including the P17 order of 1011 units yet to arrive). Regardless of the phantom inventory, the current physical stock is massively excessive for the current demand regime. To prevent additional holding costs, mu_hat is set to 0 to ensure the OR backend places no new orders until the excess stock is liquidated. L is set to calculate to maintain data-driven leads, though no orders will be triggered.

Carry-over insight: September demand has entered a trough phase, with Period 29 demand dropping to 12 units; on-hand inventory levels (1001) are currently sufficient for over 30 periods of demand at this rate.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Fitted vest top', a seasonal summer/basics item. As of Period 31 (Sept 9), we are in a clear post-summer trough. Demand has drastically declined from ~300 units/week in the spring to a current 4-week average of ~19 units/week. On-hand inventory is 985 units, which covers nearly 50 periods of demand at the current rate. Additionally, the pipeline inventory contains 834 units from Period 1 and 3 (confirmed lost) and 2023 units from more recent orders (Period 16, 17) which are now redundant. With the current service level requirement, there is no need to order. Parameters are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect this low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend sees the massive surplus and does not trigger new orders.

Carry-over insight: September demand trough confirmed: Demand has averaged ~19 units over the last 4 periods (P27-P30), representing a >90% decrease from spring peak. On-hand inventory is extremely high relative to current demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '565379001' (Womens Everyday Basics Fitted Vest Top) is experiencing a severe seasonal demand decline as it moves into the autumn/winter transition (September). Demand has stabilized at a trough level, averaging ~16 units/week over the last 5 periods (P27-P31). Currently, on-hand inventory is 972 units, which represents approximately 60 weeks of supply at current demand rates. There are also 2,863 units in-transit (of which 834 are confirmed lost from P1/P3, and ~2,023 are from large catch-up orders in P15-P17). Given the extreme excess of inventory relative to demand, no new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime, and L to 'calculate' based on historic performance. The resulting base stock will be significantly lower than the current pipeline + on-hand, suppressing any further ordering while minimizing holding cost risk.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019), demand for the 'Moa tank' (fitted vest top) has bottomed out in a clear seasonal trough. Demand in Period 32 was only 6 units, and the average over the last 4 periods is ~12 units/week, a >95% decrease from the spring peak (~300 units/week). Current on-hand inventory (966 units) is enough to cover roughly 80 weeks of demand at the current rate. Furthermore, there are 2,863 units in-transit (though 834 are confirmed lost from P1/P3). Because on-hand inventory + reliable pipeline inventory (approx 2000 units) is massive compared to current and foreseeable demand, I must continue to prevent any new orders. The OR backend uses a pipeline inventory check: final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap). To ensure no order is placed, I set mu_hat to its minimum possible values using the recent demand of the last 4 periods (N=4), which will result in a base_stock significantly lower than the current pipeline inventory. I maintain the promised lead time (L=2) as recent arrivals have been consistent with 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand trough has deepened in September: demand dropped to 6 units in Period 32, with a 4-period average of ~12 units/week. Inventory levels remain extremely excessive.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30, 2019), the demand for this SKU (Moa tank/Fitted vest top) has bottomed out during the autumn transition, following a steady decline since spring/summer peaks. Demand over the last 4 periods has averaged only 11.75 units per week (16, 13, 6, 12). On-hand inventory is currently 954 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 80 periods. Furthermore, the pipeline inventory contains 2,863 units, of which 834 (from Periods 1 and 3) are confirmed lost, leaving a reachable pipeline of 2,029 units. Given the extreme surplus of on-hand inventory relative to the current demand trough and the high likelihood of a seasonal exit for this vest top, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the most recent local demand average (approx. 14 units/week). This will result in a base stock level significantly lower than current on-hand/pipeline levels, ensuring no new orders are placed and minimizing further holding costs while the excess stock is naturally depleted.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. The product is a 'Moa tank/fitted vest top', which is seasonally relevant for spring/summer but experiences a significant decline in autumn/winter. We are currently in a deep demand trough that began in September. Demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has been extremely low: 16, 13, 6, 12, 11 (average ~12 units/week). Our current on-hand inventory is 943 units, which at the current demand rate would last over 70 weeks. Additionally, there are 2863 units in-transit (though 834 of these are confirmed lost from P1/P3). Given the extreme excess of inventory relative to the current seasonal demand, no additional orders are necessary. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters using an explicit method at very low levels to ensure the OR backend's capped policy results in zero orders, while acknowledging the established lead time of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains at trough levels (~12 units/week), consistent with seasonal decline for vest tops in autumn. On-hand inventory represents a multi-year supply at current rates.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019. Demand for the Moa tank (a vest top/sleeveless garment) has settled into a very low seasonal trough, averaging approximately 10-12 units per week over the last five periods (P31-P35). With an on-hand inventory of 932 units, we have enough stock to cover nearly 80 weeks of demand at the current rate. Additionally, there are 2,863 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline, which includes the 834 lost units from P1 and P3, further inflating the perceived inventory. Given the massive surplus and the seasonal nature of the product, no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (last 5 periods) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains far below our current on-hand and pipeline levels, effectively suppressing any new orders while minimizing holding cost exposure.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21, 2019. Demand for this vest top SKU remains at its seasonal trough, with the most recent demand being 10 units and the 4-period average (P33-P36) at approximately 11 units/week. On-hand inventory is 922 units, which is enough to cover over 80 weeks of demand at the current rate. Furthermore, the pipeline (In-transit) is reported as 2863 units, though 834 of those are long-confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 and 3. Regardless of the pipeline errors, the physical stock is vastly excessive for the current demand regime. The objective remains to prevent all new ordering to minimize further holding costs. I will maintain L=2 (promised), and use a small 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) and sigma_hat (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand environment. Since the base_stock calculated from these will be significantly lower than the current inventory, no new orders will be generated by the OR backend.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 28, 2019. Demand for this vest top SKU remains in a deep seasonal trough, consistent with late autumn/early winter. Recent demand (P33-P37) has been extremely stable and low, averaging 11.2 units per week. The current on-hand inventory of 910 units is vastly excessive, representing approximately 80 weeks of cover at current demand rates. Additionally, the pipeline inventory (2863 units) is inflated by historical lost shipments (834 units from P1/P3) and large orders placed during the spring stockout recovery. Given the massive inventory surplus and the low-demand regime, the goal remains to prevent further ordering. I will continue using a recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the current trough, and default for others. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic will correctly suppress any new orders because on-hand + pipeline far exceeds the computed base stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '565379001' (Womens Fitted vest top) is currently in a deep seasonal trough as of November 4th, 2019. Demand has stabilized at extremely low levels (averaging ~10 units/week over the last 8 periods) reflecting typical autumn/winter seasonality for sleeveless tops. On-hand inventory (899 units) is massive relative to this demand rate, covering approximately 90 weeks of supply. Although the 'In-transit' figure (2863) is highly inflated due to historical lost shipments (834 units from P1/P3) and older orders, no new ordering is required or desired. We use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=8 to capture this current stable trough regime, which will result in a base stock level far below our current on-hand inventory, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed by the OR backend.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Moa tank/fitted vest top', which is highly seasonal. We are now in Period 40 (mid-November). Demand has remained at a persistent seasonal trough for the last several months. Specifically, the average demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 10.8 units per week. The on-hand inventory is currently 893 units, which, at the current demand rate, covers over 80 periods of demand. Furthermore, even with 834 units from Period 1 and Period 3 confirmed lost, the reported in-transit inventory of 2863 is massive. No new orders should be placed until inventory levels are reduced by orders of magnitude. The priority is to avoid additional holding costs for this seasonal item during the winter trough. I will use the recent demand regime (last 10 periods) to set parameters, though the backend will naturally refrain from ordering due to the high on-hand and pipeline levels.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand floor confirmed: Demand has stabilized at ~11 units/week desde Period 30, reflecting a terminal seasonal low for the vest top category.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 18, 2019. Demand for this vest top (565379001) has reached its seasonal floor, averaging ~9 units per week over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) and only 5 units in the most recent period. On-hand inventory is 888 units, which, at current demand rates, covers nearly 100 weeks of supply. Furthermore, there is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 2863 units, which includes 834 units known to be lost (from P1 and P3) and 2023 units from orders placed during the spring stockout (P15-P17). Even excluding the lost units, the pipeline and on-hand inventory are extremely excessive given the autumn/winter demand. No ordering is required. Using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat captures the current low-demand regime (~9 units/week) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation remains far below the existing inventory, preventing unnecessary orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 42 (late November), and demand for this vest top SKU has reached a seasonal minimum, with Period 41 recording only 1 unit of demand. The 10-period average is approximately 8.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 887 units, which is enough to cover current demand levels for over 100 weeks. Pipeline inventory (2863 units) is heavily distorted by the 834 units confirmed lost in early 2019 (P1, P3) and a large order from P17 that may still be partially reflected or simply irrelevant given the current stock levels. The OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally result in zero orders because the on-hand inventory (887) far exceeds any reasonable base stock level calculated from recent demand. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to lock in the low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the system remains in a 'no-order' state to minimize further holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor further depressed: Period 41 demand dropped to 1 unit, with the 5-period average (P37-P41) falling to ~7 units/week compared to the ~11 units/week average established in October.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the SKU (women's vest top) is in a deep seasonal trough. Demand has averaged approximately 7 units/week over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), and the on-hand inventory of 874 units is extremely high, covering over 100 weeks of current demand. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 2863 units includes the 834 units confirmed lost in early 2019 (P1, P3) and 2023 units from orders in P10, P15, P16, and P17 that are effectively lost or permanently delayed given the time elapsed. To prevent the OR backend from ordering more based on 'phantom' demand or high variance, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 13 periods (approx. 3 months) to capture the current stable low-demand regime (~10 units/week). L is set to default as lead time is not a constraint given the massive overstock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019 (Period 44). The product is a 'fitted vest top', which is experiencing its seasonal demand floor. Demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has averaged 5.4 units per week, significantly lower than the ~11 units/week seen in October. On-hand inventory is 872 units, which at the current demand rate represents over 160 weeks of supply. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. The pipeline inventory still includes 834 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost; however, given the massive inventory surplus, these phantoms do not impact decision-making. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and prevent any further ordering by maintaining default lead time settings and applying a recent_N (N=14) window to capture the sustained autumn/winter demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed: Demand from P30 to P43 has averaged ~8.5 units/week, with the most recent 5 weeks (P39-P43) averaging only 5.4 units/week, indicating a terminal seasonal low for the vest top category.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'vest top' (women's everyday basic), which is highly seasonal towards summer. Current date is December 16 (Period 45), indicating we are at the deepest part of the winter demand trough. Demand has been extremely low, with only 2 units sold in each of the last two periods and a 5-week average of 4.6 units. On-hand inventory is 870 units, which covers approximately 189 weeks of demand at the current rate. In-transit inventory includes 834 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost/overdue from early 2019, plus 1011 units from Period 17 that appear to have been mismanaged or lost given they are months overdue. Because on-hand inventory is massively excessive relative to current winter demand and the game is approaching its final periods (P47), no new orders are required. The OR engine parameters are set to reflect the current terminal low demand regime to ensure it does not trigger unnecessary orders against the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. The product (Womens Vest Top) is in a deep seasonal trough. Recent demand (P41-P45) has been extremely low: 1, 13, 2, 2, 23, averaging approximately 8 units/week. While Period 45 saw a slight uptick (23 units), this is likely minor noise or a small holiday-related bump (though tank tops typically don't peak in winter). On-hand inventory is 847 units, which covers over 100 weeks of demand at the current rate. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 834 units known to be lost (P1, P3). Given the massive inventory surplus relative to the current demand regime (~8 units/week), no new orders are required. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable, low-demand winter baseline established since September, allowing the service level to be met naturally by the existing surplus without triggering unnecessary holding costs from new orders.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. Demand for this vest top SKU remains in a seasonal winter trough. Recent demand (P42-P46) has fluctuated slightly (13, 2, 2, 23, 12 units) but averages approximately 10.4 units per week, consistent with the established autumn/winter demand floor of ~10 units/week. On-hand inventory is 835 units, which provides over 80 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. There is also a massive pipeline inventory (2863 units), though 834 of these are confirmed lost (from P1 and P3). Regardless of the 'phantom' pipeline, the physical on-hand stock is extremely excessive. We continue to set parameters to ensure no new orders are placed, allowing the system to slowly deplete the surplus inventory. Since the holding cost is $1/unit/period and the profit is $19, the target service level is high, but with 80+ weeks of stock, current service levels are naturally maximized without further procurement.
