Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is a 'Long T-shirt in soft jersey', a basic garment. Looking at historical demand (6, 13, 32, 49, 62), there is a clear and consistent upward trend over the last 5 weeks as we move out of winter towards spring. The promise lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the demand is accelerating, a simple average of all historical data will severely underestimate current needs. I'll use N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent high-growth regime (mean of [32, 49, 62] \u2248 47.7 per period). With a lead time of 2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (current + L). (1+2)*47.7 \u2248 143. For sigma_hat, N=3 provides a more reactive measure of recent volatility compared to the full history. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the trend and lead time risk.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic jersey long T-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend leading into February: 6, 13, 32, 49, 62, and finally 38 in Period 1 (though demand in Period 1 was partially unmet due to 0 starting on-hand). The average demand over the last 4 weeks is approximately 45 units per week. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand levels while ignoring the very low initial weeks from early January which likely represent a different seasonal regime. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 2 as there is no evidence yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing a basic jersey long T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend (6, 13, 32, 49, 62) and recent gameplay confirms this with demand of 38 (P1) and 73 (P2). The current date is late February, approaching the spring season when T-shirt demand typically accelerates. I am forecasting a mean demand of 85 for the upcoming periods. Promised lead time is 2, meaning orders placed in P1 and P2 are still in transit and expected to arrive in P3 and P4 respectively (corroborated by the 140 units in-transit). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set the base stock level for the (L+1)=3 periods of interest (85 * 3 = 255). This ensures the OR engine covers the aggressive growth trend and seasonal transition. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility seen in the rapid demand ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Significant upward demand trend confirmed: 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-18 saw demand grow from 6 to 73 units/week. Spring seasonality for T-shirts surfacing.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 (Long T-shirt) is currently entering its spring season, with demand history showing a clear upward trend from 6 units (early Jan) to 73 units (mid-Feb). Recent demand has fluctuated (38, 73, 52) around a higher mean compared to January. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 253 units in-transit. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (73 units), P2 (67 units), and P3 (113 units) have not arrived yet; however, based on the lead-time definition, P1's order is expected to arrive during P3's resolution (visible at the start of P4) and P2's order during P4. The history shows 'arrived=0' for P1-P3, which is normal for a 2-period lead time as the P1 arrival only concludes at the start of P4. For Period 4, I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the current demand regime (avg ~54) and explicit lead time L=2. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~162 units), which, accounting for the 253 units in-transit, will likely result in a 0 or small order to avoid overstocking while waiting for arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Long T-shirt', which is entering its spring/early summer peak demand season. Historical demand shows a strong upward trend from single digits in early January to a peak of 73 in mid-February, though the last two weeks have moderated (52, 30). In Period 4, the order from Period 2 arrived exactly on time (lead_time = 2), leaving us with 37 units on-hand. There are still 186 units in transit (specifically from Period 1 and Period 3). The Period 1 order (73 units) is now overdue if the lead time was exactly 2, but since the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 and the Period 1 order has not yet 'concluded', it may be slightly delayed or lost. However, we must remain aggressive given the product type and historical peaks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand regime (avg ~48) while accounting for the recent dip. Setting L to default (2) as the Period 2 order confirmed the promised lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a T-shirt, which sees increasing demand in spring. History shows a stock-out in Period 5 (demand was 37+, but only 37 were sold as inventory hit 0). We have 186 units in transit but 0 on-hand. Looking at arrivals: Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). Period 1's order of 73 units has not arrived yet (should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2), and Period 3's order of 113 units is expected in Period 5/6. Given that Period 1's order (ordered 5 weeks ago) is missing, it is likely lost. Current demand is volatile but shows a general upward trend compared to the initial weeks (Jan-Feb). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times, but mu_hat must reflect the recent trend and the stock-out in Period 5, which suggests demand is higher than 37. I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current spring levels (approx 40-50 units/week) and ensure the solver targets a high base stock to recover from the current stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (73 units) presumed lost - failed to arrive by Period 5 (L=2 promised). Demand potentially capped by stock-out in Period 5 (sold 37 of unknown demand).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25) managing a T-shirt SKU. Recent demand history shows a strong upward trend from early Jan (6 units) peaking around mid-Feb (73 units), followed by a stock-out period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The Period 1 order (73 units) is confirmed lost (exceeded L+4 periods). The Period 2 order (67 units) arrived on time in Period 4. The Period 3 order (113 units) was placed on 2019/2/25 with a promised lead time of 2, so it should have arrived in Period 5 or 6; since it is not in the Period 6 conclude message, it is currently overdue. To address the stock-out and capture the seasonal demand as we enter Spring/Summer, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (the full available game history) to capture the trend while smoothing the noise. I am maintaining L at default (2) as the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time, suggesting the lost/delayed orders might be anomalies rather than a systemic lead-time shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (113 units) is now overdue (Status: In-transit). Inventory remains at 0 for 2 consecutive periods despite non-zero demand, resulting in lost sales.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), we are facing a severe out-of-stock situation. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand data is skewed by stock-outs: Period 6 demand was 39 (0 sold), and Period 7 demand was 24 (0 sold). Both orders from Period 1 (73 units) and Period 3 (113 units) are missing/overdue. While the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4, the absence of the Period 1 and Period 3 shipments suggests significant supply chain instability. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 4 to account for these delays and to force the OR backend into a higher target stock level. For demand (mu_hat), the product (Tess Tee Jersey Basic) is entering the spring/summer peak season. Pre-stockout demand showed a strong upward trend from 6 to 73. To capture this without under-forecasting due to recent stockout-deflected demand signals, I'm using an EWMA with a gamma of 0.3 on the 12 available demand points (7 historical + 5 game history) to weigh the spring ramp-up. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the high volatility observed during the growth phase before we ran out of stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: Period 1 (73 units) and Period 3 (113 units) orders are significantly overdue (>5 periods since order for P1). Lead time is effectively higher than promised L=2.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. The Period 1 order (73 units) is now 8 periods in-transit (promised L=2), and the Period 3 order (113 units) is 6 periods in-transit. Both are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Only the Period 2 order arrived as promised. Current On-hand is 0, and In-transit is 186 units (consisting of the likely lost P1 and P3 orders). Demand has been suppressed by stockouts since Period 6. Based on historical data before the total stockout (P1-P5) and retail seasonality for t-shirts in April, demand is estimated around 40 units/week. Since the backend OR logic subtracts 'Pipeline Inventory' (currently 186) from the base stock calculation, and 186 units covers >4 weeks of demand, setting parameters to 'default' will result in 0 new orders being placed. To bypass this and force an order to replenish the empty warehouse, I am setting L=5 explicitly to reflect the observed supply chain instability. I am setting mu_hat to 240 (covering 6 periods of demand at ~40 units/week) to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the 186 'lost' units in transit, effectively triggering a 'replacement' order.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders from P1 and P3 (186 units total) are considered lost as they are >5 periods beyond promised lead time. Inventory has been at 0 for 4 consecutive periods (P5-P8) causing total lost sales.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 (Long T-shirt) is facing a severe supply chain crisis. We are currently in Period 10 (April 15), which is peak spring season for T-shirts. Historically, demand grew from 6 to 73 units/week by mid-February, then stabilized between 24-39 units even during out-of-stock periods. There are two major issues: 1) Supply Reliability: Orders from P1 (73 units) and P3 (113 units) are essentially lost (P1 is 9 periods old, P3 is 7 periods old). Only the P2 order arrived correctly at L=2. Total in-transit is 237 units, but 186 of these are likely 'ghost' inventory. 2) Stockouts: We have had 0 on-hand inventory for 5 consecutive periods (P5-P9). The last actual sale was in P5. The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be suppressed because it thinks the 186 lost units are still coming. To force an order and account for the high lead-time risk, I will set L to 5 (explicit) to reflect the observed delays and use recent_N=5 for demand (averaging ~33 units/week) to capture the stable but suppressed spring demand profile. Setting L=5 increases the target safety stock and the base-stock level to compensate for the 'ghost' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Only 1 of 4 orders placed before P9 arrived (L=2). P1 and P3 orders (total 186 units) are lost. Effective lead time for successful deliveries is extremely volatile; using L=5 for planning to buffer against frequent shipment loss.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 711053004 is highly unstable. Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (totaling 186 units) are effectively lost, as they are now 8-10 periods past their order date. Only orders from Period 2 (L=2) and Period 9 (L=1) have successfully arrived. Period 10 conclude confirms a stock-out: 51 units arrived and were immediately sold against a demand of 76, leaving 0 on-hand. The current date (April 22) is moving into peak T-shirt season. We need to ignore the 'ghost' units in-transit (186 units) which the OR backend might otherwise count toward the pipeline. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the system thinks pipeline is 186, I must set the mu_hat (target base stock) high enough to overcome this false pipeline while also covering the true demand forecast and safety stock. True demand is averaging ~45 units/period over the last 10 periods, but recent demand was 76. To trigger a replenishment despite the 186 phantom units in transit, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock plus future coverage (L=2). Expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods * ~60 units = 180 units, plus 186 to offset the lost pipeline = 366. I will set L=2 as the 'promised' lead time but use mu_hat to force the correction.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Inventory correction required. Historical orders from P1 and P3 (186 units) confirmed lost. In-transit count of 186 in system is 'phantom' inventory. Demand remains strong (76 in P10) as spring peak continues.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for item 711053004 is highly unstable. Orders from Period 1 (73 units) and Period 3 (113 units) are definitively lost (phantom inventory = 186 units). The recent order from Period 9 arrived in only 1 period, but inventory was immediately depleted by demand (P10: 76, P11: 93). Current status: 0 on-hand, 353 in-transit. Adjusting for 186 lost units, effective in-transit is only 167 (from P11). Given the seasonality of T-shirts in late April/early May and the observed demand spike (avg ~84 over last 2 periods), I must set parameters to force a large reorder to bridge the stockout. I am setting L to 5 explicitly to counteract the 'phantom' inventory in the OR engine's logic (since it subtracts pipeline inventory from its target). Scaling mu_hat to 500 covers 6 periods of demand (L+1) at approximately 83 units/week, ensuring the order is large enough to overcome the 186-unit pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory confirmed: 186 units (P1, P3) are lost and will never arrive. Demand regime shift: P10-P11 average demand is 84.5 units, significantly higher than early season averages.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing a T-shirt SKU during its peak spring/summer season. Demand has been highly volatile but generally strong, with a recent 3-period average of 74 units (ignoring potential stock-out capping). The primary challenge is extreme supply chain unreliability: orders from P1 (73 units) and P3 (113 units) totaling 186 units are officially lost, creating 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend's pipeline calculations. Because the OR backend relies on (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will under-order by 186 units unless we inflate mu_hat to compensate. To ensure we actually stock up for the current demand regime (~74 units/week) while the backend erroneously thinks we have 186 units coming, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L) * 74 + 186. With L=2 promised (actual observed recently was L=1 but unreliable), (1+2)*74 + 186 = 408. Setting L=2 explicitly to match the engine's expectation while sigma remains recent to capture the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stock-out and phantom inventory (186 units from P1/P3) continue to block automated ordering; manual inflation of mu_hat is required until pipeline clears or arrivals stabilize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $613.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 14 (May 13). Product is a T-shirt entering late spring/early summer. In Period 13, 167 units arrived (ordered in Period 11, L=2), bringing on-hand to 128 units. However, we still have 186 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from P1 and P3 that are lost. The OR engine sees 'In-transit: 316', which includes these 186 lost units plus 124 (ordered P12) and 6 (ordered P13). 

Lead Time: The most recent successful delivery (P11 order arriving P13) had L=2. While P1/P3 orders were lost, the P9 and P11 orders arrived with L=1 and L=2 respectively. I will use 'explicit' L=2 for planning.

Demand: Recent demand (P10-P13) has been 76, 93, 53, 39. The average of these 4 weeks is ~65.25. Given the seasonality of T-shirts and previous stock-outs potentially masking demand, I anticipate demand to remain robust. To counteract the 'phantom' inventory (186 units) which prevents the OR engine from ordering enough, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I want a base stock that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand plus safety stock. Target base stock ~ 3 * 70 + safety \u2248 280. Since the system thinks pipeline is 316 and on-hand is 128, it won't order unless I inflate mu_hat significantly or the pipeline clears. By setting mu_hat explicitly high (around 500-600), I can force an order if needed, but since we just received 167 units and have 130 in-transit from P12/P13, we are actually well-covered for the next 2 weeks (128 on hand + 130 expected = 258 units). I will use a mu_hat based on the recent elevated demand regime (65 units/week * 3 periods = 195) but set sigma_hat higher to account for the supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 65 units/week in the late spring period (P10-P13). Delivery reliability remains the primary risk despite recent L=2 performance.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019-05-20), on-hand inventory is 213 units following the arrival of orders from P11 and P12. The system reports an 'in-transit' count of 192 units. This 'in-transit' figure is comprised of the P13 order (6 units) and the 'phantom' inventory from P1 (73 units) and P3 (113 units) which are confirmed lost. The recent arrivals from P11 and P12 both adhered to a lead time of L=2, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized, though total delivery reliability remains a concern. Demand in the last two periods (P13, P14) has dropped to 39 units/period, down from the P10-P11 peak of ~85. This suggests the spring peak is tapering off. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P10-P14) to capture this recent cooling while maintaining a healthy buffer against the phantom inventory which currently suppresses the OR backend's order generation. I will maintain L=2 as the basis for calculations as current deliveries have returned to the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering: Post-spring peak demand (P13-P14) has stabilized at 39 units/week, a ~50% decrease from the P10-P11 peak of 84.5 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/27. The demand for 'Tess Tee' (a T-shirt SKU) has tapered significantly from its spring peak (which averaged ~85 units in P11-P12) to a stable late-spring regime. Over the last three periods (P13-P15), demand has been exceptionally stable at 39, 39, and 38 units respectively. I will set mu_hat based on this recent 3-period regime to reflect the post-peak stabilization. In-transit inventory reflects 192 units, but 186 of these are from P1 and P3 and have been confirmed lost for several periods (they are >10 periods late). These 'phantom' units are blocking the OR backend's ability to order because it believes the pipeline is full. To compensate for the pipeline inventory being over-reported by 186 units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the stabilized demand (40 units/period) across (L+1) periods (where L=2). Base stock = (2+1) * 40 = 120 units. However, because the backend sees 192 units in-transit and 175 on-hand, it thinks pipeline inventory is 367. To neutralize this and ensure no unnecessary orders are placed while on-hand is high, but to prepare for when units are needed, I will set mu_hat to reflect the current mean. Since on-hand (175) is already above the required base stock (120), no order will be triggered, which is correct given the current surplus and demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~39 units/week for 3 consecutive periods (P13-P15), down from the P10-P11 peak of 84.5.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. We are exiting the spring peak and entering a stable early summer demand regime. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 16 (86 units), which contrasts with the 39 units/week average observed in Periods 13-15. This suggests that while base demand has stabilized, there is high volatility or occasional promotional spikes. Inventory status: On-hand is 89 units. In-transit is 192 units, but this includes 'phantom' inventory of 186 units from lost orders in Periods 1 and 3 (unresolved since early spring). Realistic pipeline is only 6 units (ordered Period 13). Lead time analysis: Successful deliveries (Periods 11 and 12) consistently arrived in 2 periods. To manage the spike in Period 16 while accounting for the lower mean of the preceding weeks, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the blend of the recent spike and the prior stability. To protect against the 'phantom' pipeline inventory blocking new orders, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to slightly stretch the base stock calculation, ensuring we maintain a buffer despite the system thinking we have 186 units coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Volatility confirmed in post-peak regime; P16 saw a spike to 86 units after three weeks of ~39 units. Pipeline remains corrupted by 186 units of phantom inventory from P1/P3.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is currently out of stock after a massive demand spike of 180 units in Period 17 (2019/6/3). This spike suggests a late-season peak for T-shirts or a specific promotional event. Looking at the history, demand has been highly volatile, with a regime average of ~39 units (P13-P15) suddenly jumping to 86 (P16) and 180 (P17). Total demand in the last two weeks was 266 units. The pipeline inventory is currently 192, but 186 units of this are confirmed 'phantom' units from P1 and P3 that were never delivered. This means the 'real' in-transit inventory is essentially zero. To trigger an order that overrides the phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the phantom 186 units plus expected demand over the lead time. Given the recent spike, I am forecasting a mean of ~130 units/period (average of P16 and P17) and using L=2 (the consistent lead time for successful deliveries P11-P12). Thus, base stock targets (1+L)*mu_hat must be significantly greater than 186 to generate a meaningful order.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand surge detected: P17 demand (180) is the highest historical value, following a P16 jump (86), suggesting a significant late-Spring/Early-Summer peak. Phantom inventory (186 units) continues to mask the true stock-out situation in automated logic.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a major demand surge (Summer peak for T-shirts), with demand jumping from ~40 to 180 and 141 in the last two periods. The pipeline is currently heavily corrupted by 186 units of phantom inventory from P1 and P3 which are long-lost, meaning the OR backend thinks we have more stock coming than we actually do. To force an order and overcome this 'phantom' supply, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual expected demand. The real average demand for this new regime (P17-P18) is ~160. Accounting for L=2 (3 periods total), the base stock should be ~480. Since the system subtracts the 'In-transit' (398, including 186 phantom units) from the base stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 600. This ensures the backend places an order to bridge the gap between real stock needs and the false pipeline measurements, while protecting against lost sales in this high-demand window.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: demand for P17-P18 averaged 160 units/week (+300% vs previous regime). Phantom inventory from P1/P3 remains in the 398 'In-transit' count, requiring mu_hat inflation to trigger replacement orders.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is experiencing a strong Summer peak (Late June). Recent demand for P17-P19 has been 180, 141, and 187 respectively (average ~170). The current 'In-transit' count of 440 includes 186 units of phantom inventory from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost. To trigger an order, the OR backend's target base_stock must exceed the perceived pipeline (effective pipeline = 440 - 186 = 254 units). With lead time L=2, the base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~510 units). Using mu_hat = 600 via the 'explicit' method ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to bypass the phantom inventory barrier and replenish stock for the current localized demand peak. sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high volatility observed in P17-P19.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for Summer peak (June): Demand for P17-P19 averaged 169.3 units, compared to the previous regime of ~39. Supply chain remains unstable with 186 units of permanent phantom inventory (P1, P3) distorting pipeline calculations.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 21 (2019/07/01) with the Summer demand peak for T-shirts firmly established. Demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) has averaged 163.75 units (180, 141, 187, 147). However, the system's pipeline inventory calculation is severely corrupted by 186 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders in Periods 1 and 3, which remain in the 'In-transit' count (currently 713). This phantom inventory tricks the OR engine into ordering less than needed because it thinks those 186 units are coming. To force the engine to place a larger order that covers the current demand regime despite this phantom offset, I am manually inflating the mu_hat parameter. I setting it to (1+L) * 230, where 230 is ~40% higher than the current average. This creates a large enough base stock to trigger an order today. Actual lead times have been 1-2 periods recently, so L=2 is appropriate as a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (June/July) confirmed: average demand is 164 units/week based on P17-P20. Phantom inventory from P1/P3 (186 units) continues to artificially inflate the pipeline inventory count.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting the height of the summer demand peak for t-shirts. Demand over the last five periods (P17-P21) has averaged 164.4 units, representing a sustained high-demand regime. However, the system's pipeline inventory is significantly distorted by 186 units of phantom inventory from lost orders in P1 and P3 (73 + 113 units) that have never arrived and are now ~20 periods overdue. The current In-transit count of 805 units includes these 186 phantom units effectively masking a stock-out. To force the OR backend to order despite this phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. My target base stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 (promised) and current demand at ~165, base stock should be ~495. To bypass the 186 phantom units, I am inflating mu_hat to 681 (495 target + 186 phantom offset) to ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic triggers a replenishment order that accounts for actual needs. L is set to 'calculate' as arrival times (P18 arrived in 1 period, P11 and P12 in 2 periods) have stabilized recently.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (June/July) confirmed: average demand is 164.4 units/week (P17-P21). Supply chain shows two distinct lost shipments from P1 and P3 (186 units total) which remain as 'phantom' in-transit inventory, requiring periodic mu_hat inflation to maintain stock levels.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, representing the peak summer demand for 'Long T-shirts'. The demand regime for the summer peak (P17-P22) has averaged 154 units per week, despite a slight dip to 103 in P22. Crucially, the system still carries 186 units of 'phantom inventory' from Period 1 (73 units) and Period 3 (113 units) which are confirmed lost but stay in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 532, Actual In-transit: 346). To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 186 phantom units. The logic is: Base Stock = (1+L) * mu_hat. To induce an order of 'X', the Base Stock must exceed (On-hand + Pipeline). By setting mu_hat explicitly to encompass the expected demand for 3 periods (L+1) plus the 186 phantom units, we bypass the pipeline distortion. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (154 * 3) + 186 \u2248 648. Therefore, I set mu_hat (which the backend treats as (1+L)*mean) to an explicit value that achieves this target coverage. Given the volatility (P17: 180, P22: 103), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to maintain a high service level during the peak.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-22. We are in the summer peak period for T-shirts. Demand for the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has averaged 136 units/week, showing a slight cooling from the peak 180s but still significantly higher than the spring average. The 'In-transit' count of 469 is heavily distorted by 'phantom' inventory: 186 units from P1 and P3 are definitely lost (over 20 periods late). Additionally, the order from P19 (248 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised L=2), and given the history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P19), it is highly likely lost as well. Total 'phantom' inventory is likely 186 + 248 = 434 units. Removing these from the reported 469 in-transit leaves only ~35 units of actual pending orders (likely the P23 order of 29 units). With 186 on hand and demand around 136, we have roughly 1.3 weeks of stock. To counter the OR engine's 'inventory-rich' perception (due to phantom pipeline) and trigger an order, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at a mean of 136 as ~408 units. To force an order despite the 469 in-transit, I set mu_hat (which the OR uses as target inventory) to 750. This accounts for the 434 lost units plus desired stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Order from Period 19 (248 units) confirmed as likely lost (4 periods beyond promised L=2). Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory is now 434 units (P1: 73, P3: 113, P19: 248). Late-summer demand (July) is averaging 136 units/week.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we are in a high-demand late-summer regime. Demand in P24 was significant (188 units), causing a stock-out. The 'In-transit' count of 695 is heavily corrupted by 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments that were likely lost but remain on the books. Specifically, orders from P1 (73), P3 (113), and now P19 (248) are missing well beyond their lead times, totaling 434 units of phantom stock. The backend OR logic subtracts the full 695 units from its target (base stock) when calculating the next order. With current demand averaging 138 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) and an L=2, the base stock would normally be ~414. If it sees 695 in transit, it will order 0, leading to a prolonged stock-out. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, manually inflating the target to approximately (Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Stock. Calculation: (138 * 3) + 434 \u2248 848. I will set mu_hat to 850 and sigma_hat to 100 to account for recent high volatility (demands of 76 vs 188). This forces the backend to place an order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated to 434 units (P1: 73, P3: 113, P19: 248) as of Period 25. Demand remains volatile at the end of summer, with P24 showing a spike to 188 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is currently in a high-demand late-summer regime. The average demand for the last 9 periods (P17-P25) is approximately 144 units per week, though volatility is high (range 76-188). In-transit inventory stands at 1015, but this includes significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (73), P3 (113), and now likely P19 (248), totaling 434 units that will not arrive. Subtracting these from the 1015 reported in-transit units gives a real pipeline of 581 units (from orders in P20, P21, P23, P24, P25). However, P20 (273) and P21 (92) already arrived in P22 and P23. This leaves active orders from P23 (29), P24 (226), and P25 (320) totaling 575 real units in transit. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is ~144/week, we must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to override the OR engine's pipeline check, which is being misled by the 434 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) period to 432 (144 * 3) and adding the 434 phantom units to ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic triggers an order if needed, though currently, the active 575 units should cover the next ~4 weeks once they arrive. I will use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P20, P21) were on time.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) in-transit inventory remains at 434 units as of Period 26 (P1: 73, P3: 113, P19: 248). These units will never arrive and must be manually accounted for by inflating mu_hat or sigma_hat to ensure the backend places orders despite the inflated pipeline count.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are in the late-summer period. Demand has been volatile but shows a general cooling trend from the June peak (average ~130-140 in July vs ~170 in June). The system has a critical 'phantom inventory' issue: orders from P1 (73), P3 (113), and P19 (248) are confirmed lost, totaling 434 units that currently inflate the 'In-transit' count (986 units). Real in-transit is 986 - 434 = 552. To force the backend to place orders despite this 434-unit inflation, I must inflate mu_hat. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaged 110.4 units. Expected demand for lead time + review period (3 weeks) at that rate is ~331 units. To counteract the 434 units of phantom inventory blocking the pipeline, I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of required safety stock (~450 units base stock) plus the phantom offset (434), totaling 884. This ensures the backend (capped policy) triggers orders to replenish actual on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak transition: Average demand in July (P22-P26) cooled to 110.4 units/week from June's 160+. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 434 units (P1, P3, P19).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 (Aug 19), demand is in a post-summer cooling phase. July/August demand (P22-P27) has averaged 105.1 units/week, a significant drop from the June peak of 160+. The pipeline contains 434 units of 'phantom' inventory (P1, P3, P19) that are effectively lost but still factored in by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 241 and a systemic pipeline of 689 (434 phantom + 226 from P24 + 23 from P27 + 6 from P13), the backend would normally stop ordering. To force replenishment for the current demand regime of ~105 units/week, I must set mu_hat to cover both the target base stock and the phantom units. Target base stock for L=2 (3 periods) at 105 units/week is ~315 units. Adding 434 phantom units yields a required mu_hat of ~749. I will use 750 to ensure the policy clears the phantom hurdle and maintains availability as we head toward the end of summer.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand (Aug) has stabilized at ~105 units/week (P22-P27 average), down from the June peak of 160+. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 434 units (P1, P3, P19).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for the T-shirt SKU has cooled from its June/July peak (~160+ units) to a fairly stable late-summer regime averaging 105.4 units per week (periods 22-28). The supply chain remains a significant concern: we have documented 'phantom' in-transit inventory totaling 434 units (P1: 73, P3: 113, P19: 248) which are lost and will never arrive, but still appear in the 'In-transit' count of 689. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a healthy pipeline and refusing to order, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 434 phantom units. Currently, on-hand is 176 and true in-transit is 255 (689 - 434). Baseline mu_hat for L=2 (3 periods of demand) at 105.4 units/week would be ~316. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered despite the 434-unit inflation in the backend's pipeline calculation, I set a mu_hat value that accounts for (1+L)*demand + phantom_offset. Target mu_hat = 316 + 434 = 750. I will use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the current regime's volatility and 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals (P23, P25) have trended toward the promised 2-3 period window.

Carry-over insight: End of Summer demand regime (August) stabilized at 105.4 units/week (P22-P28), a significant drop from the June peak of 160+. Total confirmed phantom in-transit inventory is 434 units (P1: 73, P3: 113, P19: 248).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. We are entering the post-summer/early-autumn period. Demand has stabilized over the last month (P26-P29) at an average of 70.75 units, a decrease from the summer peak but significantly higher than the spring baseline. The supply chain has a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: 434 units (P1: 73, P3: 113, P19: 248) are confirmed as lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (694 total - 434 phantom = 260 real in-transit). With 115 on-hand and 260 real in-transit, the total real position is 375. The OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' figure of 694. To ensure the backend places orders to cover the next (L+1) periods of demand (~3 periods x 71 units = 213), I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 434 phantom units. I will set mu_hat to 650 (approx 213 + 434) using the explicit method to force the backend to maintain stock despite the corrupted pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 (P25-P29) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: End of Summer demand (August) confirmed at ~71 units/week (P26-P29). Phantom in-transit inventory remains 434 units (P1, P3, P19), requiring mu_hat inflation of ~434 units relative to expected lead-time demand to bypass the OR engine's pipeline check.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9th, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (June/July avg ~160) to a post-peak late-summer/early-autumn regime (August/September avg ~70). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 69 units. The supply chain continues to present significant challenges with 'phantom' pipeline inventory. We have confirmed 434 units of lost shipments from Period 1 (73), Period 3 (113), and Period 19 (248). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (671 units total) but will never arrive. To bypass the OR engine's pipeline check (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat. Theoretical base stock for a lead time of 2 should be (1+L)*demand = 3*70 = 210. Adding the 434 phantom units requires mu_hat to be ~644 to trigger any ordering. However, given 76 units on-hand and 237 units of actual valid in-transit (671 - 434), we have 313 real units available, which covers roughly 4.5 weeks of current demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the actual demand regime while acknowledging the phantom inventory will block orders for several periods until the system 'catches up' naturally or stock levels drop further.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (Sept) confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~69 units/week (P26-P30). Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 434 units (P1, P3, P19).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019-09-16), we are in a post-summer demand regime. Demand from P26-P31 has averaged 77.0 units/week. The total 'In-transit' count is 671, which includes significant 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments that will never arrive). Confirmed lost orders include P1 (73), P3 (113), and P19 (248), totaling 434 units. Recent arrivals (P27 and P30) confirm a variable lead time of 2-3 periods. To counteract the backend's capped policy which would stop ordering due to the 671 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~77 units/week (approx 231 units) and add the 434 phantom units to 'bypass' the pipeline check, resulting in a value of 665. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the volatility of the post-summer period.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand (Sept) currently averaging 77 units/week (P26-P31). Total phantom inventory remains 434 units. Lead time variability (2-3 periods) persists.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). We are transitioning out of the summer peak into autumn. Recent demand (P26-P32) has stabilized at an average of 75.5 units/week. The primary operational challenge remains the 434 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (P1: 73, P3: 113, P19: 248) which are lost but still counted by the OR engine. This phantom inventory prevents the backend from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the current demand regime (~76 units/week) and a lead time of 2, then add the 434 phantom units to that target. This 'inflated' mu_hat forces the OR engine to place orders despite the illusory stock in the pipeline. With a desired base stock of (L+1)*demand = 3*76 = 228, plus the 434 phantom units, the target mu_hat should be approximately 662.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is currently in a post-summer demand regime (September), where demand has stabilized around 80 units/week (P31-P33 average is 88, P26-P33 average is 77). The supply chain remains problematic due to 'phantom inventory': orders from P1 (73), P3 (113), P19 (248), and now P24 (226) are highly likely lost as they are far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods. Total phantom inventory is now 660 units (73+113+248+226). This phantom inventory is included in the 'In-transit' count (715), which prevents the OR engine from ordering since it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To trigger a replenishment order that covers (L+1) periods of demand while overcoming the 660-unit pipeline distortion, I calculate the required base stock: (1+L) * Demand + Phantom Inventory. With L=2 and average demand ~85, base stock should be (3 * 85) + 660 = 915. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=8 to capture the current volatility while ignoring the massive June spikes.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) in-transit inventory increased to 660 units as of Period 34 (P1: 73, P3: 113, P19: 248, P24: 226). These units are effectively lost and will not arrive, necessitating mu_hat inflation to bypass the OR engine's pipeline checks. Post-summer demand has stabilized between 75-90 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is currently in a post-summer demand regime (Sept/Oct) with demand averaging approximately 70-80 units per week. However, the system faces a massive pipeline corruption issue: 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 958 units, but historically, at least 660 units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P19, P24). Specifically, P1 and P3 (186 units) were lost months ago, P19 (248 units) is 15 periods overdue, and P24 (226 units) is now 10 periods overdue against a promised L=2. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to determine orders; therefore, if the phantom count (660) is not accounted for, the system will never order. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to 'phantom_inventory + (1+L)*expected_demand'. With L=2 and expected demand ~75, (1+L)*demand is ~225. Adding the 660 phantom units gives a mu_hat of 885. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to exceed the 958 'In-transit' units visible to it. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture the current post-summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains at 660 units (P1, P3, P19, P24) as of Period 35. These are effectively lost shipments. Forecasted demand for Oct is stabilizing at ~75 units/week.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-summer regime, with recent observations of 39, 38, and a historical Sept/Oct profile suggesting a mean of ~75 units/week. However, the system faces a severe 'phantom inventory' issue. The current In-transit count is 914 units, but historically confirmed losses from Period 1 (73), Period 3 (113), Period 19 (248), and Period 24 (226) total 660 units. These 660 units will never arrive but are blocking the OR engine from ordering. To force an order and maintain stock levels for a lead time of 2-3 periods, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 950. This value accounts for the ~660 units of phantom inventory plus approximately 3-4 weeks of expected demand (75 * 3.5 \u2248 262). By setting mu_hat near the total pipeline (phantom + legit) plus desired coverage, I bypass the pipeline check. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 660 units (P1, P3, P19, P24). Demand for Oct 2019 is averaging ~50-75 units/week, down from the summer peak but showing stability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a lower post-summer regime, averaging ~37 units/week over the last two periods (P35-P36). The system reports 1029 units in-transit, but 660 of these are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in P1, P3, P19, and P24 (all >6 periods old). The real pipeline contains orders from P34 (243 units), P36 (115 units), and a small P29 remnant (5 units), totaling 363 units. Since 'In-transit' is 1029, the OR engine sees a surplus of 666 units. To bypass this and ensure the engine orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), I must inflate mu_hat. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~111 units (37 * 3). To offset the 660 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 771 (111 + 660). Sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for moderate demand volatility around the mean.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28, transitioning into late autumn. Historical demand for October has cooled from the summer peak, averaging 48.75 units over the last 4 weeks (P34-P37). However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 1029 is heavily corrupted by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P1 (73), P3 (113), P19 (248), and P24 (226) are confirmed lost, totaling 660 phantom units. Additionally, the order from P34 (243 units) is now 4 periods old (promised L=2) and has not arrived; if it does not arrive in P38, the phantom total will rise to 903. Currently, the OR engine sees 1029 units in transit while true on-hand is 0. To trigger a replenishment order for the current demand regime (~50-60 units/week) with a lead time of 2-3 periods, the 'base_stock' must exceed the pipeline (1029). I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 1150. This value accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus the 1029 phantom units, forcing the backend to realize an under-stock despite the massive in-transit figure. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-3 period reality, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total phantom in-transit inventory potentially increased to 903 units as the order from P34 (243 units) is now significantly overdue (4 periods). Post-summer demand regime (Oct) is confirmed at ~50 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053004 is currently facing a massive pipeline distortion due to 'phantom inventory'. As of Period 39, the system shows 1,214 units in-transit, but historical evidence suggests a large portion of this has been lost. Specifically, orders from P1 (73), P3 (113), P19 (248), P24 (226), and now P34 (243) have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 by a significant margin without arriving. Total phantom inventory is now estimated at 903 units. To trigger any order from the OR backend (which uses a base-stock formula: order = base_stock - in_transit), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 1,214 units in-transit. The current demand regime (October-November) is approximately 50 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the true lead-time demand is ~150 units (3 periods). To force an order that addresses the current stock-out (on-hand = 0), I will set mu_hat to 1,500 units (intended to cover the 1,214 phantom/real pipeline plus a survival stock of ~300). This bypasses the pipeline block caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative phantom (lost) in-transit inventory is confirmed at 903 units (Orders from P1, P3, P19, P24, P34). Current demand regime is stabilized at ~50 units/week for Nov (P35-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 40, approaching the end of the year. Demand for this Jersey T-shirt has entered a low-season/late-autumn regime, with the most recent sample at 21 units and a 4-week average (P35-P39) of approximately 40 units. The pipeline is severely corrupted by 'phantom' in-transit inventory (lost shipments). As of P39, I have identified 903 units as phantom: P1 (73), P3 (113), P19 (248), P24 (226), and P34 (243). These units are officially in-transit in the system but 4+ periods overdue based on a promised L=2 and observed L=3. Total in-transit is 1452; subtracting the 903 phantom units leaves a 'real' in-transit of 549 (P38: 185, P39: 353). These real orders are sufficient to cover the current demand regime (~40 units/week). However, to move the backend's internal base-stock target above the inflated 1452 pipeline count and prevent the capped policy from hitting zero, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate real demand at 40/week; with L=2, the required real inventory position is ~120 units. I set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the phantom inventory barrier and maintain the flow of real goods.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom (lost) in-transit inventory remains confirmed at 903 units (Orders from P1, P3, P19, P24, P34). Post-summer demand regime (Nov) is stabilized at ~40 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has dropped significantly as we transition out of the summer and early fall regimes, with late October/November (P37-P40) averaging only 35 units per week. The system reports an 'In-transit' count of 1452. However, my carry-over insights confirm that at least 903 units of this are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34). The order from P38 (185 units) is now 3 periods out (expected arrival), and the P39 order (353 units) is in-transit. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1452 in-transit units from the base stock, it will not place any new orders unless I explicitly inflate the demand forecast (mu_hat) to 'wait out' the phantom stock. I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to approximately override the 903 phantom units plus provide coverage for the current 35 units/week demand over the lead time (L+1=3). Thus, 903 + (3 * 35) \u2248 1008. Sigma_hat is set to 2.0 to account for recent demand volatility (drops and spikes).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand drop for Nov 2019: average is 35 units/week (P37-P40). Phantom in-transit remains at least 903 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Long T-shirt' has entered a late-fall/early-winter low, stabilizing at approximately 20-30 units per week (P39-P41 average is ~23). Currently, we have 400 units on hand, which is more than sufficient for the remaining 5 periods of the game, especially given the current low demand regime. There is still a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (at least 903 units from P1, P3, P19, P24, and P34 are confirmed lost or significantly overdue), plus a more recent order of 185 from P38 that has not yet arrived but is within a reasonable delivery window. Given the high on-hand stock and the low demand, no further orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand environment, allowing the backend to prioritize reducing ending inventory and avoiding further holding costs. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-3 period volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer low demand regime confirmed for Nov 2019: average demand is ~23 units/week (P39-P41). Total confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains 903 units (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34), which will likely never arrive.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand has shifted into a low-winter regime, averaging 26.3 units over the last 4 periods (P39-P42: 21, 15, 32, 27). The SKU is a 'Long T-shirt', which typically sees lower interest during winter months in the absence of holiday-specific spikes for basic jersey items. On-hand inventory is currently high (373 units) due to the large P39 order arriving just as demand dropped. The system's in-transit count is 1,099, but this contains at least 903 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P19, P24, and P34). Specifically, the P34 order (243 units) is now 8 periods old and certainly lost. Despite the phantom inventory, the current on-hand stock (373) is significantly above the required base stock for this regime (approx 26.3 * 3 = 80 units). No new orders are needed. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead time of successful deliveries (~2.5 periods). mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current stable low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed total phantom in-transit inventory is 903 units (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34). Current winter demand regime is stable at ~26 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the Winter demand regime (December), which is significantly lower than the Summer and Autumn peaks. Current demand (P41-P43) averages ~23.6 units/week. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 361) after the arrival of P39's order (353 units). The 'In-transit' count of 1099 is heavily distorted by 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P19, P24, and P34), which totals 903 units. Subtracting these lost units leaves a corrected pipeline of 196 units (P38 order of 185 + P29 order of 5 + P30/P32 remainders). Given On-hand (361) + Corrected Pipeline (196) = 557 units, we are far above the necessary base stock for a 26 unit/week demand profile. No new orders are needed. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual drift to 2-3 periods. \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 use recent_N (N=5) to capture the low winter demand trend.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in a stable winter demand regime for this T-shirt SKU, with the last 6 periods (P39-P44) showing a mean demand of approximately 19.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 349 units, which is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory, which has accumulated to 903 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34). The current In-transit total of 1099 includes these 903 lost units + the 185 units ordered in Period 38 (which is now slightly overdue at lead time 7). Since on-hand inventory is 349 and expected weekly demand is ~20, there is no need to place new orders. I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) to capture the low winter demand. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times, though no new order will be triggered regardless because the pipeline inventory (even if adjusted for phantom units) plus on-hand significantly exceeds the base stock level for this low-demand period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in a low-demand winter regime for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P42-P45) has averaged 17.75 units/week. The on-hand inventory is 329 units, which is more than enough to cover this low demand for many periods. However, the system shows an In-transit balance of 1,099 units. Based on historical analysis, 903 of these units are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34). The remaining 196 units in-transit likely stem from more recent orders that are not yet confirmed lost or have arrived. Since our current on-hand inventory (329) significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (approx 18 units/period * 3 periods = 54), no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand captures the recent stability around 20 units/week. Although phantom inventory is present, the high on-hand stock naturally prevents new orders, so explicit inflation of mu_hat is not required this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand regime for winter (Dec) remains stable at ~18 units/week. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at least 903 units (P1, P3, P19, P24, P34).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. The SKU (T-shirt) is in a stable low-demand winter regime, with recent demand (P43-P46) averaging 15 units/week. On-hand inventory is 313 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover projected demand for the next several periods (Service Level target is ~95%, requiring ~45-60 units). The 'In-transit' count of 1099 is heavily distorted by 903 units of phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P19, P24, P34). Even subtracting phantom units, the pipeline and on-hand inventory are excessive for current demand. I am setting parameters to prevent any new orders by using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the low winter demand (~15 units/week) and setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead time (avg ~3). This will ensure no orders are placed until the on-hand inventory is depleted to a rational level.
