  "rationale": "Product Description: 'Long T-shirt... cotton blend with short sleeves.' This is a basic apparel item (Jersey Basic). Date: 2019/02/11 (Early Spring/Transitional season). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend from low values (6 units) in early January to 62 units in the most recent historical period (2019/02/04). This suggests a strong pre-spring seasonal growth as customers prepare for warmer weather. Current Situation: Period 1, On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts while the first order is in transit, I need to account for demand in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 approach). Forecast: The last historical observation was 62. Assuming the growth trend continues or stabilizes, I expect demand to be around 70-80 units per period. Target pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) should cover ~220-250 units. Inventory strategy: Since I am starting at 0, I will place a significant order to build stock immediately, accounting for the 2-period lead time.",

Period 1 (Feb 11) recorded a demand of 38, slightly lower than the peak but consistent with a stabilizing or moderate demand phase before spring. In Period 1, 230 units were ordered. Since the promised lead time is 2, I expect that order to arrive physically during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current status: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 230. Since I cannot satisfy demand in Period 2 (nothing on hand) and demand is expected to be around 40-60 units per period based on recent history, I must ensure that by Period 4 (when the first order arrives) and beyond, I have enough stock. Total stock required to cover the cycle (Lead time L=2 + 1) is ~240 units (assuming ~60/week). The 230 already in transit almost covers this.

As spring begins in the Northern Hemisphere, demand for lightweight cotton basics like T-shirts typically starts to rise. (b) Historical data showed a ramp-up in Jan/Feb (from 6 to 62). In the game history, demand started high (38, 73, 52) and dipped to 30 in P4. The average demand across these 4 game periods is approx 48. Given the seasonal transition into spring, I expect demand to hover between 50-70 units per period. (c) At the start of P5, we have confirmation from P4 conclude that the P2 order arrived with a lead time of 2. The P1 order (230 units) is now 1 period overdue (promised 2, currently at 3+ since P1 conclude). There is a significant risk that the P1 order is lost. (d) Current state: On-hand 30.

The mean is approximately 34 units/period. The initial historical spikes in Jan/Feb (up to 62) seem to have settled into a lower, stable regime. c) Lead Time & Reliability: Internal logistics are highly unreliable. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are clearly lost (overdue by 4+ periods). However, P5, P6, and P7 all arrived (P5 took 1 period, P6 took 2 periods, P7 took 1 period).

Given the ~50-60% loss rate observed earlier, we cannot assume all 420 units will arrive. If the P8 order (80 units) is lost, we have 139 on hand, which covers ~4 periods of demand. e) Decision: We have a large amount in transit relative to demand, but a high risk of loss.

However, the system reports 420 in-transit. This suggests that the early 'lost' orders (P1: 230, P3: 50, P4: 60) plus the P8 (80) order are being counted in the pipeline (230+50+60+80 = 420).
