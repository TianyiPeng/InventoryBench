Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU 618800001 is a 'V-neck satin top with lace trim', categorized under 'Womens Everyday Collection'. This is a staple item but influenced by spring fashion trends. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks is [148, 133, 150, 139, 160], showing a stable trend with a slight uptick in the most recent week. The mean is 146 and the standard deviation is approximately 10.3. The promised lead time is 2. To cover the review period (1) plus lead time (2), we need to forecast for 3 periods (1+L=3). Base stock should be around 146 * 3 = 438, plus a safety buffer. Using the 'default' methods will naturally use all available historical data to set the initial base stock. No lead-time or demand regime shifts can be confirmed yet as it is the first period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 2. The first order of 164 units was placed in Period 1. Based on the promised lead time (L=2), this order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 144 units of demand were lost in Period 1 due to no stock. The historical demand samples (148, 133, 150, 139, 160) plus Period 1 demand (144) show a very stable mean of approximately 145.6 units per week. The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a spring/summer staple; mid-February is the start of the spring retail season, so demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase. I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for demand to capture recent stability and the default lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the low historical volatility (std dev \u2248 9.5).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (seed + P1/P2) shows: 148, 133, 150, 139, 160, 144, 165. The mean is approx 148.4 with a standard deviation of approx 11.5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed P1) hasn't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the P1 order (164 units) should arrive during Period 3 (visible at P4 START) and the P2 order (163 units) should arrive during Period 4 (visible at P5 START). Total in-transit is 327, which correctly matches P1+P2 orders. At the end of P2, we had 0 inventory and missed 165 demand in P2 and 144 in P1. Since we have 7 samples with no clear regime shift yet, I will use recent_N=7 for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the full recent history including the late-series increase. For lead time, I'll use 'default' as there's no evidence yet of a deviation from the promised 2 periods (P1 order is expected this period).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/4. The SKU is a 'V-neck satin top', which is a spring/summer garment. The demand history shows a steady increase from early February (144, 165, 184), indicating a seasonal upward trend as spring approaches. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (164), Period 2 (163), and Period 3 (151). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is strictly greater than 2, or the shipment is delayed. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the pipeline (478 units) has not yet reached the warehouse, I will maintain the 'default' lead time for now but set demand 'mu_hat' using 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture the accelerating upward trend (mean of ~164 per week) across the (L+1) window. I will also use 'recent_N' for 'sigma_hat' to better reflect the recent volatility (standard deviation of ~20) rather than the flatter initial samples.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is > 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed 2019/2/11) not arrived by start of Period 4. Demand shows seasonal upward trend reaching 184/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3097.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). Analysis of 'conclude' messages reveals a critical lead-time anomaly: The Period 2 order (163 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), but the Period 1 order (164 units) has NOT arrived as of the end of Period 4. If lead_time were 2, it should have arrived in Period 3; even if lead_time were 3, it should have arrived in Period 4. This implies the Period 1 order is likely lost or severely delayed. Current on-hand is 0 because demand (188) exceeded the Period 2 arrival (163). Demand is trending upwards: 144, 165, 184, 188 (last 4 periods mean ~170). The product is a 'V-neck satin top', which typically sees rising demand in spring. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture the upward trend (approx 170 * 3 = 510) and use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the supply chain instability and the missing P1 shipment. This will force the OR engine to target a higher base stock to cover the pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lost shipment confirmed for Period 1 order (164 units missing after 4 periods). Lead time reliability is low; adjusting planning horizon to 3 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's satin vest top, which typically sees rising demand as spring progresses. Analysis of arrivals: The order from P2 arrived in P4 (L=2). However, the order from P1 (164 units) has still not arrived by P6 (4 periods late), and the order from P3 (151 units) was promised to arrive in P5 but did not. Given that P2 arrived on time, but P1 and P3 are missing, we face significant supply instability. Demand is currently averaging ~170-180 (P3: 184, P4: 188, P5: 170). On-hand is 0, and we have 592 units in transit (which includes the likely lost P1 and potentially delayed/lost P3). To protect against lost shipments and satisfy rising seasonal demand, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly extending the horizon) and mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the higher late-Feb/mid-March demand levels (avg ~180/week). Sigma_hat is calculated on same window to account for the standard deviation in this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1 order (164 units) is 5 periods overdue and considered lost. P3 order (151 units) is 1 period overdue. Demand has shifted from a mean of ~140 in Jan/Feb to ~180 in Mar (+28%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing lead times: P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2), P5 order arrived in P6 (L=1). Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are currently missing/late. Specifically, P1 (placed 6 periods ago) and P3 (placed 4 periods ago) are significantly overdue, suggesting they are likely lost. The P4 order is 3 periods late (promised L=2). Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time is volatile (varying between 1, 2, and lost), I will set L to 3 to create a larger buffer for the OR engine, as we are consistently stocking out. Demand has shifted: January/February mean was ~143, while March (Periods 4-6) averages ~187, a 30% increase likely due to spring seasonality for a 'V-neck satin top'. I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime. Sigma_hat will also use the last 3 samples to account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: March demand increased to ~187/week (+30% vs Jan/Feb). Lead time reliability is extremely low with multiple missing/late shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (v-neck satin top) is entering April, showing a sharp upward demand trend (P7 demand jumped to 257). The last 3 weeks averaged ~210 units/week, a +50% increase from Jan/Feb levels (~140). Inventory management is severely hampered by unreliable logistics: P1, P3, and P4 orders (totaling approx 388 units) are significantly delayed or lost. However, P5 arrived in just 1 period. To mitigate extreme stockout risk while accounting for high lead-time variance, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine looks far enough ahead. I am using mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent spring demand surge (~210/week * (1+3) = 840) and 'recent_N' for sigma to handle the increased volatility seen in March.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed into April: Avg demand increased from ~180 in early March to ~210 in late March (+16% shift). Logistic instability remains high with at least 3 orders (P1, P3, P4) confirmed lost or severely delayed beyond 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7182.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'V-neck satin top' is experiencing a significant demand surge throughout March and into early April, with recent demand reaching 394 units (though heavily \u0645\u062a\u0627\u062b\u0631 by stockouts and backlogs). The current demand regime over the last 3 periods averages ~284 units/week, up from ~140 in Jan/Feb. Logistics are highly unstable: orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost (missing for 8, 6, and 5 periods respectively), while more recent orders (P5, P6, P7) have arrived with 1-2 period lead times. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 608 units in transit (P8 order). To account for the higher demand regime and the risk of lost shipments, I am setting L=3 to expand the protection horizon. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand spring trend (~284 units/week) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility as demand scales.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Average demand over the last 3 periods increased to 284 units/week (+100% vs Jan/Feb baseline). Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are definitively lost and removed from lead-time calculations.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the demand for the satin vest top continues to exhibit high volatility and a general upward trend linked to the spring season. Last period's demand was 206, following a spike of 394 in Period 8; the recent 4-period mean is approximately 265 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost (missing for 6+ periods). However, recent arrivals (P2 arrived in 2, P5 in 1, P6 in 2, P7 in 1) suggest that when shipments are not lost, the actual lead time is between 1-2 periods. I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time) to ensure the OR logic covers sufficient demand, as the average of successful deliveries is around 1.5. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 4-period average (265) is significantly higher than the overall average (~200). Using the recent 4 samples captures this shifted regime best. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high variance (394 vs 206) and prevent stockouts during this seasonal peak while dealing with the high risk of lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Service level risk remains high: 3 out of 9 placed orders (33%) have been lost. Demand avg is ~265 in April context.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the 'Leona' v-neck satin top is entering late April. Historical demand has shifted significantly: Jan/Feb averaged ~140, March averaged ~187, and April's average demand over the last 3 weeks is approximately 231 (257, 206, 233). There is a clear seasonal climb as we approach warmer weather. Logistics have been volatile; while three orders (P1, P3, P4) were lost, the most recent four arrivals (from P5, P6, P7, P8, P9) have shown lead times of 1 or 2 periods, suggesting a recovery in reliability but with faster turnarounds than the 'promised' 2 periods (avg. observed lead time of 1.4 for the last 5 successful arrivals). On-hand inventory is currently high (422) following the delivery of orders from P8 and P9. However, in-transit inventory (388 units from P10 and whatever was pending) needs to be considered against the sustained higher demand regime (~230/week). I will use N=4 for demand to capture the recent April levels and set L explicitly to 2 to provide a safety buffer for the base-stock calculation given previous loss history.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime stabilized at approximately 230 units/week (+64% vs Jan/Feb). Logistics reliability recovered with last 5 successful arrivals showing an actual lead time average of 1.4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th, heading into early May. Historical data shows demand for this satin vest top surged in late March/early April (avg ~280) but has since stabilized around 230-260 units per week. The last four periods (Periods 8-11) show demands of 394 (outlier), 206, 233, and 306, averaging ~284, but excluding the outlier gives a clearer mean near 248. Logistics have stabilized with recent arrivals showing lead times of 1-2 periods (avg 1.4). Currently, we have 116 units on hand and 880 units in pipeline (634 units in-transit + 246 units ordered in P11). Note: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are considered lost. To ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) = 3 period horizon while accounting for the recent demand regime, I will use a recent demand window and the promised lead time of 2 periods, as the backend's calculation of lead time might still be skewed by the lost orders.

Carry-over insight: May demand transition: Demand appears to be stabilizing post-Easter/April surge, but remains significantly higher (~250 units/week) than the Jan/Feb baseline of 140 (+78%).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (May transition), demand remains elevated at 225 units, showing a slight decrease from the April peak but still significantly above the Jan/Feb baseline. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 979 units in-transit (orders from Period 11, 12, plus older potentially lost units P1, P3, P4). Based on history, orders P1 (164), P3 (151), and P4 (73) have not arrived after 11, 9, and 8 periods respectively, confirming they are lost. Removing these 388 units from the pipeline yields 591 effective in-transit units. Demand analysis: Last 3 periods (P10-P12) demand mean is ~255 units. Given the transition into May for a 'V-neck satin top', demand is expected to remain consistent with spring/summer levels. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the shift post-April peak while maintaining high service levels (profit $19 vs holding $1). Lead time shows recent stability at 1.4 periods (averaging last 5 successful arrivals), so I will use 'calculate' to reflect this improved reliability.

Carry-over insight: May demand baseline established: Current demand (~250/week) remains +78% vs Jan/Feb baseline despite the passing of the Easter peak.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's Blouse/Satin Top) is transitioning into mid-May. After a significant demand peak in late March/April (reaching ~300+ units), recent data suggests stabilization near a higher baseline than Q1. Period 13 saw a sharp drop in demand (60 units), likely a post-peak correction or data variability, but current on-hand inventory is 186. In-transit inventory is high (733 units), consisting of orders from Period 12 (345 units) and others currently in the pipeline. With a promised lead time of 2 and an actual lead time average of approximately 1.5\u20132 periods (based on recent successful arrivals in Periods 10 and 13), I will set L to 2 to reflect the promised lead time and maintain safety stock. For demand (mu_hat), despite the anomalous low in Period 13, the average over the last 5 periods (excluding the outlier) is approximately 226/week. Given the seasonal nature of a 'V-neck satin top' entering late spring/summer, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized post-peak demand regime while damping the noise from Period 13. Sigma_hat is set to default to cover the observed volatility in this regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/20. We are observing a significant demand drop in May: Period 13 and 14 demand plummeted to 60 and 69 units respectively, compared to the April average of ~250. This likely marks the end of the spring peak for this vest top. On-hand inventory is healthy at 462 units with another 388 in-transit. Given the high profitability ($19) vs holding cost ($1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level, but we must lower the demand forecast (mu_hat) to avoid excessive overstocking now that demand has shifted downward. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this sudden drop (avg ~118/week). I will use explicit L=2 as the supply chain has stabilized to the promised lead time over the last 5 successful arrivals, and explicit sigma to account for the recent high volatility during the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13/14: Late May demand dropped significantly from ~250 to ~65 units/week (-74%), signaling the end of the seasonal peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a high Easter/April peak where demand averaged ~250 units/week, the last three periods (P13, P14, P15) have shown a sharp decline to 60, 69, and 48 units respectively (average ~59). This suggests the seasonal demand for this specific 'Womens Everyday Collection' vest top has cooled off as we enter late May. Currently, on-hand inventory is 414 units, which is approximately 7 weeks of supply at the new demand rate, and there are 388 units in-transit (P10 and P2 orders remain un-concluded, but P13/P14 arrivals show logistics are stable at 2 periods). Given the extreme overstock position relative to the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the low-demand environment. The inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 802) is far above any reasonable base stock level, so the OR backend will naturally suppress further ordering. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals have reverted to the promised 1-2 period range.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the satin v-neck top (category: Blouses/Vest top) has stabilized at a significantly lower 'post-peak' value since mid-May (Period 13/14). In the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand has been 60, 69, 48, and 48, averaging 56.25 units/week. This represents a 70%+ decrease from the April peak of ~230-280 units and even falls below the January/February baseline of ~140. Given the current date is early June (2019/6/3), we have entered a low-demand regime for this specific SKU. Current inventory position is high: on-hand is 366 and in-transit is 388 (total 754), while expected demand over the lead time (L=2) plus review period is only ~170 units. This creates a massive inventory surplus that will result in unnecessary holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect this new low-demand regime. This will prevent the OR backend from placing more orders and allow the existing inventory to be consumed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13/14: Post-peak demand stabilized at ~56 units/week (reduction of ~75% from April peak). Inventory levels are currently in surplus relative to this new demand baseline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Historical data and recent carry-over insights indicate a significant demand regime shift that occurred around mid-May (Period 13/14). Demand for this 'V-neck satin top' (a seasonal item likely peaking in spring) dropped from a high of ~250 units/week during the April/Easter surge to a post-peak average of approximately 52 units over the last five periods (60, 69, 48, 48, 33). This is a reduction of ~80% from the peak. On-hand inventory is currently very high (333 units) relative to this new demand baseline, and there are still 388 units in-transit (orders from previous high-demand periods that were not canceled). This creates a substantial surplus. With a holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $19.0, we must avoid further increasing inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low-demand post-peak regime (~52 units/week). L remains at the default/promised 2. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the reduced volatility in this lower demand state. Given on-hand + in-transit (721) is far higher than the expected base stock (approx 150-180), the OR backend will correctly logic to order 0 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) has undergone a significant regime shift. After peaking in April/early May (~250-300 units/week), demand plummeted starting Period 13 and has stabilized at a much lower baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), demand has averaged 45.8 units/week (69, 48, 48, 33, 31), following a downward trend as summer progresses. Current on-hand inventory is 302 units, which covers over 6 periods of demand at the current rate. With an additional 388 units in-transit (orders from earlier high-demand periods that are likely arriving delayed), we are in a massive surplus relative to the new demand regime. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the post-peak stabilization) to reflect this lower demand. Given the high stock levels (on-hand + pipeline >> demand * (L+1)), the OR engine will likely result in an order of 0, which is optimal to minimize further holding costs.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (V-neck satin top) has exited its seasonal peak phase (late March to early May). Since Period 13/14, demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level, averaging approximately 43 units per week over the last 5 periods (P15-P19). The current on-hand inventory of 266 units is more than sufficient to cover this low-demand regime for several months, with a coverage ratio of over 6 weeks at current consumption rates. Additionally, there are 388 units in-transit (likely from larger orders placed during the peak that were delayed or are simply flushing through the system). Given this massive inventory surplus (654 total units vs. a demand of ~43/week), the objective is to prevent any further ordering and minimize holding costs. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) captures the low-demand post-peak regime effectively, ensuring the base stock level calculated by the OR engine remains far below current inventory levels, resulting in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (late June context) is firmly established at ~43 units/week, down ~83% from the April peak of ~250 units/week.

The demand for SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) has clearly transitioned from a peak season (April/May) to a much lower baseline. Following the major demand regime shift observed around Period 13/14, demand has stabilized between 30-70 units per week. The last 3 periods showed demand of 31, 36, and 72. Current on-hand inventory (194) plus in-transit (388) results in a pipeline of 582 units. Given the new average demand (~46/week), this provides over 12 weeks of coverage. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7, covering periods 14-20) to capture the current stable low-demand window. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have normalized to 1-2 periods. The large existing inventory will naturally prevent new orders until the surplus is cleared, reducing holding costs.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (Women's Vest Top) is in a post-peak seasonal phase. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 13/14 (May), dropping from a peak of ~250 units/week to a sustained low-volume regime. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has averaged 48.8 units/week ((33+31+36+72+72)/5), though the last two weeks showed a slight uptick to 72. Current on-hand inventory (122) plus in-transit units (388) totals 510, which at current demand levels covers over 10 weeks of supply. The OR backend needs to recognize this low-demand regime to avoid further overstocking while we burn through existing inventory. I am setting L to the actual observed average (approx 1.6 periods) and using the last 5 periods (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the current stable low-demand state.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '618800001' (v-neck satin top) has transitioned into a post-peak summer regime. Demand peaked in April/early May and has since stabilized at a much lower level. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), demand has averaged 50.9 units/week, strictly following the 'Post-peak demand regime' identified in the CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS. Current on-hand inventory (82) plus the significant in-transit pipeline (388) is extremely high relative to current demand needs (approx. 9.2 weeks of supply on hand, much more in transit). The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy. Given the massive surplus (Inventory Position = 470 vs weekly demand ~50), the system will likely not place new orders even with default parameters. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this low-demand state (P13-P22) accurately, ensuring the OR engine recognizes the lower mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the lower volatility of this quiet period. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals have been stable around the 2-period promised mark.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) has stabilized in a 'post-peak' regime since Period 13/14 (late May). From Period 17 through Period 23, the average weekly demand has been approximately 46 units. The current on-hand inventory is 51 units, which covers more than one period of current demand. However, the system shows 388 units in-transit, which are almost certainly the 'lost' orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 164+151+73=388 units). These lost shipments distort the OR backend's budget-clearing logic. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current low-demand regime (mu_hat approx 138 for 3 periods), ensuring the OR engine correctly calculates that existing stock and pipeline (even if the pipeline is phantom) sufficiently cover current needs without placing unnecessary new orders while holding costs would accrue. Lead time calculation is set to 'calculate' as arrival reliability has stabilized since the initial chaos.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 20-24) has been consistent with the post-peak summer regime, averaging 55.8 units/week. As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), on-hand inventory is depleted (0 units), and there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 388 units. This pipeline is significant relative to current demand (~7 weeks of coverage), suggesting that previous parameters over-ordered or that shipments previously thought lost might be arriving. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the average historical arrival time (Promised L=2). For demand parameters, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized summer demand (approx 56/week), while the 388 units in-transit will likely prevent the OR engine from placing new orders this period, allowing the surplus to be worked through.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Leona V-neck satin vest top, which experienced high seasonal demand during the spring (Feb-May) and has since stabilized into a low-volume summer period. Specifically, the demand regime shifted at Period 13/14, dropping from ~250 units/week to a current average of approx 48 units/week (calculated over Periods 15 through 25). The current date is Aug 5, 2019. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and there is a massive pipeline inventory of 388 units (orders from P1-P4 were written off previously but are still counted in 'In-transit', though significantly, there's no record of those units arriving in history). However, historical data shows we place zero orders for the last 13 consecutive periods. We need to allow the current demand (avg ~48/week) to be met without triggering massive over-ordering if logic thinks the pipeline is empty. Given the OR backend formula, if I set L=2 and mu_hat for the last 10 periods, the base stock will be significantly lower than the 388 in-transit. No orders will be generated, which is correct because we actually don't want to buy more while demand is this low and there are potentially old shipments that might still show up or we are simply waiting for the season to end. Using recent_N=10 for mu and sigma to capture this stable low-demand tail (approx 48 mean).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Leona V-neck satin vest top, which experienced a significant seasonal peak in demand during March and April (reaching over 250 units/week), likely tied to Spring/Easter. Since Period 13 (early May), demand has plummeted and stabilized at a much lower regime. Analyzing the last 10 periods (Periods 17-26), the mean demand is 42.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 388 units 'In-transit'. However, looking closely at the history, no orders have been placed since Period 12. The 388 units in-transit consist of the long-lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (164 + 151 + 73 = 388). These are effectively lost shipments that never arrived and will likely never arrive. Because these 'ghost' units occupy the pipeline inventory in the OR backend's logic, the system will not place new orders despite zero on-hand inventory. To trigger an order to meet the current low-level stable demand (~43 units/week), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this stagnant pipeline of 388 units. I will set mu_hat to 600 (approx. (1+L)*200) to force an order that compensates for the lost units and establishes a base stock for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 388 'ghost' units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4). Demand regime since P17 is stable at ~43 units/week. Parameters must be adjusted to ignore the stagnant pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 19, 2019. The product is a v-neck satin top, which is past its seasonal peak (April/May). On-hand inventory is 0, and current demand is low, averaging approximately 43 units/week since Period 17 (July/August). The 'In-transit' count of 617 units is significantly distorted by 388 units from lost orders (Period 1: 164; Period 3: 151; Period 4: 73) which will never arrive. The only valid in-transit shipment is the 229 units ordered in Period 27. To correct the logic for the OR backend, which subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and our actual pipeline is 229 but the system sees 617, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired base stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at ~43 units/week is ~129. To offset the 388 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 129 + 388 = 517. This forces the engine to recognize we need inventory despite the fake pipeline. I use explicit sigma_hat set to 20 to maintain a tight service level for this low-demand phase without over-ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Leona V-neck satin top' has settled into a low-volume post-peak regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 48 units per week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 617 units includes 388 'ghost' units from lost orders (Periods 1, 3, and 4) which will never arrive, a 229-unit order from Period 27 (due now, but not reflected in the conclude yet), and potentially other logic noise. To handle the ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or ensure the OR backend's cap doesn't block necessary replenishment. However, a 229-unit order from P27 is currently in the pipeline (promised LT=2). Given the demand is ~48/week, that order alone covers nearly 5 weeks of demand. We are entering late August/September, where trans-seasonal demand for this item is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease. I will use recent_N=12 to capture the stable post-peak demand regime (averaging ~49 units). Lead time remains at the default promised value of 2 as recent successful deliveries (P13, P14) adhered to it.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 (V-neck satin top) is currently in a stable post-peak demand regime. Since Period 22, demand has averaged approximately 51 units/week (samples: 40, 31, 64, 43, 30, 48, 69, 63). Current Date: Sep 2, 2019. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 617 units is significantly inflated by historical lost orders (P1: 164, P3: 151, P4: 73 - total 388 'ghost' units). The only valid active order is from P27 (229 units), which should have arrived in P29 given a lead time of 2. Its absence in the P29 conclude message suggests it will likely arrive during P30 (appearing in P31's report). To account for the 388 ghost units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the expected (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the ghost inventory volume. This forces the OR backend to place an order despite the perceived high pipeline. Calculation: (1+2) * 51 + 388 = 541.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13/14 remains stable at a significantly lower level compared to the spring peak. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P21-P30) is approximately 54.4 units/week. The last order placed in Period 27 arrived in Period 30 with a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that recent shipments are arriving, although slightly slower than the promised 2 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 388 units consists of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are definitively lost and will never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting L=3 to match current reality and using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using the recent 10-period average for demand (~55) and providing a conservative sigma to ensure service levels without overstocking. Current on-hand (157) covers approximately 3 periods of demand, so the OR engine will likely place a small or no order this period to maintain the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for successful recent delivery (P27) was 3 periods. Pipeline still contains 388 lost units from P1, P3, P4 which should be ignored.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Demand has stabilized in a post-peak regime since Period 17, with recent weekly demand (Periods 27-31) averaging approximately 61 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 388 represents confirmed lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4; since the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base_stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to override this and ensure a new order is triggered when needed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 102 units, which covers about 1.6 periods of demand. Given an observed lead time of 3 periods (from Period 30 arrival), we need to ensure local stock plus real arrivals covers lead time + 1. Since the pipeline is full of 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (~61 units/week) and use L=3 to reflect the most recent actual lead time. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 388 units in the pipeline and refusing to order, I set mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment once on-hand drops further, or rely on the logic that the current on-hand (102) is sufficient for this immediate period while monitoring lead time.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/09/23 (Period 33). The product is a satin vest top, which experienced a significant seasonal peak in April/May (~250 units/week) and has since stabilized into a much lower post-peak demand regime. For the last 15 periods (since Period 17), the average demand has been approximately 51 units/week. Most recently (Periods 30-32), demand was 72, 55, and 29. The in-transit inventory of 388 units consists entirely of 'ghost' units from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4; these will never arrive and must be bypassed to allow the OR engine to place new orders. With on-hand inventory at 73 units and a lead time of roughly 2-3 periods, the current stock is sufficient for about 1.4 weeks of demand. To ensure we don't stock out given the lead time, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at the current regime mean of ~51. Since the 'ghost' pipeline is much larger than any reasonable base stock for this demand levels, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will effectively result in zero orders until the ghost units are accounted for or on-hand is exhausted. However, by setting explicit values matched to the current low-demand regime, I minimize holding cost risk for this end-of-season period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34 (Sep 30), the on-hand inventory has depleted to 3 units following steady demand. The pipeline inventory of 388 units consists entirely of lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (confirmed in carry-over insights), which the OR engine would incorrectly include in its calculations. To force an order and bypass this 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting L to 0 and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The demand regime from Period 17 onwards is stable with an average of approximately 50 units/week. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, I need to cover demand for current period (P34), P35, and P36 (total 3 periods). Using a mean of 50, the required base stock is roughly 150 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order of approximately 150 units while it thinks there are 388 units in transit, I set mu_hat to 540 (calculated as Target Order 150 + Ghost Pipeline 388 + Safety Buffer). This will force the system to reconcile the ghost inventory and bring the physical on-hand stock back to levels sufficient for the current low-demand regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7th, 2019. Demand has been stable since Period 17 (early June), averaging approximately 48 units per week (min 25, max 72). However, we have a significant pipeline issue: the 'In-transit' quantity of 564 units includes 388 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are clearly lost (over 30 periods overdue). The OR engine ignores these losses and subtracts the full 564 from its order calculation, which would prevent any new orders from being placed. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 48 units/week. For a lead time of 2, the required level is (1+L)*mu = 3 * 48 = 144 units. To bypass the ghost pipeline of 388 units, I must set mu_hat to approximately 144 + 388 = 532. I will set mu_hat to 540 and sigma_hat to 50 to maintain a safety buffer and trigger an order since on-hand is 0 and the actual 'real' pipeline (P34 order) is only 176 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'V-neck satin top with lace trim', a seasonal fashion item. Demand has settled into a post-peak baseline of ~46 units/week (average of the last 15 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 623 contains 388 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost (ghost units), leaving a real pipeline of 235 units (Period 34: 176, Period 35: 59). In the last successful arrival (Period 30), the lead time was 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to account for this recent observation. Based on the 15-period post-peak stability, I will set mu_hat using the last 15 samples (average ~46) and sigma_hat using the same window. The OR backend will see (1+3)*46 = 184 as the base demand, and since the real pipeline (235) exceeds this, the capped policy will prevent over-ordering while waiting for the P34 and P35 batches to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (since P20) remains stable at ~46 units/week. Real pipeline inventory (total in-transit minus 388 lost units) is 235 as of Period 36.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing a 'V-neck satin top', entering the late October period. Demand has consistently softened from the mid-year peak, averaging roughly 46 units/week over the last 15 periods (since Period 20), and even lower (~35/week) in the last five. However, we must account for the arrival of the Period 34 order (176 units) which is currently overdue (standard LT 2, current elapsed 3), but confirmed by the arrive = 59 message from Period 35 that the supply chain is functioning. Current pipeline inventory is 564 units, but including P1, P3, and P4 lost orders (164+151+73 = 388 units), the 'real' pipeline is 176 (from P34). Total real inventory position is On-hand (46) + Real Pipeline (176) = 222 units. At a demand of ~40-45 units/week, this covers roughly 5 weeks. Since demand is currently very low (13 and 19 in recent weeks), we risk high holding costs if we order more. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (last 16 weeks) to maintain a lean stock level while acknowledging the 388 ghost units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at a lower baseline of ~45 units/week since Period 20. Seasonal transition to autumn/winter for 'Vest tops' suggests no immediate demand spike.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'V-neck satin top' (SKU 618800001) is currently in a stable, low-demand regime characteristic of the autumn/winter season. Since Period 33, demand has further softened, averaging approximately 20 units/week (last 5 samples: 25, 19, 13, 21, 15). The 'In-transit' total of 564 includes 388 units from 'ghost' orders (P1, P3, P4) that are non-delivered. Subtracting these, the real pipeline is 176 units (the order from P34). Given the promised lead time is 2 periods and we have observed actual lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods recently (P35 arrived in 1 period; P27 arrived in 3 periods), I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent downward drift in the stable regime. This ensures we don't over-order against the 388 phantom units while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current 20/week demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand regime has been stable since Period 20, averaging ~45 units/week. Calendar context (November) for a 'Vest top' (women's everyday collection) typically suggests low seasonality compared to the spring peak observed in April. The pipeline inventory is reported as 564 units, but this includes 388 'ghost' units from historically lost orders (P1, P3, P4) that never arrived. The effective pipeline is 176 units (the order from P34), which is currently overdue (placed 5 periods ago with a promised lead time of 2). Because the OR engine uses the full 'in-transit' figure, it will believe we are overstocked (564 units vs a needs of ~(1+2)*45 = 135) and will not order. To force an order to replenish the 0 on-hand inventory and cover near-term demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the cycle demand (L+1) as 3 periods * 45 units/week = 135 units. To trigger the OR engine to order despite the 564 unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed that pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approx 564 + one week's demand) ensures the backend generates a replenishment order to mitigate the stockout while accounting for the 'ghost' inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are in a late Autumn/Winter context for a summer-seasonal product ('Vest top'). Demand has been stable at a low baseline (approx. 45 units/week) since Period 20. The pipeline inventory (715 units) is heavily distorted by 388 'ghost' units from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (164+0+151+73=388 units based on history analysis, though the logic shows P1, P3, P4 didn't arrive). The remaining legitimate in-transit units (327) come from P34 (176) and P39 (151). P34 is now 6 periods overdue, which is suspicious given the promised lead time of 2. I will set mu_hat to match the current demand regime of ~45/week (135 for review + lead time). To prevent the OR backend from failing to order due to the large 'ghost' pipeline, I maintain an 'explicit' L of 3 to reflect recent actual delivery times and a sigma_hat that accounts for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Order from Period 34 (176 units) is 6 periods overdue and likely lost; ghost pipeline now totals 564 units (P1, P3, P4, P34). Current demand baseline remains ~45 units/week in the winter season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 618800001 is a 'Vest top', which currently faces low seasonal demand (~43 units/week) compared to its spring peak. In Period 41, the system shows On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 715 units. Historical analysis reveals that 564 of these units are 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (Period 1: 164, Period 3: 151, Period 4: 73, Period 34: 176). The real active pipeline consists only of the Period 39 order (151 units). Subtracting the 564 lost units from the 715 total in-transit confirms 151 units are genuinely expected. Given the current demand baseline of ~45 units/week, the 151 units in-transit (covering 3+ weeks of demand) are sufficient. I am maintaining the mu_hat at approximately the (1+L) * 45 level. The OR backend will see the full 715 'In-transit' and likely order 0, which is correct as the real 151 units are coming and we want to avoid overstocking a low-demand item.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the winter season (late November), maintaining a stable demand baseline of approximately 45 units per week since Period 20. The current on-hand inventory is 78 units. The in-transit pipeline of 564 units is technically composed entirely of 'ghost' inventory from lost orders: Period 1 (164), Period 3 (151), Period 4 (73), and Period 34 (176), totaling 564. These orders are significantly past any reasonable delivery window and will not arrive. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost pipeline and refusing to order, I must set the lead time (L) and demand parameters (mu_hat) to assume no incoming stock is available. The actual lead time for recent successful deliveries (P35, P39) has been 1-2 periods, so I will use an explicit L of 2. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the stable demand regime since the post-peak drop (approx 45 units/week) to ensure the system targets a base stock level that covers future demand without over-ordering.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Vest top' (SKU 618800001) experienced a massive one-week spike in Period 42 (542 units), likely driven by a Black Friday event or early holiday promotion (Date: 2019/11/25). Historically, demand for this item is approximately 45 units/week during the winter regime (since Period 20). Given that on-hand inventory is now 0, the backend needs to trigger a restock. However, I must account for 'ghost' in-transit units. The total in-transit is 564, but this includes P1 (164), P3 (151), P4 (73), and P34 (176) which are definitely lost, totaling 564. Effectively, the real pipeline inventory is 0. To trigger an order despite the 'In-transit' figure, I will set mu_hat to a high explicit value to account for the recent spike while maintaining a base stock that covers realistic winter demand. Since the Black Friday surge is typically isolated, I used a conservative mean for the next few lead periods (L=2) plus safety stock. I set L=2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries (P36, P41) averaged 1.5-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday demand spike confirmed at Period 42 (542 units). Real pipeline inventory remains 0 as all 564 'In-transit' units are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P34).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant seasonal demand spike corresponding to Black Friday and the early December holiday shopping period. In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand spiked to 542 units, followed by a sustained high demand of 297 units in Period 43 (Dec 2). This marks a clear demand regime shift from the previous baseline of ~45 units/week. As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are at 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts during this surge. The 'In-transit' total of 957 units contains 564 'ghost units' from definitively lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, and 34), meaning the actual pipeline inventory is 393 units (ordered in Period 43). I set L=2 (promised), as recent successful deliveries (P39 at 2 periods, P35 at 1 period) suggest stabilization of logistics, though I account for the lost P34. I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 750 (representing a 3-week forecast: (1+L) * 250 avg weekly demand) to maintain high service levels during this seasonal peak and replenish the 0 on-hand position, while accounting for the 393 real units in transit. Sigma_hat is set explicitly higher to 180 to handle the high volatility observed during the Black Friday peak.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Holiday demand surge confirmed: Demand spiked to 542 (P42) and remained high at 297 (P43), shifting the baseline from ~45 to ~250+ units for the December period. Real pipeline inventory is 393 units; total 'ghost units' in pipeline remain 564.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season where demand has shifted from a low baseline (~45) to a high seasonal regime (P42: 542, P43: 297, P44: 132). The average demand of the last three periods is approximately 323 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit reflects 1047 units, but 564 of these are 'ghost' units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P34), leaving a real pipeline of 483 units (P43 order: 393, P44 order: 90). The lead time remains unstable but generally averages around 2 periods. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand period while accounting for the significant 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine will otherwise over-count, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 969 to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the current average of ~323/week. This ensures the backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current surge and compensates for the misleadingly high pipeline figure.

Carry-over insight: Holiday regime demand (Dec 2019) is averaging ~323 units/week. Ghost units in pipeline increased to 564 after P34 order loss was confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7467.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 23, 2019 (Christmas week). Historical demand shows a significant holiday regime shift starting Period 42 with Black Friday (542) and continuing through mid-December (297, 132, 475). The last recorded demand (Period 45) was 475 units. This SKU is a 'V-neck satin top', which is seasonally relevant for holiday parties and gifting in December. The pipeline inventory is currently 1164, but 564 of these are confirmed 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P34), leaving a real pipeline of 600 units (90 from P44, 510 from P45). With 0 on-hand inventory and recent demand levels, we must maintain a high base stock. Since actual lead times have stabilized at approximately 2 periods for recent successful deliveries (P41, P43, P45), I will use L=2. For demand, I will use a recent N=4 to capture the high-demand December window (Avg: 361.5) while smoothing the dip in P44. This ensures our base stock targets (1+L) * mean demand, covering roughly 1085 units in the base stock calculation, which appropriately offsets the 600 real units in transit and prepares for potential end-of-year clearance or New Year sales.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec 2019) is highly volatile but averages ~361 units/week (Periods 42-45). Real lead time is 2 periods. Ghost units in pipeline remain constant at 564.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are at the end of the holiday peak. Demand in the last four periods (P43-P46) has been 297, 132, 475, and 271, averaging 294 units/week. This represents a high-demand regime compared to the autumn baseline. Logistics-wise, the pipeline is heavily congested with 1611 units reported. However, we must account for 'ghost units'. Confirmed lost orders include P1 (164), P3 (151), P4 (73), and P34 (176), totaling 564 units. Additionally, recent orders from P44 (90 units) and P45 (510 units) are within the normal lead time window (L=2) and should arrive soon. P46's order of 447 is also in transit. The 'real' pipeline is roughly 1611 - 564 = 1047 units. Given the transition from Dec to Jan, I expect a seasonal cool-down, but the OR engine needs to cover (L+1) periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the holiday average (294) to ensure the service level doesn't crash if demand remains elevated into early Jan, while relying on the massive 'real' pipeline to naturally transition the inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec 2019) averaged ~294 units/week over P43-P46. Real pipeline inventory (In-transit minus 564 ghost units) is 1047 units. Lead time is stable at 2 periods.
