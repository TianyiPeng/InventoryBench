Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is a Women's Lingerie item (cotton and lace briefs). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 112.6 units (99, 127, 104, 87, 146). The most recent observation (146) shows a significant spike, potentially related to the lead-up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14). Given the context of lingerie and the date, I anticipate a short-term demand peak. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we have enough stock to cover the review period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3), and accounting for the recent uptick, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full recent distribution while giving weight to the current trend. L is set to default (promised).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a 3-pack of cotton hipster briefs (Womens Lingerie). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (152 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods. In Period 1, we saw demand of 173, but sold 0 due to 0 on-hand inventory. Looking at the five historical demand samples (99, 127, 104, 87, 146), the average is 112.6. Period 1's demand (173) is significantly higher than the historical average, possibly indicating a post-Valentine's Day demand peek or a shift in regime. Given the stockout in Period 1 and high demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 (last two samples + Period 1) to capture the upward trend. I will use default for Lead Time (2) and sigma_hat.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of women's cotton and lace hipster briefs. Evaluation of internal history (Jan-Feb samples) shows a steady increase in demand: 99, 127, 104, 87, 146, 173 (Period 1), 199 (Period 2). The mean of the most recent 3 samples (146, 173, 199) is 172.6, indicating a significant upward trend compared to the earlier Jan average (~104). We are currently in Period 3 with 0 on-hand inventory due to the promised lead time of 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (152 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 (this period) and will be visible in the next conclude message. The order from Period 2 (189 units) is expected in Period 4. Total in-transit (341) matches sum(P1 order, P2 order). I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent demand surge for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For lead time, I will stick with the promised 'default' of 2 as there is no evidence yet of delivery failure or delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~173 (+73%) over the last 3 observed periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'Greta Ch hipster ctn 3p' is a women's lingerie item. Looking at the history, the demand in the first three periods (173, 199, 147) is significantly higher than the initial samples from January/early February (avg ~112). This confirms the demand regime shift noted in the Carry-over Insights (mean ~173). As for supply, the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (152 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates either a lead time drift (L=3+) or a lost shipment. Since it is only one period late, I will adjust L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for the delay and ensure the replenishment logic covers a longer window. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current high-demand regime (~173 per period).

Carry-over insight: Lead time drift detected: Period 1 order (152 units) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude as expected (promised L=2). Effective L appears to be at least 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1731.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019-03-11), we see the first shipment arrival. Interestingly, the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 ('lead_time was 2 periods'), while the Period 1 order (152 units) is still missing. This suggests a lost shipment or a significant lead-time disruption for earlier batches, while newer ones adhere to the promised L=2. The demand regime from 2019-02-11 to 2019-03-04 has averaged 153.75 units per period (173, 199, 147, 96), which is higher than the initial samples averaging 112.6. The recent drop to 96 suggests high variance or a tapering off after a Feb peak. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 temporarily to recover from the missing Period 1 units and the initial stockout, ensuring the inventory position covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (including pre-game samples) to capture the higher recent mean of ~137 ((146+173+199+147+96)/5) adjusted for the lead time (1+L=4).

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lost shipment confirmed. Period 1 order (152 units) failed to arrive by P4 conclude, while P2 order arrived on time (L=2). Demand remains volatile but higher than pre-game (P1-P4 mean: 154 vs pre-game: 113).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 5. Pipeline inventory is 642 units. Reviewing the history: The Period 1 order (152 units) is officially lost as it has significantly exceeded the promised lead time of 2 and subsequent orders have arrived. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2). The orders from Period 3 (217 units), Period 4 (216 units), and Period 5 (57 units) are in transit. Demand analysis: Pre-game mean was ~113. Periods 1-5 demand: 173, 199, 147, 96, 101. The mean of these 5 periods is 143.2. There was a notable spike in P1-P3 followed by a drop in P4-P5. Using recent_N (N=5) for demand better reflects this recent volatility and the shift away from the pre-game mean of 113. Since the P2 order arrived on time (L=2), I will revert the lead time parameter L to 'default' (2) to avoid over-ordering, while acknowledging the P1 loss in my pipeline total. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma to capture the high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 46) seen in the first 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: P1 order (152 units) confirmed lost; pipeline inventory requires manual reconciliation against active in-transit orders (P3, P4, P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the environment shows high demand volatility and shipment reliability issues. Product analysis: Basic women's lingerie (hipster briefs) typically has stable demand, but we are seeing spikes likely due to stockout backfill or promotional context. Critical Inventory Situation: On-hand is 0. The Period 1 order (152 units) is confirmed lost, as it is 4 periods overdue. The In-transit count of 585 units represents orders from Period 3 (217), Period 4 (216), and Period 6 (0). However, calculating current In-transit based on history: P3 (217) and P4 (216) are the only pending orders since P5 (57) already arrived in P6. This discrepancy (585 vs 433) suggests the OR backend still counts the lost P1 (152) order in pipeline inventory. To compensate for the 'phantom' 152 units and the stockout, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. Demand analysis: Last 6 periods mean = 134.7; Pre-game mean = 112.6. Recent demand (P4-P6) has stabilized lower (~96), but we must recover from stockouts. Lead time: Promised is 2; P5 arrived in 1; P2 arrived in 2; P1 lost. I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to average observed performance while keeping L=2 as the logic base. Mu_hat is set to (1+2)*140 = 420 to ensure aggressive replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 152 lost units from Period 1; explicit mu_hat adjustments needed to bypass OR backend logic until reconciled. Recent demand (P4-P6) mean has stabilized at 96 units, contrasting with P1-P3 mean of 173.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-04-01. The P1 order of 152 units is officially lost, creating a phantom 152 units in the 'In-transit' figure of 585 reported by the backend. The true pipeline consists of P3 (217 units) and P4 (216 units), totaling 433 valid units. Both should arrive soon as they were placed 4 and 5 periods ago respectively (lead time is volatile, averaging 1-2 periods when not lost). Demand has shifted: P1-P3 averaged 173 units, while P4-P7 averaged 100 units (96, 101, 92, 112). I will assume a stabilized demand regime of ~100 units/week. To correctly steer the OR backend (which uses 'pipeline' = on-hand + in-transit), I must account for the 152 lost units. If target base stock is (L+1)*mu, and the OR logic is (Target - InTransit), I must inflate 'mu_hat' so the OR logic results in the desired order. Target order should be small given 433 valid units are arriving. With L=2, mu=100, target base stock is 300. Reported pipeline is 585. Since 585 > 300, the OR backend will order 0 unless I use explicit values to bypass. Given the large backlog of valid orders (433 units) against a demand of 100/week, I will set order to 0 by using a conservative mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a lower regime: P4-P7 mean is 100 units/period (down from P1-P3 mean of 173). Total 'In-transit' includes 152 lost units from P1; net valid pipeline is 433 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '719655001' is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at history, demand has entered a stable regime after an initial spike; the mean of the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is approximately 103 units, which is lower than the early periods but slightly higher than the pre-game data. One critical issue remains: the order of 152 units from Period 1 is confirmed lost as it has and will not arrive, yet it remains in the backend 'In-transit' calculation (585 units total - 152 lost = 433 valid units). The valid pipeline consists of orders from P3 (217 units) and P4 (216 units). Both are overdue relative to the promised L=2, suggesting current logistics delays or that they might also be lost; however, I will assume a longer Lead Time (L=4) for calculation. To ensure the backend doesn't under-order due to the phantom 152 'in-transit' units, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * forecast. With L=4 and forecast=110, target = 550. Backend formula is Base Stock - Pipeline. Since 550 - 585 < 0, the OR backend would order 0. To trigger a corrective order to reach a net valid target of 550 units (ignoring the 152 lost), I need the backend to see a needed Base Stock of 550 + 152 = 702 units. I will set mu_hat to 700 to force a small top-up order while acknowledging the valid stock already in the pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 737 units in transit. The 'In-transit' total includes 152 lost units from Period 1 (confirmed by Period 6), meaning the valid pipeline is 585 units. Demand has shifted to a lower regime; the last 6 observed periods (P4-P9) show a mean of 94.8 units, compared to the initial high of 173. The most recent demand (P9) was significantly lower at 53. Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (total undelivered units), it believes we have 152 more units coming than actually exist. To prevent under-ordering, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these lost units. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2, (1+2)*95 = 285 units. To trick the OR backend (which subtracts 737 in-transit), I set mu_hat to a value that results in a base_stock of ~1022 (285 target + 737 fake pipeline + 152 lost units adjustment). This ensures the order placed covers future demand despite the phantom inventory in the system.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P4-P9 mean is 95 units/period. Valid pipeline confirmed as 585 units (Total 737 minus 152 units lost from Period 1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we have arrived at a stable demand regime following a period of high volatility. The mean demand for the last 7 periods (P4-P10) is 88.8 units, though the very recent demand observed in P9 and P10 has dropped further to 53 units/period. The pipeline inventory 'In-transit' is reported as 934 units; however, 152 units from Period 1 are confirmed lost, and several earlier orders (P3: 217 units, P4: 216 units) are significantly delayed and likely lost as they are now 7-8 periods past order date. This represents 585 units in the 'In-transit' balance that are ghost units. The OR backend uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide the order quantity. To prevent these phantom units from suppressing necessary orders, I will set 'L' to 2 (promised) and use 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand over (L+1)=3 periods at approximately 210 units (70/week). By setting mu_hat = 795 (estimated demand 210 + 585 ghost units), the backend will effectively ignore the lost 585 units when subtracting the 934 pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Phantom pipeline inventory total identified as 585 units (P1: 152, P3: 217, P4: 216) which remain in 'In-transit' but have not arrived after 7+ periods. Recent demand (P9-P10) shows a potential further softening to ~53 units/period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for SKU 719655001 shows 32 units on-hand and 934 units in-transit. Based on 'Carry-Over Insights', historical data confirms a significant 'phantom' pipeline problem: orders from P1 (152), P3 (217), and P4 (216) are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 585 units. This reduces the 'true' pipeline from 934 to 349 units (the order placed in P10). Demand has shifted downwards significantly: the mean of P9-P11 is ~58 units/period, compared to the P4-P8 mean of ~103 units/period and the initial surge of ~173. The lead time is also volatile, showing 1-2 periods for successful arrivals. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously stopping orders due to the 585 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for (L+1=3) periods based on the recent demand (58 * 3 = 174) and add the 585 lost units to 'offset' the backend subtraction of the total in-transit quantity. Target mu_hat = 174 + 585 = 759. This ensures that if (On-hand + True Pipeline) < 174, the backend will still place an order.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains at low regime: P9-P11 mean is 58 units. Total phantom inventory confirmed at 585 units (P1, P3, P4). Valid pipeline consists only of P10 order (349 units).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6). There is a significant inventory discrepancy. The 'In-transit' total is 934 units, but historically, orders from P1 (152), P3 (217), and P4 (216) are long overdue (7-11 periods vs promised 2), totaling 585 units that are effectively lost. The 'Valid' pipeline consists of the P10 order (349 units), which has not arrived yet (lead time 2+). Demand spiked in P12 (157), deviating from the recent mean of ~58. The rolling mean of the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 82.5. To manage the stockout and the 'phantom' pipeline inventory (585 units) which the OR engine incorrectly counts as available, I must set the mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (1 + L) * expected_demand. With L=2, (3 * 82.5) = 247.5. To force an order despite the 934 units in-transit (where the engine sees 934 but only 349 are coming), I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 934' results in a positive order. However, the OR backend also applies a cap (mu_hat / (1+L)). To ensure a replenishment order is triggered to cover the current stockout and expected demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand volatility increased (P12: 157). Validated 'In-transit' discrepancy: 585 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/phantom; only 349 units (P10) are valid in pipeline. Total In-transit (934) significantly overstates availability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face a major inventory visibility crisis. The system shows an 'In-transit' total of 1343 units. However, based on the historical 'conclude' messages, we have confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost/never-arriving shipments) totaling 585 units (P1: 152, P3: 217, P4: 216). Furthermore, the P10 order (349 units) placed on 2019/4/15 is now 4 periods old (promised L=2); if it were to arrive, it should have been visible in the P12 or P13 conclude messages. Its continued absence strongly suggests it is also lost or significantly delayed, adding 349 units to the phantom total. The only likely valid pipeline is the P13 order of 409 units. Valid pipeline = 1343 (In-transit) - 585 (P1, P3, P4) - 349 (P10) = 409 units. Due to the OR backend's inability to ignore lost shipments, these 934 phantom units will prevent the logic from ordering unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the phantom pipeline. Demand is currently in a lower regime; the mean of the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 77.4 units. To force an order that covers the next 3 weeks (L+1) while bypassing the 934 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (Demand * 3) + Phantom Pipeline = (77 * 3) + 934 = 1165. Sigma is set based on recent volatility (std of last 5 periods \u2248 45, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 934 units as P10 order (349 units) failed to arrive by P13 conclude (4 periods elapsed, promised L=2). Valid pipeline is only the P13 order (409 units). Recent demand (P9-P13) mean is 77.4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: Current on-hand is 0. Demand for the product (cotton hipster briefs) is in a lower regime compared to early periods, with the most recent 6 periods (P9-P14) averaging 74.3 units. There is a massive discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory: 1343 units are reported, but history analysis confirms that orders from P1 (152), P3 (217), P4 (216), and now P10 (349) have likely been lost or are significantly delayed (lead times > 4 periods for P10, and > 10 periods for the others). Total phantom inventory is 934 units (152+217+216+349). The only potentially valid in-transit order is from P13 (409 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' value (1343) from its calculated base_stock, it will fail to place necessary orders. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to compensate for the 934 units of lost inventory. Target base_stock (L=2) should cover 3 periods of demand (~223 units). To bypass the pipeline deduction, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target base_stock plus the phantom volume: 223 + 934 \u2248 1157 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 934 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Recent demand (P9-P14) mean is 74.3. Only the P13 order (409 units) remains potentially valid.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1343 units in-transit. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, 934 units (from P1: 152, P3: 217, P4: 216, P10: 349) are far beyond their promised lead time (2) and are likely lost or phantom inventory. The only valid pipeline shipment is the 409 units ordered in P13, which is now at L=3 (one period late). Since the OR Backend subtracts the total In-Transit (1343) from the calculated base_stock, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 934 phantom units. Recent demand (P9-P15) averages 75 units/period. To ensure an order is placed and we bridge the gap created by phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory Position (Base Stock) should cover L+1 periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. Forecasted demand for 3 periods (L+1) = ~225. Adding the 934 phantom units yields 1159. However, any amount over 1343 will trigger an order. I am setting mu_hat to 1420 to ensure a safety buffer of ~77 units and accounting for the phantom stockpile to force a procurement cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Phantom pipeline inventory remains 1343 units. P13 order (409 units) is now at L=3 and has not arrived. Demand mean for last 7 periods (P9-P15) is 75.0 units/period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU 719655001 is facing a severe supply chain failure. The current 'In-transit' stock of 1527 units is almost entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory (lost or severely delayed shipments). Specifically, orders from P1 (152), P3 (217), P4 (216), P10 (349), and P13 (409) have all exceeded their promised lead time (L=2) and subsequent Grace periods without arriving. The only potentially viable order is from P16 (184 units). Summing the phantom units: 152+217+216+349+409 = 1343 units. The OR backend uses the formula 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend sees 1527 units in-transit, it will not place any new orders unless base_stock exceeds 1527. To overcome this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the phantom inventory. Recent demand (P9-P16) averages 77 units per period. For a (L+1) horizon of 3 periods, expected demand is ~231. To trigger an order that covers this demand despite the 1343 phantom units, I set mu_hat = 231 + 1343 = 1574. This forces the backend to recognize the need for new stock. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variance/latency, and sigma_hat 'recent_N' (N=8) captures the recent demand volatility (range 53 to 157).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 1343 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Valid pipeline contains only P16 order (184 units). Explicit mu_hat adjustment (demand + phantom_sum) is required each period to trigger ordering until phantom units are reconciled.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked to 178 units, significantly higher than the previous 7-period average of ~75. This may indicate a temporary surge or the start of a higher demand regime. Crucially, the P16 order (184 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, providing confirmation of recent delivery success despite a massive volume of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Total In-transit is 1490 units, but 1343 of these are confirmed phantom (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). The valid pipeline contains only the P17 order of 147 units. To force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 1490 In-transit) to place an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1.5 * Anticipated Demand * (1 + L)) + phantom_buffer. Given the volatility and the 178 demand observation, I will forecast a mu_hat based on 100 units/period demand * 3 periods (L+1) plus the 1343 phantom units to bypass the backend subtraction. 300 + 1343 = 1643. This should trigger an order roughly equivalent to 2 periods of anticipated demand while accounting for the current On-hand of 6 and valid In-transit of 147.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand spiked to 178 in P17 (previous mean ~75). Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at 1343 units. Delivery resumed with P16 arriving in 1 period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we face a significant issue with 'In-transit' inventory tracking. The system reports 1779 units in-transit, but based on history, a cumulative total of 1343 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13) are 'phantom' or lost, as they have not arrived despite the promised L=2 and recent deliveries (like P16) arriving in 1 period. Actual valid pipeline inventory consists only of the orders from P17 (147 units) and P18 (289 units), totaling 436 units. Demand has spiked recently (P17: 178, P18: 153), likely due to June seasonality for women's lingerie (summer/vacation). To bypass the OR backend's logic, which subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that includes both the forecasted demand and the phantom inventory. I estimate demand for the 3-period window (L+1) at approximately 480 units (160/period). Adding the 1343 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1823. I set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of the recent season.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Seasonal demand spike confirmed (June); mean demand increased to ~165. Phantom inventory remains at 1343 units; explicit base stock adjustments must account for this to ensure orders are placed.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24. A sustained high-demand regime is confirmed for June (P17-P19 mean ~168 units), significantly higher than the April-May average (~75 units). We have a critical 'phantom' inventory issue: Total In-transit is 1661 units, but history confirms that 1343 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 13 are lost/phantom. The valid pipeline consists of the P19 order (171 units) and the P17 order (147 units, which should have arrived in P18/P19 based on the recent 1-period L, but is currently unaccounted for; it's safer to treat it as late or lost). To force an order despite the 1661 units in-transit, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L)*Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=2 (promised) and demand=168, Target Base Stock = (3 * 168) + 1343 = 1847. I use explicit mu_hat = 1847 and sigma_hat based on the recent high-volatility window (N=3) to ensure a high service level for this summer peak period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. Demand has consistently increased through June, confirming a seasonal peak (P17-P20 mean is 176 units, significantly higher than the previous low regime of ~75). Period 20 demand reached 200 units, and on-hand inventory is depleted (0 units). Lead times have improved recently (L=1 for P16, P18), but the promised L is 2. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 1343 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 13 are lost/invalid but still counted in the 'In-transit' total (1769 total). Valid in-transit orders are: P17 (147), P19 (171), and P20 (108), totaling 426 valid units. To force the OR backend's base-stock logic to place an order despite the 1343 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to 'demand * (1+L) + phantom_sum'. Using a forecast demand of 180 units and L=2, the target base stock is roughly 540. With 1343 units effectively acting as a subtraction from this target, mu_hat is set to 1883 (540 + 1343) to bypass the blockage. Sigma is set high to ensure responsiveness to the 200+ demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high for summer season: P17-P20 mean is 176 (+135% vs prior regime). Phantom pipeline inventory remains 1343 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13), requiring manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P17-P21) is significantly higher due to summer seasonality for womens lingerie/under-clothing, with a mean demand of approximately 176 units. Phantom pipeline inventory remains a major issue at 1343 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 are confirmed lost or significantly delayed beyond reasonable lead times). Current total 'In-transit' is 2130 units, but valid pipeline inventory comprises only the orders from P20 (108 units) and P21 (361 units), totaling 469 valid units in transit. To force the OR backend [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] logic to produce a replenishment order, I must set 'mu_hat' to (Demand Forecast * (1+L)) + Phantom_Inventory. Forecasted demand for the next 3 periods is 176*3 = 528. Adding the 1343 phantom units, the target mu_hat is 1871. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high variance observed during this peak period (std of P17-P21 is approximately 17.5, so sqrt(3)*17.5 \u2248 30). This ensures the backend places an order to cover current demand despite the phantom 'In-transit' count.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the product (H&M-style cotton hipster briefs) is in the middle of a high-demand summer season (July). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand from the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has averaged 171.5 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime compared to the spring levels. The 'In-transit' total of 2022 units is heavily skewed by 1343 'phantom' units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) which have not arrived despite many periods passing. The valid pipeline consists of orders from P17 (147 units - overdue), P19 (171 units - overdue), P21 (361 units), and P22 (0 units). Including P17 and P19 as valid is conservative, but P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 are definitely lost. To force the OR backend's capped policy to place an order, I must set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory total (1343). Period demand forecast (L+1=3) is ~515 units. Total target base stock = 515 + 1343 = 1858. Setting mu_hat to 1858 ensures the stock-up logic overrides the phantom inventory presence. Valid lead time recently observed fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods; I will use 'calculate' to reflect recent dynamics while setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' to capture current seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed summer high-demand regime (P17-P22 avg: 171.5). Total phantom inventory remains 1343 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Delivery consistency is failing again with P17 and P19 orders now overdue (L > 3).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand remains in the summer high regime. The average demand from Period 17 to 23 is approximately 170 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 201 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1661 units is heavily inflated by 1343 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Subtracting these phantom units, the valid pipeline is actually 318 units (1661 - 1343). However, looking at the history, orders from P17 and P19 (totaling 147 + 171 = 318 units) are now significantly overdue (L=7 and L=5 respectively). Given the pattern of lost shipments in this game, these 318 units are also likely lost or severely delayed. To trigger an order despite the Orc backend seeing 1661 units in transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the backend's inventory check. I will calculate a target base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1) at 170 units/period (~510 units) and then add the total phantom inventory (1343 + 318 = 1661) to this target. Total mu_hat = 510 + 1661 = 2171 units. Sigma is set based on recent high-regime volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Valid pipeline is now likely zero. Orders from P17 (147 units) and P19 (171 units) reached L=7 and L=5 without arriving, joining previous phantom units. Total phantom/lost inventory estimated at 1661 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we are in the peak summer season for women's lingerie/underwear. Demand has been high since June, with an average of 165 units over the last 8 periods (P17-P24). The 'In-transit' total of 2021 units is severely inflated by 'phantom' or lost orders. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, and P19 (totaling 1661 units) have not arrived within reasonable windows (L > 5 in most cases), making them likely lost. The only potentially valid orders in the pipeline are those from P21 (arrived this period, visible next) and P24 (360 units). However, the system's stock-on-hand is low (63), and the backend logic subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit amount from the target base stock. To bypass this and force an order to maintain service level during this high-demand summer period, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that approximates (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 165 = 495. Total 'In-transit' reported is 2021. To ensure an order of roughly 350-400 units, mu_hat must be set around 2400. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom pipeline inventory total verified as 1661 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19) which have failed to arrive. Valid pipeline consists only of P24 order (360 units). Summer demand regime remains strong (P17-P24 avg: 165).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/05. The SKU is in a high-demand summer regime with a recent mean (P17-P25) of 161.4 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. Total 'In-transit' is 2394 units. However, history confirms significant phantom/lost inventory: P1(152), P3(217), P4(216), P10(349), P13(409), P17(147), and P19(171) have all failed to arrive far beyond their promised lead times or subsequent arrivals. The sum of these lost units is 1861 units. Valid pipeline inventory consists only of P24(360) and P25(373), totaling 733 units. To trigger the OR backend to order when it incorrectly perceives 2394 units in transit, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired base stock targets approx (L+1)*165 = 495 units. To force an order of ~165 units, I set mu_hat = demand_forecast + phantom_inventory = 495 + 1861 = 2356. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the stale stats and manage the phantom inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 1861 units. Orders from P17 (147) and P19 (171) confirmed as lost after 7+ periods. Summer demand regime remains stable with a mean of ~161 units (P17-P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are in a high-demand summer regime (P17-P26 mean: ~160 units). Inventory status: On-hand is 0. Total In-transit is 2431 units, but the Carry-over Insights indicate massive lost/phantom inventory. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, and P19 are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling approximately 1861 phantom units. Valid pipeline inventory consists of orders from P24 (360), P25 (373), P26 (37), and P27 (to be ordered). Total valid pipeline = 770. Total In-transit (2431) - Valid Pipeline (770) = 1661 phantom units. To force the OR backend's capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)] to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat to include this 1661-unit deficit. Calculation: Target base stock for 3 periods (L=2) at 160 units/period = 480 plus safety stock. To overcome the 1661 subtracted by the engine, mu_hat must be ~160 * 3 + 1661 = 2141. Since the cap is approximately (mu_hat / (1+L)) + safety, setting mu_hat high will also raise the cap, allowing the system to restore on-hand inventory. Period 26 demand (156) confirms the sustained summer shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Phantom pipeline inventory estimate remains at 1661 units. Summer demand regime mean (P17-P26) is 160.4 units. On-hand remains critical (0) due to lead time variability and lost shipments.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The summer demand regime (starting Period 17) remains stable with a mean of approximately 160 units (P17-P27 avg: 159.4). In Period 27, the P25 order (373 units) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, providing 222 units on-hand. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 2,058 units. Based on historical data, 1,661 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' or lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). The valid pipeline inventory consists of the P24 order (360 units) and the P26 order (37 units), totaling 397 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 2,058 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, I must manually inflate mu_hat. To induce an order that covers (~3 periods of demand) while bypassing the 1,661 phantom units, mu_hat is set to (3 * 160) + 1661 = 2141. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of the current high-demand regime (~20) scaled for the lead time and review period (sqrt(3) * 20 \u2248 35).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom pipeline inventory remains 1,661 units. Delivery of P25 (L=2) confirms logistics are currently functional for new orders. Demand mean for the summer regime (P17-P27) is 159.4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the summer demand regime (starting Period 17) remains stable with a mean of 156.9 units/period (P17-P28). The total 'In-transit' quantity of 2058 units is heavily inflated by phantom/lost shipments from Periods 1 (152), 3 (217), 4 (216), 10 (349), 13 (409), 17 (147), and 19 (171), totaling 1,661 units. The only valid pipeline inventory is the P24 order (360 units) and P26 order (37 units), totaling 397 units. With on-hand at 89 and L=2, the total availability is ~486 units, which roughly covers 3 periods of the current demand mean (~157 * 3 = 471). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 2058 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to 'demand * (1+L) + total_phantom'. This results in 157 * 3 + 1661 = 2132. Sigma remains based on the stable summer regime variability.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (June-August) has averaged 155.6 units over the last 13 periods (P17-P29). While recent demand (P28-P29) has softened slightly (133, 113), it remains within the seasonal high for this product category. In-transit inventory stands at 2,104 units, but a reconciliation of history shows that 1,661 of these units are phantom/lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). The valid pipeline consists of orders from P24 (360), P26 (37), and P29 (46), totaling 443 units. Since the OR backend sees 2,104 units in-transit, it will not order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to cover the expected base stock plus the phantom sum. Base Stock calculation: L=2, demand=156, Z-score~2.33 (95% service level). Target Base Stock \u2248 (1+2)*156 + 2.33*std*(sqrt(3)) \u2248 468 + 150 \u2248 618. To force the backend to reach this target despite 1,661 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to (618 + 1661) / (1+L) \u2248 2279 / 3 = 759.6. This ensures the available inventory (Total Pipeline - Phantom) meets demand while compensating for the 'black hole' of lost orders. Lead time is set to 2 based on the most recent successful arrival (P25 order arriving in P27).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Validated pipeline is 443 units (P24, P26, P29). Phantom inventory remains 1,661 units. Seasonal high demand regime mean established at 155.6.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). The summer high-demand regime is slightly softening with recent demand (P24-P30) averaging 128 units/period, compared to the peak summer mean of ~160. Total In-transit is 2104 units, but historically significant portions are phantom/lost shipments. Based on previous carry-over insights, the phantom inventory is identified as 1661 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). The valid pipeline contains P24 (360), P26 (37), P29 (46), and P30 (0), totaling 443 units. However, P24 (ordered Period 24) is now at L=7 and P26 (ordered Period 26) is at L=5; given the 'promised' L=2, these are highly likely lost as well. If we treat P24 and P26 as lost, the phantom inventory increases by 397 to 2058 units. Valid pipeline is essentially only P29 (46 units). With 0 on-hand, we need to order. To bypass the OR engine's subtraction of the 2104 'In-transit' units, I set mu_hat to (Demand_Forecast * (L+1)) + Phantom_Inventory. Forecasted demand is ~130. Base stock target for L=2 (3 periods) = 130 * 3 = 390. Total mu_hat = 390 + 2104 = 2494. This forces the engine to place an order roughly equal to the desired base stock plus the gap created by missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Phantom pipeline inventory adjusted to ~2058 units as P24 (360) and P26 (37) are now 3+ periods overdue and confirmed lost, similar to previous patterns. Valid pipeline consists only of P29 (46 units). Demand regime softening towards autumn, current mean ~130.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32 (Sept 16), demand follows a softening autumn trend with a recent mean (P29-P31) of 108 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 2541 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' or lost inventory. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, and P26 are confirmed lost/overdue (totaling ~2058 units). The only valid pipeline inventory is the P29 order (46 units) and the P31 order (437 units), totaling 483 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 2541 units in 'In-transit', I set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired base stock (Target Demand \xd7 [L+1]) and the phantom inventory. Desired base stock for (2+1) periods at 110 units/period is 330 units. Adding the 2058 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 2388. This bypasses the logic where the backend would otherwise see a massive surplus and stop ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Valid pipeline confirmed as 483 units (P29: 46, P31: 437). Phantom inventory has reached approximately 2058 units. Current demand regime is stabilized around 105-115 units per period for the autumn transition.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (Autumn transition). Demand has significantly softened from the summer high of ~160 to a recent mean of (113+116+95+61)/4 = 96.25 units. Period 32 demand was only 61 units, suggesting a continued downward trend. Total in-transit is 2,104 units, but historically ~2,058 units are identified as 'phantom' or lost (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26). Valid pipeline consists only of the P29 order (46 units). On-hand inventory is 376 units. Calculation: Total On-Hand (376) + Valid Pipeline (46) = 422 units. At a forecast of ~96 units/period, 422 units covers over 4 periods of supply (well over L+1). No new order is needed this period. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 2,104 in pipeline and suppressed ordering, I would normally inflate mu_hat; however, since supply is currently sufficient, I will set mu_hat to reflect the lower demand regime (~96 units) and use lead time default. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility during the transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand decreased to ~96 units/period (P29-P32) as summer ends. Total phantom/lost inventory in pipeline remains approximately 2,058 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2824.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has transitioned from the summer high (mean ~160) to a lower autumn level. Recent demand (P29-P33) averages 109 units per period, though P33 showed a spike to 160. Following the strategy of accounting for 'phantom' inventory to ensure the OR backend places orders, I estimate the total phantom/lost units at 2,058. These units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, and P26) are listed in 'In-transit' but are unlikely to arrive. Valid pipeline inventory is currently 46 units (from P29). With 216 units on hand and a target base stock needed to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~100 units/period * 3 = 300), the current systemic inventory (On-hand 216 + In-transit 2104 = 2320) far exceeds the base stock, preventing the OR backend from ordering. To trigger an order for the next cycle, I will set mu_hat to (demand + phantom), which is approximately 110 + 2058. This ensures the backend recognizes a need despite the bloated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand regime for autumn transition stabilized at ~110 units (P29-P33 mean style). Phantom inventory remains stagnant at 2,058 units, requiring mu_hat inflation of approximately 2,100 units to bypass OR backend logic and maintain replenishment.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Date is 2019-10-07. We are in an autumn demand regime with recent demand (P32-P34) averaging 107.7 units. Phantom inventory remains a critical distortion, totaling approximately 2,058 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26) which are severely overdue and confirmed lost. Valid pipeline consists of the P29 order (46 units) and the P34 order (183 units), totaling 229 units. The in-transit figure (2287) is dominated by phantom units. To trigger ordering in the OR backend (which subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock), mu_hat must be inflated. Calculating target base stock for a 3-period horizon (L=2) at ~110 units/period with safety stock (~1.5*sigma) gives ~450. To overcome the 2287 in-transit units, mu_hat is set to 2510 (2287 + 223), which forces the backend to see a 'need' for more units. L is set to explicit 2 (promised). Sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for moderate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 2,058 units. Valid pipeline is P29 (46 units) and P34 (183 units). Current demand regime (P32-P34) mean: 107.7 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019). Seasonal demand transition from summer highs to autumn stability. The recent three-period demand mean (P33-P35) is 123 units, while the six-period mean (P30-P35) is 107 units. Logistics are functional but plagued by a significant volume of 'phantom' inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26) totaling 2,058 units. These units will never arrive but are counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory, preventing the system from placing new orders. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of actual demand PLUS the phantom inventory amount. Actual L is currently 1-2 based on recent history (P31 arrived in 1 period). Strategy: Set L=2 (promised). Use mean demand of ~115. Base stock target = 115 * (2+1) = 345 units. Adjusted mu_hat = 345 + 2058 (phantom) = 2403. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the 2058 unit 'dead' pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 37 (Oct 21). Recent demand (P34-P36) has stabilized around a mean of 110 units/period (102, 107, 121), showing typical autumn consistency for this SKU. Total 'In-transit' is 2321. We have confirmed a massive accumulation of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (152), P3 (217), P4 (216), P10 (349), P13 (409), P17 (147), P19 (171), P24 (360), and P26 (37). Summing these equals 2218 units. Valid pipeline inventory actually consists of: P29 (46 units - very late), P34 (183 units), and P36 (34 units), totaling 263 units (or less if P29 is also lost). The OR backend sees 'In-transit: 2321' and will refuse to order unless mu_hat is inflated to cover the phantom gap. To ensure an order is actually placed to cover the estimated demand of ~110 units per period for (L+1)=3 periods (approx 330 units) plus a safety buffer, I must set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + (Phantom Units). Target base stock ~450. mu_hat = 450 + 2218 = 2668. Calculation: \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L) * mean. With L=2, mean should be ~890. Using explicit mu_hat is the only way to bypass the massive pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Cumulative phantom inventory verified at 2218 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26). Regular orders now arriving with L=1 or L=2 (P31, P35). Autumn demand regime stable at approx 110 units/period.

LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 38 (late October): Demand is transitioning into a stable autumn regime with a recent mean (P32-P37) of ~117 units/period. The 'In-transit' total of 2725 is largely comprised of 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments). Based on Carry-Over Insights, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, and P34 are likely lost. Note: P29 (46 units) and P34 (183 units) have now exceeded promised lead time (L=2) by several periods without arriving. Cumulative phantom inventory is now estimated at 2447 units (previous 2218 + P29: 46 + P34: 183). Valid pipeline inventory consists only of the P37 order (404 units). To trigger the OR backend to order, mu_hat must be inflated to cover the phantom gap. Target base stock = (117 * (2+1) + safety) + 2447. Setting mu_hat to 2850 (approx 2450 phantom + 400 demand) ensures the replenishment logic continues despite the high on-paper pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 2447 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Valid pipeline contains only P37 order (404 units). Demand regime mean (P32-P37) is 117.3 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Ch hipster ctn 3p' (a woman's lingerie staple) is currently in a stable autumn regime. The average demand from Period 32 to Period 38 is approximately 119 units per period. Regarding logistics, the OR backend sees a total 'In-transit' of 2550 units. However, based on history, 2447 of these units are 'phantom' or lost (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Only the P38 order of 229 units is actually valid. Currently, on-hand inventory is 275 units. In the OR logic, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To trigger a necessary replenishment order of approximately 100-150 units, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the phantom pipeline. Required mu_hat \u2248 (Demand x (1+L)) + Phantom Inventory. With L=1 and Demand=120, target mu_hat \u2248 (120 * 2) + 2447 = 2687. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2700 to ensure the backend generates an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. L is set to explicit 1 as recent deliveries (P35, P37) have arrived with a 1-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 2447 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Current demand regime (P32-P38) mean is ~119 units. Delivery lead time has stabilized at 1 period recently.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics environment for SKU 719655001 is characterized by a high volume of lost shipments, creating a significant discrepancy between the OR backend's 'pipeline inventory' and actual valid 'in-transit' units. Currently, the system shows 2,516 units in-transit, but based on the history of missing containers, 2,447 of these are 'phantom' units that will never arrive (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). The only valid pipeline unit was the P36 order (34 units), which arrived in the P39 conclude message. Therefore, the valid pipeline is currently 0. Demand for the current autumn regime (P32-P39) averages approximately 117.5 units per period. To trigger a new order and overcome the 2,516 phantom units being subtracted from the inventory position, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 2750. This value is calculated to exceed the phantom pipeline plus two periods of expected demand (approx 2447 + 235 = 2682), ensuring the OR engine maintains stock levels. Lead time is set to 1, matching the most recent consistent delivery patterns.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Phantom pipeline inventory remains 2,447 units. Delivery of P36 (L=3) confirmed; valid pipeline is now 0 units. Autumn demand regime (P32-P39) mean is stable at 117.5 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-18 (Period 41). The autumn demand regime is stable with a mean of approximately 117.5 units/period (P32-P39). Supply chain issues remain severe: 'In-transit' currently shows 2,638 units, but based on history, the vast majority of these are 'phantom' or lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, and P34 are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 2,447 units. The only valid pipeline units were the P36 order (arrived P39) and the P38 order (229 units) which is now at L=3 and overdue. Additionally, P40 (122 units) is in transit. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive phantom 'In-transit' inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to (Expected Demand \xd7 (1+L)) + Total Phantom Inventory. Target base stock = (118 * 2) + 2447 = 2683. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 1 reflecting recent arrivals (P31, P35, P37), though reliability is low.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative phantom pipeline inventory remains at 2,447 units. The P38 order (229 units) is now 3 periods overdue, potentially joining the phantom list if it does not arrive next period. Autumn demand regime is stable around 118 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a significant in-transit discrepancy. Total in-transit is 2,648 units, but based on history, 2,447 of these are 'phantom' or lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). The P38 order (229 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing the phantom total to 2,676, which exceeds the reported in-transit of 2,648. Effectively, the valid pipeline is 132 units (P40, P41). Recent demand (P32-P41) is stable with a mean of 118.3 units. To trigger ordering despite the large reported in-transit inventory, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a 1-period replenishment window (since recent L=1-2) at approx 240 units (2 periods of demand). To bypass the OR engine's subtraction of 2,648 units, mu_hat is set to 2,888 (2,648 + 240). This allows the system to place a replenishment order of approximately 240 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Cumulative phantom/lost pipeline inventory estimated at 2,648 units (entire reported in-transit), including P38 (229 units) which is now 4 periods overdue. Valid pipeline is effectively 132 units (P40, P41). Demand remains stable at approx 118 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Greta Ch hipster ctn 3p' spiked significantly in Period 42 to 385 units, signaling the start of the December seasonal peak (Christmas shopping). The average demand over the last 11 periods (P32-P42) is approximately 144 units, with a clear upward trend. Meanwhile, the 'In-transit' figure of 2968 units is heavily bloated by phantom pipeline inventory. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34, and now P38 (229 units, 5 periods overdue) are confirmed lost/phantom. The total phantom inventory is estimated at ~2648 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this fake pipeline, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the expected holiday demand and the phantom inventory (Base Stock = Demand + Phantom). I will forecast a holiday mean of 350 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat = (1 + L) * (Forecast + Phantom/3) approximately. Setting mu_hat to 3500 ensures the capped policy triggers a sufficient order to meet the immediate seasonal demand while bypassing the 2968 in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/December demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 385 units (+225% vs autumn mean). Phantom pipeline inventory verified at approximately 2648 units (Total In-transit minus valid orders P40, P41, P42).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/9). Period 42 showed a significant demand spike to 385 units, followed by 111 in Period 43. Historically, December demand for lingerie/briefs tends to stay elevated or spike again around the holidays. The 'In-transit' figure of 3615 units contains 2648 units of 'phantom' inventory (confirmed lost orders from previous periods: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34, and now likely P38). The valid pipeline contains P42 (320 units) and P43 (779 units), totaling 1099 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the massive phantom in-transit inflated figure, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the expected holiday demand (forecasted at ~400 units/period) plus the phantom inventory offset. Required Base Stock = (Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom. With L=2, base stock needs to be ~ (400 * 3) + 2648 = 3848. I will set mu_hat explicitly to this value. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P40, P41) show variability (L=2, L=3), and sigma_hat is set to explicit high volatility (200) to account for holiday demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Valid pipeline inventory is 1099 units (P42, P43). Phantom inventory has increased to 2648 units after P38 (229 units) failed to arrive by Period 43 conclude (L=5). Expected December weekly demand is ~400 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in Period 42 spiked significantly to 385, confirming a holiday seasonal peak for this lingerie SKU, though Periods 43 and 44 showed a temporary dip to ~105-111. Given the calendar (Dec 16), we must anticipate high demand for the remaining two periods (pre-Christmas and end-of-game). The primary challenge continues to be the massive 'phantom' pipeline inventory. As of Period 44 conclude, P42 (320 units), P43 (779 units), and P44 (541 units) are validly in-transit. Total 'In-transit' is 4156. Subtracting valid units (320 + 779 + 541 = 1640) confirms a phantom inventory of 2516 units (matching the previous carry-over of 2447 plus the now likely lost P38). To force the OR engine to order despite this 2516-unit 'ghost' stock, mu_hat must be inflated. Base stock logic: we need to cover the current period + lead time. With a holiday demand forecast of ~400 units/period and L=2, base stock needs to be ~1200. To offset the 2516 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 3716 (approx 1200 + 2516).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Phantom pipeline inventory verified at approximately 2516 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34, P38). Only P42 (320), P43 (779), and P44 (541) are considered valid in-transit. Holiday demand volatility is high.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the peak of the holiday shopping season. Historical demand for this SKU showed a significant spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) at 385 units, likely corresponding to a pre-Christmas/Black Friday event. While demand in the last three weeks (P43-P45) has returned to the autumn baseline (~110 units), the imminent approach of Christmas and end-of-year sales suggests the possibility of another spike or sustained high demand. In terms of logistics, arrivals have resumed (P42 and P43 orders arrived), confirming a current lead time of 2-3 periods. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 3057 units is still heavily inflated by 2516 'phantom' units (confirmed lost orders from P1 through P38). The valid pipeline is actually 541 units (P44 order). With 982 units on-hand, we are well-stocked for the current baseline, but to ensure the OR backend places any necessary replenishment orders despite the massive phantom pipeline, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that accounts for both expected seasonal demand and the phantom inventory offset. Target base stock = (Forecasted Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. Estimated weekly holiday demand is ~350 units. For L=2, (350 * 3) + 2516 = 3566.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed arrivals of P42 (L=3) and P43 (L=2) indicate logistics are functioning, but previous lost units remain in pipeline. Phantom pipeline inventory updated to 2516 units (P38 confirmed lost at L=7). Seasonal holiday baseline approx 350 during peak weeks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Dec 30, right after the Christmas peak. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 385, then dropped to around 105-140 in Periods 43-46. We are currently in the post-holiday lull, where demand typically stabilizes or continues to decline slightly. On-hand inventory is healthy at 842 units due to the arrival of 1,099 units in Period 45. The total in-transit listed is 3,057, but based on history, 2,516 units are confirmed 'phantom' (lost) orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34, P38). The only potentially valid order in the pipeline is P44 (541 units). However, given current on-hand inventory (842) and a post-holiday demand mean of approx 115, we are well-covered for the near term. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the post-spike demand level (~118 units/period). I am maintaining L=2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries (P42, P43) arrived in 2-3 periods. To handle the 2,516 phantom pipeline units that the OR backend treats as real, I'm using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 2,900. This is calculated as: ((1+L) * forecast) + phantom_sum = (3 * 118) + 2,516 = 2,870, rounded to 2,900 to ensure we don't prematurely stop ordering if demand fluctuates slightly upwards.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (late Dec) settled at ~118 units/period. Cumulative phantom pipeline inventory remains 2,516 units.
