Demand analysis: Historical samples show a mean of 112.6 units/week (99, 127, 104, 87, 146). The high of 146 occurred in the most recent week, possibly signaling a slight upward trend or just variance. Inventory status: Currently 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Lead time logic: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the order for Period 1, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods) because the earliest an order placed now can arrive is the start of Period 4. Since current on-hand is 0, the pipeline must be filled immediately. Forecasting a mean of ~115 units per period. Target inventory for 3 periods = 115 * 3 = 345 units.

Period 1 actual demand was 173 units, showing a notable spike. Because I started with 0 inventory, 173 sales were lost. I have 415 units in transit from the Period 1 order.

  "rationale": "Product 719655001 is a basic underwear item (Womens Lingerie/Briefs). Demand has shown two distinct regimes: an initial high-demand period (avg ~140 in Jan/Feb) followed by a stabilization phase. From Period 9 to 13, excluding the P12 spike likely caused by a local promotion or end-of-month effect, demand has averaged around 58 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 895 is heavily skewed by legacy lost orders. Based on history: P1 (415), P3 (50), and P4 (100) are confirmed lost (Total 565). The new In-transit balance of 330 units (895 - 565) corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 13. Since lead time is likely 2 periods, this order of 330 will arrive in Period 15. For the current Period 14, I have 14 units on hand to meet a 1-period demand forecast of ~60. This will likely lead to a stockout in P14. The P13 order (330) will adequately cover P15 and P16 (approx 120 units demand). To maintain a safety buffer for the next delivery cycle (P17-P18), I will place an order now. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a slightly higher inventory position is preferred to avoid stockouts. I will order 150 units to cover estimated demand for P16/P17.",

Carry-over insights confirm that P1 (415), P3 (50), and P4 (100) are lost (total 565 units). Subtracting these from the current 1045 'In-transit' leaves 480 viable units in the pipeline. These 480 units consist of the order from P13 (330 units) and P14 (150 units). Given a lead time of 1-2 periods, these shipments are now overdue (P13 is 4 periods old, P14 is 3 periods old).

Historical demand shows a baseline of ~100-110 in early Q1, peaking at ~180 in summer, and stabilizing around 120-130 in October. However, the last few weeks (P37-P38) show a slight uptick (153, 129), and late November/December typically sees higher retail volume. I forecast demand at ~140 units/period for the upcoming cycle. Regarding supply, our in-transit of 1970 is heavily inflated by 1595 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, P29). Subtracting these, the reliable pipeline is 300 units: P34 (75 units - 5 periods old, potentially risky but not yet confirmed lost), P36 (150 units - 3 periods old), and P38 (150 units). On-hand is 91. Total reliable inventory (91 + 300) = 391. To cover demand for the lead time plus one period (L=2, so 3 periods total) at 140/unit (420 total) plus a safety stock for the end of the year, I need more coverage. I will order 150 units to maintain a healthy buffer against the high variance and potential for lost shipments.",
