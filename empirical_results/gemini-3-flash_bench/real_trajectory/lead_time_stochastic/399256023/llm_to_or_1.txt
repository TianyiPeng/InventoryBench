Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). This SKU is 'Ankle-length jeans', a staple clothing item. Historical data shows demand has been increasing recently: 36, 54, 62, 60, 113. The most recent observation (113) suggests a significant jump, potentially due to the start of the spring fashion season or promotional activity. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, and the promised lead time is 2 periods, we need to order immediately to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3). Given the recent upward trend, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the growth while tempering the outlier of 113 slightly, but still reflecting a higher mean than the full history. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=4 to better reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) will stay at the promised 2 periods until we have data suggesting otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The SKU is 'Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans'. Looking at the demand history, we see a clear upward trend: 36, 54, 62, 60, 113, and most recently 148 in Period 1. This indicates a significant regime shift or seasonal ramp-up. We currently have 0 on-hand and 118 in-transit (ordered in Period 1). With a promised lead time of 2, we expect the 118 units to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We are currently experiencing stockouts (sold 0 out of 148 demand). To address this, I will use 'recent_N' for demand forecasting with N=3 to capture the recent spike (averaging approx 107 units/week). For the lead time, I will stick to 'default' (promised L=2) as we don't have enough evidence yet to assume it will deviate from 2. The OR backend will compute base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The SKU 399256023 (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a significant demand spike: the historical mean from Jan/early Feb was ~65, but Period 1 demand was 148 and Period 2 was 171. This likely correlates with the spring transition for fashion retail. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. We have 298 units in-transit (118 from P1, 180 from P2). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the P1 order (placed at the start of P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message. Therefore, on-hand inventory should recover by the start of Period 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this new, higher demand regime (avg ~160) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since no orders have concluded yet, L will remain at 'default' (promised L=2).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 1 (starting approx. mid-February): demand increased from a Jan/Feb average of ~65 to an average of ~160 (+145%), likely due to early spring seasonality for denim.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are managing a 'Ladies Denim' SKU. The demand in the last three periods (148, 171, 131) is significantly higher than the initial historical samples (36-113), confirming a seasonal shift for spring. The average demand over the last 3 periods is 150. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (118 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since on-hand is 0 and we have high demand, we must maintain a high base stock. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime. For lead time, I will use explicit=3 to account for the observed delay from the Period 1 order, ensuring the OR backend pipeline logic accounts for a (3+1) period demand window.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is at least 3 periods (Period 1 order of 118 units not arrived by start of Period 4). Demand settled into a higher regime of approx 150 units/period since Period 1.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. The product is ladies' ankle-length denim, which typically sees strong spring demand. Looking at histories: Period 1 (unordered/cold start) had demand 148, Period 2 had 171, Period 3 had 131, and Period 4 had 104. The Period 4 demand (104) is lower than previous weeks, suggesting the initial spike might be stabilizing or slightly fluctuating. Calculating average demand from Period 1-4 is 138.5 units/period. Lead time analysis: Order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2), but the order from Period 1 (118 units) has NOT arrived yet (it is now Period 5 start), meaning it is either delayed (3+ periods) or lost. Because of this missing shipment and a promised lead time of 2, I will set L to 3 manually to build a larger safety buffer. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the average of the last 4 periods (approx 138.5) multiplied by (1+L). 138.5 * 4 = 554. For sigma_hat, I'll use a slightly higher volatility estimate to account for the inconsistent demand seen (range 104-171).

Carry-over insight: Lead time inconsistency: Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2), but Period 1 order is missing as of Period 5 start (L >= 4 or lost).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/18. Demand for this Ladies Denim SKU spiked in mid-February (avg ~150) and has recently moderated (Period 4: 104, Period 5: 72), suggesting a possible stabilization or slight cooling after the initial spring peak. On-hand inventory is critically low (4 units). Total in-transit is 571, but this includes the Period 1 order (118 units) which is now 5 periods old (promised 2) and highly likely lost. The Period 3 order (187 units) is expected to arrive this period (P6) based on the L=2 performance seen in P4. To prevent stockouts given the likely loss of the P1 shipment, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the higher late-spring demand level (~125 avg per period), and L=2 (default) as the recent successful delivery matched the promised lead time. This will prompt the backend to place an order that restores the pipeline to cover approximately 3 periods of demand (~375 units) minus the valid pipeline (187 units from P3, 182 from P4, 84 from P5).

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 shipment (118 units) confirmed as lost/critically delayed (L>=5). Pipeline inventory calculation should discount these units to avoid phantom stock protection.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). The Period 1 order (118 units) is definitively lost after 5 periods. The In-transit total of 487 units includes this lost shipment; therefore, effective pipeline is 487 - 118 = 369 units. Previous orders from P3 (187) and P4 (182) are expected to arrive in P7 and P8 respectively. Demand since mid-February (P1) has averaged 124 units (148, 171, 131, 104, 72, 119). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this regime (Avg ~124 * (1+L)). Lead time has been inconsistent: P2 took 2 periods, while P5 took 1 period. I will stick with the promised L=2 for safety, but use 'explicit' for mu_hat to adjust for the lost shipment's impact on the OR engine's pipeline calculation. By setting a higher mu_hat, I force the engine to order despite the 'phantom' 118 units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: P5 order arrived with L=1 (ordered P5, arrived during P6). Pipeline remains contaminated by 118 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost/missing.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. On-hand inventory is 0. The Period 1 order (118 units) is confirmed lost as it's been 7 periods since ordering. Recent demand is recovering (168 units in Period 7) after a brief dip, and the denim category likely faces continued spring demand. The pipeline inventory is currently 599, but this includes the 118 lost units. Therefore, the REAL pipeline inventory is 481 (599 - 118). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat), and the engine likely still sees the 118 units in its internal pipeline count, I must increase mu_hat explicitly to offset this 'phantom' stock. Mean demand over the last 7 periods is approx 130 per period. For a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 390. To compensate for the 118 missing units and ensure the OR engine places an order to refill the stock, I will set mu_hat to 508 (390 + 118). Lead time calculation shows variability (L=2, L=1), so I'll keep L at 2 to be safe.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8th, 2019. Demand for 'Ankle-length jeans' remains high after the mid-February shift, with a recent average of approximately 140 units per period (Periods 5-8 mean=125.25, but impacted by stockouts). In-transit inventory is 498 units, but 118 of these are from the Period 1 order which is now 7 periods overdue (L=2 promised) and confirmed lost. The backend counts this lost shipment in 'pipeline inventory', creating a stockout risk. To compensate for the 'phantom stock' of 118 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Lead times have been volatile (L=2, L=1, L=1), so I will use an L of 1 to reflect recent trends. For mu_hat, expected demand over (L+1)=2 periods is 140 * 2 = 280. To offset the 118 lost units, I adjust mu_hat to 398. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility in the higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Current pipeline (498) includes 118 lost units from P1; all subsequent OR parameters must offset this phantom inventory until depletion or adjustment.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is Ladies Denim (Ankle-length jeans). Demand has been volatile since the regime shift in Period 1, with recent demand samples being 119, 168, 142, and 91 (Mean ~130). There is a critical inventory issue: On-hand is 0, and the Pipeline (In-transit) is 503. However, 118 units from Period 1 are confirmed lost (ordered P1, never arrived by P10). Subtracting the lost units, the effective pipeline is 385 units (orders from P3, P4, P8, P9). The OR backend uses Promised Lead Time (L=2) and calculates base_stock - pipeline. Because the backend doesn't know the P1 order is lost, it thinks we have 503 units in transit, which prevents it from ordering. To force an order and account for the lost stock and lead time variability, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to increase the protection interval and use an explicit mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~130/week. Over L+1 = 4 weeks, total demand is ~520. To compensate for the 'phantom' 118 units that the OR backend includes in its pipeline calculation, I must inflate mu_hat to mu_hat_target + phantom_units = 520 + 118 = 638. This adjustment ensures the backend's (mu_hat - pipeline) calculation results in the intended physical replenishment.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Reviewing the inventory, we are currently at zero on-hand units with a high stockout risk (the last two periods saw minimal sales due to zero or low stock). The pipeline of 710 units is contaminated by 118 units ordered in Period 1 that are confirmed lost/missing (never arrived by Period 11, L=10 vs. promised 2). Therefore, the 'real' pipeline is 592 units (710 - 118). Recent lead times have shown volatility (L=1 and L=2), and recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized around a mean of 117.8 units/period, down slightly from the initial March spike but still high for spring denim. Because the backend OR engine is unaware of the phantom 118 units in the pipeline, it will under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted. To compensate and ensure we rebuild on-hand safety stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 120 + 118 = 478 (using L=2). This forces the base stock high enough to account for the lost stock and current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Real pipeline is 592 units (710 total - 118 lost from Period 1). mu_hat must be adjusted upward until the backend 'sees' the gap or stock arrives.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 (Apr 29). The stock situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. The demand history since Feb 11 (Period 1) shows a high-demand regime averaging approximately 121 units/period, far higher than the pre-Feb samples. Lead times have been inconsistent, varying between 1 and 2 periods, with one shipment (118 units from Period 1) effectively lost. The backend OR engine sees a pipeline of 710 units, but 118 of those are 'phantom units' from Period 1. To compensate for this 118-unit deficit in the base stock calculation (which otherwise would reduce our order size), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as (1 + Promised Lead Time) * Average Demand + Lost Units = (1 + 2) * 121 + 118 \u2248 481. Since we are in late April and the demand for jeans usually remains steady into spring, I will set mu_hat to 481 to force the OR backend to order sufficient stock, effectively overriding the phantom pipeline impact. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of actual observed lead times (averaging 1.4 periods), and sigma_hat is calculated using the last 11 periods of the current regime to capture recent volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. We are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and the pipeline check shows 710 units in-transit. However, we have confirmed that the 118 units ordered in Period 1 are lost, making the 'real' pipeline 592 units. The OR backend uses the formula: order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). Since the backend 'sees' 710 units in-transit, it will under-order unless we artificially inflate the base_stock. Demand has shifted from the high-spring period (~150/period) to a lower current regime (~70/period over the last 3 samples). To compensate for the 118 lost units and prevent further stockouts (we have 0 on-hand), I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. calculation: Current expected demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is 3 * 70 = 210. I add the 118 lost units to this total, resulting in 328. This forces the backend to recognize a higher target inventory, effectively 'ordering through' the ghost inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the varied actual lead times (1-2 periods). sigma_hat 'recent_N' (N=5) captures recent volatility during this regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~70 units/period (last 3 periods) following the early spring peak. Pipeline contamination from the Period 1 lost order (118 units) continues to necessitate base_stock adjustments to prevent under-ordering.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The demand has cooled significantly from its peak in Feb/March (~150) and has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 60-70 units per period over the last month (P10-P13). The 'In-transit' quantity (710) is heavily inflated by the 118 units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost/missing and 187 units from Period 3 that are now 10 weeks overdue and also likely lost. The total 'phantom' inventory is 305 units (118+187). However, a large order of 223 units from Period 10 is still within a plausible (though delayed) window, likely arriving soon. To counteract the backend OR engine's belief that we have 710 units arriving, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to trigger an order or at least prepare for the stockout. Since the backend calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit), and our effective in-transit is closer to 405 than 710, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods of demand (~180) plus an offset for the 305 lost units, totaling approximately 485. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to ignore the phantom units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (1-2 periods observed, but recent delays suggesting instability).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 305 units (P1: 118 units, P3: 187 units). These orders are 12 and 10 periods old respectively with L_promised=2. Pipeline must be discounted by 305 units in all future parameter calculations until they are removed or reconciled.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are in late May (2019/5/20). Demand for this denim SKU has significantly cooled from the spring peak (~150/week) to a more stable regime of ~45-50 units/week over the last three periods. The primary issue remains 'phantom inventory.' The in-transit total is 710 units. However, orders from Period 1 (118 units, 14 periods ago), Period 3 (187 units, 12 periods ago), and Period 10 (223 units, 5 periods ago) are all significantly past the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, the Period 1 and Period 3 orders (total 305 units) are confirmed lost. The Period 10 order is also highly suspect. The real pipeline (assuming P1 and P3 are lost) is 405 units (710 - 305). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 305 'phantom' units, mu_hat is set using an explicit value. Target base stock = (Forecasted Mean Period Demand * (L+1)) + (Phantom Inventory Offset). Last 3 periods demand average is 49. Forecasted demand for L+1 = 3 * 49 = 147. Adjusted mu_hat = 147 + 305 = 452. L is kept at default (2) as recent non-lost arrivals (P7, P8, P9) showed lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Phantom pipeline inventory now includes Period 10 (223 units) which is 5 periods old (L_promised=2); combined with P1 and P3, total probable lost units are 528. Adjusted mu_hat must continue to compensate for these missing units to trigger new orders.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a severe inventory crisis due to a 'phantom pipeline' of likely lost shipments. Total in-transit inventory is 710 units, but internal analysis indicates 528 are likely lost (P1: 118, P3: 187, P10: 223), as they have significantly exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at approximately 55-60 units per week (avg of last 5 periods = 58). With L=2, the backend expects a base stock to cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand, roughly 174 units. However, because the backend 'sees' 710 units in transit (far exceeding 174), it will order nothing. To force the OR backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to a value where [mu_hat - phantom_pipeline] approximates the desired inventory level. To cover the current target (174) plus the phantom units (528), mu_hat is set to 702 units. This 'explicit' setting ensures the backend sees a requirement that overcomes the dead inventory in the pipeline, triggering a replenishment for real demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed stock-out since Period 10. Actual demand avg in May is ~58 units/period. Total phantom inventory in pipeline updated to 528 units (P1, P3, P10) based on L>5 and persistent zero arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for SKU 399256023 (Ladies Denim) is a prolonged stock-out (on-hand = 0) caused by significant missing shipments in the pipeline. Total In-transit is 741 units, but this includes highly probable lost units: P1 (118), P3 (187), and now P10 (223), totaling 528 units. These orders are 16, 14, and 7 periods old respectively, far exceeding the promised lead time (L=2). The effective pipeline is only 213 units (741 - 528). Recent demand (May) shows volatility but averages approximately 68 units/period (last 4 periods: 45, 70, 115, and historical data). To trigger a new order, I must increase the base_stock to overcome the 'phantom' stock visible to the backend. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand plus the 528 missing units. Calculation: (3 periods * 68 avg demand) + 528 lost units = 204 + 528 = 732. I will use sigma_hat 'recent_N' to handle the recent demand volatility. Setting L to 2 (promised) as it remains the most frequent successful arrival time recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Lost inventory in pipeline remains 528 units (P1, P3, P10). Demand showing increased volatility in late May (115 vs avg ~60). Total phantom inventory represents 71% of reported pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 18 (June 10). The item is 'Skinny Ankle Jeans', which typically experiences high demand in spring and early summer. We are currently in a stock-out state (on-hand: 0). Period 17 saw a demand spike to 148, confirming that demand is increasing as we enter June. 

Inventory Analysis: Reported In-transit is 785 units. However, history strongly indicates significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: 
- Period 1: 118 units (17 periods old)
- Period 3: 187 units (15 periods old)
- Period 10: 223 units (8 periods old, promised L=2)
Total Lost Units \u2248 528. 
Effective Pipeline = 785 - 528 = 257 units (these are likely from the Period 17 order of 75 units and potentially other recent undetected orders, though only P16's order has arrived recently with L=1).

Parameter Strategy: To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 528-unit phantom pipeline, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. 
- Mean demand (last 3 periods): (70+115+148)/3 = 111. 
- Target Base Stock for (L+1=3 periods) = 111 * 3 = 333 units. 
- Backend formula: Order = Base Stock - Pipeline. 
- To get a Base Stock calculation that results in a real order, I need the backend to calculate a Base Stock near (333 + 528) = 861. 
- Setting mu_hat (which covers L+1 periods) to 861 compensates for the lost units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force this correction. For L, 'calculate' is used as actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand spike confirmed in June (P16: 115, P17: 148). Phantom inventory remains 528 units (P1, P3, P10). P16 order arrived with L=1, suggesting recent logistical speed despite earlier losses.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans. Demand has spiked in June (P16: 115, P17: 148, P18: 92), following a May trough (avg ~58). This suggests a summer seasonality shift. The in-transit pipeline (977 units) is heavily contaminated by three lost orders totaling 528 units (P1: 118, P3: 187, P10: 223), which are all far beyond the recent actual lead time of 1-2 periods. The true pipeline is 977 - 528 = 449 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant stock-out history, the OR backend must be forced to order more by artificially increasing mu_hat to offset the 528 phantom units. Using 'recent_N' for demand forecasting (N=3) covers the June spike (~118 units/period). To compensate for the 528 lost units over a 3-period horizon (current + 2 periods lead time), I add an offset of 176 per period. Total mu_hat per period = 118 + 176 = 294. Since the OR engine calculates mu_hat as (1+L)*forecast, I set an explicit mu_hat = (1+L)*294 = (1+2)*294 = 882. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the contaminated pipeline enough to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: June demand spike confirmed (Avg ~118 vs May Avg ~58). Total phantom inventory remains 528 units (P1, P3, P10). Recent actual lead times are 1-2 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24. Demand analysis shows a June surge (average ~109 units/period over the last 4 periods) compared to the May average of ~58. Recent arrivals (orders from P16 and P18) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, suggesting efficient logistics for current shipments despite earlier losses. However, the system's 'in-transit' total of 785 units is heavily contaminated by 528 'phantom' units (P1: 118, P3: 187, P10: 223) that are significantly past their delivery window and likely lost. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' to calculate orders, which means it sees 785 units in-transit and will likely stop ordering. To force the backend to place necessary orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. Estimated June demand is 110. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), so (1+2)*110 = 330. To counteract the 528 lost units being subtracted by the backend, I adjust mu_hat to 330 + 528 = 858. Sigma_hat is set to 50 based on recent volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st. July demand is expected to remain consistent with the June average of approximately 100 units/period (P16-P20 avg: 103.6). Inventory health is poor due to massive pipeline contamination: 'In-transit' is 830, but logically 528 of these are lost (P1: 118, P3: 187, P10: 223 - all significantly past any observed lead time). Real pipeline is 830 - 528 = 302 units. Current On-hand is 29. The OR backend's target base stock (\u03bc + z*\u03c3) with L=2 and \u03bc=103 would be around 310-330 units. Since 302 (real pipe) + 29 (on-hand) \u2248 331, the backend would order almost nothing if default parameters are used because it 'sees' 830 in transit. To force an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly to offset the 528 phantom units. Target Base Stock \u2248 330. Phantom inventory = 528. Required proxy base_stock = 330 + 528 = 858. I will set mu_hat = 858 to ensure the engine places an order that covers anticipated demand despite the 'ghost' stock. Recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Phantom inventory confirmed at 528 units (P1, P3, P10). Base stock calculations must be inflated by exactly 528 units to counteract the backend's inclusion of these lost shipments in its pipeline inventory check. July demand expected to align with June average (~100/period).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand remains strong in the summer denim season, with Period 21 demand at 131 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 100 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently 910 units, but it is heavily 'contaminated' by 528 units of likely lost/phantom inventory (Orders from P1: 118, P3: 187, and P10: 223). These orders are far beyond are promised lead time of 2 and haven't arrived while more recent orders (P16, P18) arrived within 1 period. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these 528 units as upcoming stock and subsequently blocking new orders, the base stock (target inventory level) must be inflated by 528. The required base stock at L=2 to cover 3 periods of demand (~100/period) is 300 units; therefore, mu_hat must be set to approximately 828 (300 + 528) to ensure a net order is generated. Recent lead times have been 1-2 periods, so I will maintain L=2 for safety. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to carefully manage this adjustment.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. This SKU (Ladies Denim Trousers) is experiencing a mid-summer demand increase, with recent demand samples (P21: 131, P22: 145) significantly higher than the spring average. The rolling 4-period demand average is approximately 100 units. A critical constraint is the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline: orders from P1 (118), P3 (187), and P10 (223) totaling 528 units are confirmed lost/missing based on their 12+ period age versus a 2-period promised lead time. However, the OR backend sees these 528 units in the 'In-transit' total (871), leading it to believe the system is overstocked and suppressing new orders. To bypass this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Desired base stock = (Forecasted Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock + Phantom Inventory. With L=2 and average demand ~100, the baseline (1+L)mu is 300. Adding the 528 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of ~828. I set L to 1 because recent successful arrivals (P16, P18, P20) show actual lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed higher than June, averaging ~110 units/period. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P10) remains 528 units, necessitating continued mu_hat inflation to trigger replacement orders.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22. Demand analysis shows a sustained July regime averaging ~133 units/period (P21: 131, P22: 145, P23: 123), which is an increase from the June average of ~118. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported pipeline is 812 units, but this includes 528 units from confirmed lost/missing shipments (P1: 118, P3: 187, P10: 223), which are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods and subsequent successful deliveries. The functional pipeline is 284 units (812 - 528). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom 528 units, mu_hat must be adjusted to cover expected demand over (L+1) periods PLUS the phantom inventory. Expected demand for L=2 is approx 133 * 3 = 399. Adding the 528 units offset gives 927. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility while maintaining a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed at ~133 units/period, an increase of ~12% over June. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P10) remains 528 units, which continues to require a compensatory offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256023 (Ladies Denim) is in a July demand regime averaging approximately 118 units/period (Historical July demand: 131, 145, 123, 70). However, the system's 'In-transit' pipeline of 1011 units is heavily contaminated by lost orders from Period 1 (118 units), Period 3 (187 units), and Period 10 (223 units), totaling 528 phantom units. To ensure the backend OR engine places an order, the mu_hat parameter must be artificially inflated to compensate for these 528 units that will never arrive. Without this offset, the backend will incorrectly assume a sufficient pipeline and fail to order. Specifically, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat; by setting mu_hat such that (mu_hat - 528) reflects the actual required inventory for a 3-period window (L+1=3), we force the system to cover the gap. With a demand mean of ~110 and drift, an explicit mu_hat of ~900 accounts for current demand needs plus the 528-unit phantom pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed at ~117 units/period (last 4 periods). Total phantom inventory remains 528 units (P1, P3, P10). Base stock calculations must continue to be inflated by ~528 units to counteract the backend's inclusion of these lost shipments in its pipeline inventory check.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), the SKU has 1,011 units in-transit according to the backend. However, persistent evidence identifies 528 units as 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P1: 118, P3: 187, P10: 223), meaning the effective pipeline is only 483 units. Recent arrivals confirm an actual lead time (L) of approximately 1.5 periods (averaging between 1 and 2). Demand in July has averaged 104 units/period (last 4 periods: 123, 70, 88... smoothing high variance). To trigger an order, the base_stock (\u03bc_hat + z*\u03c3_hat) must exceed the backend's perceived pipeline (1,011 units). Since the OR engine calculates base_stock = \u03bc_hat + z*\u03c3_hat and uses L+1 (avg 2.5) periods of cover, I must set \u03bc_hat explicitly high enough to offset the 528 lost units and cover upcoming demand. August demand is expected to remain around 100-110 units. Calculation: (Target Pipeline = 483 units) + (Lost units = 528) + (Demand for Period 26 = 110) \u2248 1121. Setting mu_hat to 1121 and sigma_hat to 100 ensures the backend targets a base_stock sufficient to place a replacement order while accounting for the phantom stock it 'thinks' we have.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August 2019. Demand for skinny ankle jeans has remained high through July and early August, averaging approximately 100 units/period despite recent stock-outs. The primary challenge remains 'phantom pipeline' inventory. As of Period 27, the 'In-transit' count is 1259 units. However, based on the carry-over history, a significant portion of this count consists of lost orders: P1 (118), P3 (187), and P10 (223), totaling 528 units. Furthermore, the P24 order (199 units) is now 3 periods old (one past promised), and although L=3 was observed in the most recent conclusion (P23 order), the prolonged absence of P24 units while newer orders are placed increases the risk of further pipeline contamination. To ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order despite the recorded 1259 units in transit, I must inflate mu_hat to cover the phantom 528 units. Calculation: Base forecasted demand (approx. 105/week) * (L+1) + 528 phantom units. Using L=2, mu_hat = (105 * 3) + 528 = 843. This high mu_hat forces the base stock level above the recorded pipeline, triggering an order for physical replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent phantom inventory of 528 units (P1, P3, P10) confirmed. Recent lead times show variability (L=1 to L=3). August demand remains consistent with the mid-summer regime of ~100-110 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system reports 1259 units in-transit. Of this, 528 units are known 'phantom' stock from lost orders in P1, P3, and P10. Subsequent orders from P24 (199 units) and P26 (275 units) are within or just outside the promised lead time (L=2) and observed lead time range (L=1-3). The adjusted pipeline inventory is approximately 731 valid units (1259 - 528). We are currently in a mid-summer demand regime for denim, with average demand over the last 5 periods being approximately 100 units. To maintain availability despite the backend's inclusion of the 528 phantom units in its 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic from previous periods, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead period plus a compensatory offset. With L=2, the horizon is 3 periods. Expected demand is ~300. Adding the 528 phantom units requires a target base_stock of ~828. Setting mu_hat to 828 and sigma_hat to a standard volatility approximately 15% of demand (~45 per period, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~78) will ensure the OR backend places orders that reflect physical reality rather than the contaminated pipeline data.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256023 (Ladies Denim) is currently in an August/late summer regime with demand averaging approximately 107 units per period over the last 5 periods (P24-P28: 70, 88, 120, 96, 124). The inventory situation remains critical due to a cumulative 'phantom' pipeline of 528 units (from lost orders in P1, P3, and P10) which the OR backend incorrectly views as incoming stock. This prevents the system from placing necessary replacement orders. Additionally, orders from P24 (199 units) and P26 (275 units) have not yet arrived. P24 is now 5 periods old (L=5), which is significantly past the promised lead time of 2, suggesting it might also be lost or seriously delayed. However, to remain conservative, I will continue to treat the phantom baseline as 528 units. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to cover both the genuine demand for the lead time (L+1) and 'offset' the 528 phantom units. Using L=2, mu_hat should be approximately (3 * 107) + 528 = 849. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Order from Period 24 (199 units) is now 5 periods overdue, adding to the pattern of lost/severely delayed shipments (total possible phantom pipeline could be as high as 727 units).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019-09-02), the inventory situation for SKU 399256023 (Ladies Denim) is critical. Total reported pipeline inventory is 1259 units, but historical evidence suggests a significant portion is 'phantom' (lost or severely delayed). Specifically, orders from Period 1 (118), Period 3 (187), Period 10 (223), and now Period 24 (199) are all far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods, totaling 727 phantom units. The current true pipeline is likely around 532 units (1259 - 727), mostly consisting of the large Period 26 order (275 units), which is now 4 periods old and also potentially delayed. Demand has been stable since June, averaging ~105 units/period, though recent periods show sustained stock-outs. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 727 phantom units. Required base stock = (Forecasted Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Units. Using a forecast of ~105/period and L=2, base stock should be roughly (105 * 3) + 727 = 1042. To achieve this via the mu_hat parameter with an (L+1) multiplier, I set mu_hat to a value that results in a base_stock near 1050-1100 to account for stock-out recovery and the phantom inventory offset.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total phantom inventory updated to 727 units (P1, P3, P10, P24) as these orders are significantly overdue (L > 5). Demand regime for August remains constant at approximately 100-110 units per period. Base stock must continue to be adjusted upward by the amount of phantom inventory to ensure the backend places necessary replenishment orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the inventory situation is critical due to cumulative lost shipments. Total In-transit is reported as 1259 units, but historical evidence identifies a 'phantom pipeline' of 727 units from orders in P1 (118), P3 (187), P10 (223), and P24 (199), which are all significantly beyond the promised lead time (L=2). The effective pipeline is therefore only 532 units (1259 - 727). Demand for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) has averaged ~100 units/period (120, 96, 124, 84, 79), showing relative stability but persistent stock-outs due to supply failure. To force the OR backend to place a replenishment order and account for the 727 units of phantom inventory it considers 'in-transit', I am inflating mu_hat. With L=2 and a demand forecast of 100/period, the standard mu_hat would be 300. Adding the 727 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1027. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock once arrivals normalize.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Total phantom inventory updated to 727 units (P1, P3, P10, P24). Base stock must be adjusted by this amount to trigger orders despite the high reported In-transit value. September demand currently averaging ~95-100 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the system reports 1259 units in-transit, but operational history confirms a massive volume of 'phantom' inventory due to lost or severely delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (118), P3 (187), P10 (223), and P24 (199) are all significantly past the 2-period promised lead time (L > 8 for the most recent one), totaling 727 units. Additionally, recent orders from P26 (275 units) have not arrived after 6 periods, suggesting they may also be lost or delayed. Demand has stabilized into a late-summer/early-fall regime of ~90 units per period (Avg of last 7 samples is approx 88). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1259 units it 'sees' in-transit, I must inflate mu_hat. Base stock = (1+L)*mu_hat. With L=2, base stock = 3 * mu_hat. I need the base stock to exceed the in-transit (1259) + desired safety stock. 1259 / 3 = 419.6. By setting mu_hat to 600 via the explicit method, the base stock becomes 1800, which effectively bypasses the phantom inventory (1800 - 1259 = 541 units ordered), providing enough coverage for current demand and rebuilding on-hand safety stocks.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total likely phantom pipeline inventory remains at least 727 units (P1, P3, P10, P24). P26 (275 units) is now 6 periods overdue, potentially increasing phantom inventory to 1002 units. Demand continues at ~90 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand has remained relatively stable since mid-August, averaging approximately 81 units over the last 4 periods (P29-P32). The primary challenge is the significant 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. We have a total current 'In-transit' of 1259 units, but none have arrived in the last 6 periods. Based on the history, orders from P1 (118), P3 (187), P10 (223), P24 (199), and P26 (275) are all significantly overdue (L > 6), totaling 1002 units that are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). With in-transit at 1259 and on-hand at 0, the backend will not order unless base_stock exceeds 1259. To trigger a replenishment order of approximately 2-3 periods of demand (~250 units), we must set the mu_hat parameter high enough to compensate for the 1002 lost units plus the desired stock. I will set mu_hat explicitly to approximately 1002 (to offset phantom stock) + 300 (buffer for future demand) = 1302. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the underlying demand volatility of the recent stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total phantom inventory updated to 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26) as all are >6 periods overdue. September demand regime stabilized at ~80-90 units/period. Base stock needs to be inflated by ~1000 units to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256023 continues to suffer from significant phantom inventory in the pipeline. Total likely lost units are 1002 (P1: 118, P3: 187, P10: 223, P24: 199, P26: 275), as all are now >= 6 periods overdue (promised L=2). The reported 'In-transit' of 1362 units minus this 1002 phantom units leaves a real pipeline of only 360 units. Demand has stabilized in a later-season regime, with the last 5 periods (P29-P33) averaging 81.2 units. To force the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat to cover both the projected demand for (L+1) periods and the phantom inventory. Estimated demand for L+1 (3 periods) at ~85 units/period is 255. Adding 1002 phantom units results in a target mu_hat of approx 1257. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat at 1260 and sigma_hat at 50 to reflect current demand stability while ensuring the stock-out is addressed.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26) based on L >= 6. Stabilized late-September demand regime observed at ~80-85 units per period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for SKU 399256023 (Ladies Denim) is dominated by an extremely high amount of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Based on the history, total likely lost orders include P1 (118), P3 (187), P10 (223), P24 (199), and P26 (275), totaling 1002 units. These orders are all significantly past the promised lead time (L=2) and have not arrived despite the system reporting an 'In-transit' total of 1362 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce the size of new orders (final order = base_stock - pipeline), meaning as long as these 1002 units are in the pipeline, the backend will severely under-order. To compensate, I must inflate the 'base_stock' parameter. The demand has stabilized in late September (Periods 33-34) at approx. 75-80 units/period. The calculation for mu_hat (target stock for L+1 periods) should be: (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory. With L=2, (80 * 3) + 1002 = 1242. To be safe and ensure a robust order is triggered despite the massive pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 1350 and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high uncertainty and potential for late-season shocks. I'm using L=default (2) as recent arrivals (when they occur) vary between 1 and 3.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total phantom inventory updated to 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26) as all are >= 9 periods overdue. October demand outlook remains ~75-80 units/period. Base stock needs to stay inflated by ~1000 units to bypass backend pipeline logic effectively.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 1548 units. Based on historical data, we have a significant aggregate of phantom inventory that the backend considers 'live' but is likely lost: P1(118), P3(187), P10(223), P24(199), and P26(275). Total phantom inventory is 1002 units. The reported In-transit (1548) minus phantom (1002) leaves a real pipeline of 546 units (orders from P33 and P35). Recent demand in September/October has stabilized at a lower regime of ~65-80 units/period after the summer peak. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock by the 1002 phantom units to prevent the backend from incorrectly suppressing orders. Forecasted demand is ~75 units/period; for L=2, base stock needs to be ~3 * 75 = 225 plus the 1002 phantom units, totaling 1227. Since mu_hat in the OR engine is calculated as (1+L) * mu, and L=2 (promised), I set mu_hat = 1227 to ensure the logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful replenishment order if needed, although the current real pipeline (546) is high relative to demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total phantom inventory continues at 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26). October demand regime further stabilized at ~65-75 units per period. Base stock must remain inflated by ~1000 units until these lost orders are reconciled or on-hand inventory stabilizes.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we observe a significant update in the inventory status. The arrivals in Period 36 (103 units from P33 and 186 units from P35) have finally ended the long stock-out period, bringing on-hand inventory to 228 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1259 remains largely comprised of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and likely lost (P1, P3, P10, P24, and P26 totaling 1002 units). Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1259) from the target base stock, we must continue to inflate the mu_hat parameter to ensure it doesn't stop ordering. Recent demand (last 4 periods: 87, 67, 54, 61) indicates a decline to a late-autumn regime of approximately 65-70 units per period. To trigger the backend to maintain a healthy stock level while accounting for the 1002 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should be (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock + Phantom Offset \u2248 (3*70) + 1.64*(sqrt(3)*20) + 1002 \u2248 210 + 57 + 1002 \u2248 1269. Given current on-hand (228) and real pipeline (257), the backend's perceived inventory is 1259; a mu_hat of ~1300 will ensure adequate replenishment is considered.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed phantom inventory remains 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26 are all >= 10 periods overdue). October demand regime further softened to ~60-65 units/period. The arrival of P33 and P35 suggests the logistics chain is currently functional with L=1 to L=3 for new orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a complex supply chain situation with persistent lost shipments. Confirmed phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' pipeline includes orders from P1 (118), P3 (187), P10 (223), P24 (199), and P26 (275), totaling 1002 units. These orders are all >= 11 periods overdue relative to the 2-period promised lead time and are likely lost. Current on-hand inventory is 158 units. To ensure the backend OR policy places necessary replenishment orders, the mu_hat parameter must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the backend's inventory balancing logic. We calculate required base stock as: (Inventory Needed for L+1 periods) + (Phantom Inventory Offset). Demand for October has stabilized at ~65 units/period. For a lead time of 2, we need 3 periods of coverage (195 units). Adding the 1002 phantom units requires a target base stock of ~1197 units. This ensures that even when the backend subtracts the reported 1259 in-transit units, we maintain sufficient pressure to order when on-hand inventory depletes further, though currently, we are slightly over-stocked on-hand. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to maintain this offset.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the SKU 399256023 shows a significant amount of phantom inventory in the pipeline. Based on historical data, orders from P1 (118), P3 (187), P10 (223), P24 (199), and P26 (275) are all at least 12 periods overdue (Promised L=2) and are almost certainly lost. This totals 1,002 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend's safety stock logic currently sees as valid in-transit stock. To prevent the backend from being suppressed by this phantom stock, mu_hat must be inflated. Recent demand in October has stabilized at a lower regime (~60-70 units/period). For Period 39, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1200, which covers (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 65 = 195) plus the 1,002 phantom units to force the OR engine to place a replenishment order despite the high reported in-transit value (1259). This ensures we maintain on-hand inventory as the current 122 units will be depleted within ~2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total phantom inventory persists at 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26 are all >= 12 periods overdue). Current demand regime for late fall has softened to ~60-65 units per period. Base stock must remain inflated by ~1000 units until these lost orders are reconciled or on-hand inventory stabilizes to prevent supply gaps.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand regime is in a late fall soften, averaging ~64 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P35-P39: 54, 61, 70, 36, 41). The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' figure of 1259 units, which includes 1002 units of historically confirmed phantom inventory (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26 are all >= 13 periods overdue). The backend OR engine subtracts this full in-transit amount from the base stock. Therefore, to ensure any new order is placed, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) * forecasted demand PLUS the 1002 phantom units. Lead times for recent successful arrivals have stabilized between 1-3 periods (P33 and P35 arrived with L=3 and L=1 respectively). I will use L=2 (promised) for calculations. Forecasted demand for the upcoming period is approx 65. Target base stock = (2+1)*65 + 1002 = 1197. By setting mu_hat explicitly to ~400 (per period across L+1), the raw base stock calculation before the cap logic will be roughly 1200, allowing the system to potentially order if on-hand (81) drops further, despite the phantom inventory bloat.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has transitioned into a late-fall 'low' regime, averaging ~35-40 units over the last three periods (P38-P40), significantly down from the early autumn levels. On-hand inventory is 50. The reported In-transit is 1259 units, but my analysis confirms that 1002 of these units are lost (Orders from P1, P3, P10, P24, and P26 are all >= 14 periods overdue). This results in an 'effective' pipeline of 257 units (1259 - 1002). To ensure the OR backend (which ignores lost status) places orders when needed, I must inflate the base stock by the total amount of phantom inventory (1002 units). For forecasting, I am using a recent_N of 4 to capture the current low-demand regime of ~35-40 units/period (total mu_hat over L+1 periods approx 105-120). By setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired inventory levels plus the 1002 phantom units, I prevent the backend from being 'tricked' into under-ordering by the non-existent stock in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom inventory persists at 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26). Current demand regime (Nov) is significantly lower, averaging ~36 units/period (P38-P40). Logistics appear functional for recent orders with L=1-3, but the 1002 units are confirmed lost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256023 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a late-fall lower demand regime, averaging ~35 units/period over the last four periods (P38-P41). On-hand inventory is low (17 units), and the reported In-transit pipeline (1259 units) is heavily contaminated by 1002 units across five specifically identified lost/severely overdue orders (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26), all of which are \u226515 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2. The 'true' active pipeline is approximately 257 units (1259 - 1002). To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order despite the phantom 1002 units in its pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be inflated. Calculating mu_hat using recent demand (N=4, avg=35) gives a base of ~105 for (L+1=3). To offset the 1002 units of phantom stock, I will set an explicit mu_hat of 1107 (105 + 1002). This forces the backend to see a requirement that covers both real demand and the phantom inventory hole. Sigma_hat is set to default as recent volatility is low, and L is set to default (2) as recent arrivals (P33, P35) occurred within 1-3 periods, suggesting the immediate logistics chain is functional.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed phantom inventory persists at 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26). Current late-November demand regime is stable at ~35 units/period. The gap between reported In-transit and actual expected arrivals remains ~1000 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The demand regime has transitioned from a high summer peak (~110-130) to a significantly lower late-fall/winter regime, averaging ~40 units over the last 5 periods (P38-P42). The reported In-transit inventory is 1259 units, but historical evidence confirms 1002 of these units are lost (Orders from P1, P3, P10, P24, P26), leaving a 'real' pipeline of 257 units. To ensure the backend places necessary orders despite the inflated phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover both the current demand forecast and a compensatory volume for the lost stock. I estimate demand at ~40 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the required base stock is (1+L)*demand \u2248 120. To bypass the phantom pipeline of 1002 units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1122 (120 expected need + 1002 offset) to trigger any replenishment. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to achieve this specific offset and calculate for L to reflect recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime for December is confirmed lower, averaging ~40 units/period. Total phantom inventory remains 1002 units. Real pipeline is 257 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256023' is in a low-demand winter regime, with the average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) being approximately 41 units. Inventory is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The primary challenge continues to be the massive amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on historical data, orders from Periods 1, 3, 10, 24, and 26 (totaling 1002 units) are significantly overdue (L > 15) and are confirmed lost. The current In-transit reported is 1259; subtracting the 1002 lost units leaves a realistic pipeline of 257 units. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend (which uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders), the mu_hat parameter must be artificially inflated to exceed the phantom inventory plus the safety stock requirement. I am setting mu_hat to 1150 to account for ~750 units of phantom pipeline offset plus approximately 400 units to cover (L+1) demand and safety stock for the current period, ensuring an order is generated to recover from the stock-out.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-December. Demand has stabilized into a winter regime, with the last 7 periods (P38-P44) averaging approximately 39 units/period. The reported 'In-transit' of 1259 units is severely inflated by phantom inventory. Based on the history of non-arrivals, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1 (118), P3 (187), P10 (223), P24 (199), and P26 (275). This totals 1002 units of phantom stock. The backend OR logic subtracts the full 1259 'In-transit' from the base_stock calculation. To ensure a real-world order is placed when needed, mu_hat must be set to a value that covers expected demand across (L+1) periods PLUS an offset equal to the phantom inventory (1002 units). With L=2, the required real base stock for a 39-unit demand regime is approximately 117 units. To force this, mu_hat is set to (Real Base Stock + Phantom) = 117 + 1002 = 1119 units using the 'explicit' method. Although current on-hand is 0, this adjustment is necessary to prevent persistent stock-outs caused by the backend's focus on non-existent pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Total phantom inventory confirmed at 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26 are all >= 18 periods overdue). December demand regime confirmed stable at ~39 units/period. Logistics for fresh orders remain functional (L=1-2), but the backend pipeline remains contaminated, requiring a constant ~1000 unit offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late December. Demand has stabilized at a lower winter regime of ~35-40 units per period (P43-P45: 40, 32, 35). Total reported In-transit is 1259 units, but our carry-over analysis identifies 1002 units as 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26), which are all >= 20 periods overdue. The true functional pipeline is 1259 - 1002 = 257 units. Since On-hand is 0, we need to ensure the OR backend places an order. The base_stock calculation (mu_hat) must be inflated by the 1002 phantom units to bypass the backend's pipeline subtraction logic. Estimated weekly demand is 36. With L=2, required base_stock (3 periods of demand) is ~108 plus safety stock. To force an order when the backend sees 1259 in transit, the mu_hat needs to be set such that base_stock > 1259. I will use 'explicit' values to target a total base stock that accounts for both real demand and the phantom offset.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Total phantom inventory updated to 1002 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26) with no arrivals from these for >20 periods. Winter demand regime confirmed stable at ~35-40 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable winter demand regime (December) with an average of ~34 units per period (P43-P46). On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 1259 units, but 1002 of these are confirmed phantom inventory from lost/extremely overdue orders (P1, P3, P10, P24, P26 - all now >20 periods overdue, whereas promised lead time is 2). This leaves a real pipeline of approximately 257 units. To ensure the OR backend (which sees 1259 in-transit) triggers a replenishment order to cover the (L+1) horizon, mu_hat must be set to compensate for the 1002 units of phantom stock. Target base stock should be (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock + Phantom Offset. With L=2 and Demand=34, (3*34) + safety_stock + 1002 \u2248 1150. By using an explicit mu_hat that incorporates this offset, we force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'full' pipeline it perceives.
