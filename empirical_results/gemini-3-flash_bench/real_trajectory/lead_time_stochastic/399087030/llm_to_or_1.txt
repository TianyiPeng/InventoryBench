Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11) for SKU 399087030 (Ladies Super Skinny Denim). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Available demand samples show: 110, 102, 105, 123, 115. These five samples average 111 units per week with a standard deviation of approximately 8.57. Since there is no on-hand inventory and no in-transit orders, we must immediately establish a base stock levels. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the base demand mean and volatility. This translates to \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L) * mean \u2248 3 * 111 = 333 and \u03c3\u0302 = sqrt(1+L) * std \u2248 1.73 * 8.57 \u2248 14.8. The backend will calculate these based on the provided N. No significant pattern shifts have occurred yet as this is the first decision period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a pair of ladies' super-skinny denim jeans. Looking at the historical demand samples (ending 2019-02-04) and the observed demand in Period 1 (130 units), the demand appears relatively stable with a slight upward trend or higher baseline than the initial samples (mean of samples approx 111, P1 demand 130). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 125 units in-transit (ordered in P1). The promised lead time is 2, so this shipment is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4. To bridge the gap and avoid future stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit forecast. Forecasted weekly demand is ~125. With L=2, the backend computes for (L+1)=3 periods. Thus, mu_hat = 3 * 125 = 375. Sigma is estimated based on the historical volatility (~8 per week), so sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 8 \u2248 14. This aggressive stock-up is necessary because we already missed the demand in Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows values: 110, 102, 105, 123, 115 (pre-game) followed by 130 and 73 in Periods 1 and 2. The mean demand is approximately 108.3. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (125 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (2+1=3) and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived yet, resulting in lost sales in P1 and P2. The high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) justifies maintaining a high service level. The recent drop to 73 demand in P2 appears to be a fluctuation rather than a regime shift, so I will use a recent_N approach to capture the 5 pre-game samples plus the 2 in-game samples (N=7) to stabilize the forecast against the P2 outlier while remaining responsive.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-04 (Period 4). The item is a staple 'Ladies Denim' (super-skinny jeans). We have observed 3 periods of demand (130, 73, 79) in addition to 5 historical samples provided (110, 102, 105, 123, 115). Starting on-hand was 0, resulting in significant lost sales in Periods 1-3. The promised lead time is 2. Following the logic in Scenario A: an order placed in P1 arrives DURING P3 resolution and is visible at P4 START. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the P1 shipment is delayed. Since we have zero on-hand and 378 units in-transit (P1: 125, P2: 139, P3: 114), we must ensure the OR backend continues to account for the pipeline while preparing for arrival. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (3 game samples + 5 historical) to capture the trend, but I will explicitly set L=3 based on the confirmed delay of the P1 order which should have arrived by the P3 conclusion if L=2.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is Ladies Denim trousers. Historical demand data provided (Jan-Feb) shows an average of 111. Recent game history (Periods 1-4) shows demand of 130, 73, 79, and 82 (average ~91 in-game). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Only one order has concluded so far: the P2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time = 2). The P1 order (125 units) is now overdue (it should have arrived in P3), and the P3 order (114 units) should have arrived in P4. Since P1 has not arrived by P5 start, it and potentially subsequent orders are delayed or lost. Total in-transit is 346. I will stick to the promised lead time of 2 (L=2) for calculations but use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the slightly lower in-game demand levels (avg ~91) compared to the pre-game samples (avg 111), providing a buffer for potential lost shipments while avoiding over-stocking if the overdue units suddenly arrive.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Ladies Denim Super-Skinny Jeans'. Demand history shows an average around 102 units/period (Historical mean 110, Recent mean P1-P5 is 91). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 346 units. Let's analyze lead times: Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (LT=2). Period 1's order (125 units) is significantly overdue (ordered P1, expected P3, now P6) and is likely lost. Period 3's order (114 units) should have arrived in Period 5 but is missing; however, it's only one period late, so it might arrive in Period 6. Period 4's order (107 units) is expected in Period 6. Since on-hand is 0 and we have a stockout, we need to ensure the OR engine targets enough base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Using the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to account for historical data, and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slightly lower recent sales volume compared to the initial historical samples. I will set N=5 to encompass the full observed period range.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is ladies' skinny jeans. Historically, demand has averaged around 95 units per week across 11 samples (110, 102, 105, 123, 115, 130, 73, 79, 82, 91, 75). Recent demand (last 6 periods) has stabilized lower at ~88 units. On-hand inventory is CURRENTLY 0 due to an 'out of stock' situation in Period 6. Looking at history: Order P1 (125 units) is MISSING (promised lead time 2, now P7). Order P2 arrived in P4 (lead time 2). Order P3 (114 units) was placed in P3, should have arrived in P5, but has not arrived in P6 or P4 conclude messages, suggesting it might be delayed or lost. Order P4 (107 units) should arrive in P6, but P6 conclude shows arrived=0. Total in-transit is 346 (125+114+107). Because arrivals are highly unreliable or significantly delayed, I will use lead time L=3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival failures and ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 6 periods of historical data (N=6) which reflects post-initial-launch stability better than the high early samples. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment for Period 1 (125 units) and Period 3 (114 units) are significantly delayed or lost; actual lead time is likely > 2 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The current demand context shows a major spike in Period 7 (211 units), likely due to a seasonal peak (potentially pre-Easter or spring shopping). Historical data from Jan-Feb averaged ~110, while recent weeks averaged ~80 until the spike. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 1 (125 units) and Period 3 (114 units) are definitively lost or extremely delayed, as they are past their 2-period lead time and have not appeared in 'conclude' messages. Only Period 2's order arrived on time. On-hand inventory is 0, with 424 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P7). Since P1 and P3 are likely lost, 'effective' pipeline is likely only P4 (107) and P7 (78). To protect against the demand spike and supply unreliability, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for potential delays, and using an explicit mu_hat of 520 (calculated as (1+3) * 130) to bridge the gap between 2019-01 highs and the recent outlier, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: Orders from Period 1 (125 units) and Period 3 (114 units) are confirmed lost/missing as of Period 8.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observed a demand spike of 211 (followed by a return to 88), which aligns with the transition into Spring (April). More critically, the order from Period 7 arrived in just 1 period (lead time = 1), whereas orders from Periods 1 and 3 are officially lost. The current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 572 units, which primarily consists of the large order from Period 8 (226 units) and the missing/dead orders. Since our on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a history of lost shipments, I will set L to 1 (based on the most recent arrival) to trigger the OR engine to order for the immediate upcoming demand, while setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the seasonal transition visible in the late March/early April data (averaging ~120 recently). sigma_hat is set to recent_N to capture the recent high volatility caused by the 211 demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability identified: Period 7 order arrived in 1 period, while Period 1 and 3 remain lost. Recent demand shows high volatility (std dev increase) entering April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The item is a 'Super Skinny' denim jeans product. Looking at the history, shipments from Period 1 and Period 3 are definitively lost. Lead times are unstable: P2 order arrived in 2 periods, but P7 arrived in 1 period. Current demand is volatile; we saw a massive spike in P7 (211 units) but then a drop. Total pipeline is 572 units (likely including orders from P4, P8, and others not yet concluded). On-hand is 0. Since we are entering mid-April, demand patterns for denim typically stabilize after early spring surges. I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture this recent high-volatility regime. I'll set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering during period of supply instability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

We are at Period 11 (2019/04/22). The SKU is ladies' denim trousers. Historical demand data shows a spike in Period 7 (211 units), but recent demand in April (Periods 8-10) has been lower (88, 57, 41) though volatile. The orders from Period 1 (125 units) and Period 3 (114 units) are definitively lost as they are now 10 and 8 periods overdue respectively against a promised lead time of 2. Recent successful arrivals show lead times of 1 (Period 7 order) and 2 (Period 8 order), suggesting the supply chain has stabilized near the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is 185, and there is no manageable in-transit pipeline (the '346 units' in-transit in the system likely includes the 239 lost units plus the Period 4 order of 107 which never showed a 'conclude' message). To calculate mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the volatility of the spring season (March-April) while dampening the extreme spike of P7. I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals align with this.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered: P7 and P8 orders arrived with lead times of 1 and 2 respectively. P1, P3, and P4 orders (total 346 units) are confirmed lost/undeliverable.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), the SKU (Ladies Denim Trousers) is entering late spring/early summer. Historical demand analysis shows high volatility and stockout events (P1-P3, P7, P9). Demand over the last 5 active periods (P7-P11) averaged 100.4 units, with a notable spike of 211 in P7. On-hand inventory is 80 units. In-transit shows 346 units, but carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (125), P3 (114), and P4 (107) are lost (totaling 346). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. The system needs a new order to meet (L+1) demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent volume trends while ignoring the early-year lost shipment periods. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods for recent successful arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019/05/06). Reviewing history, shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 346 units) are lost. Recent successful arrivals show lead times of 1 and 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized near the promised lead time of 2. Historical demand from the start of the simulation through current data shows a mean of approximately 85 units per period (excluding the outlier peak of 211 in Period 7). Recent demand (Periods 10-12) has been 41, 105, and 56, averaging 67.3. Given the product is 'Ladies Denim Super Skinny Jeans', demand in May should be relatively stable. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level which is slightly lower than the long-term average, while setting L to 2 (promised) as the recent deliveries (P7 and P8) arrived within 1-2 periods. This approach maintains sufficient inventory without over-ordering after the P1, P3, P4 losses caused stockouts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14 (2019/5/13). Historically, orders from Period 1, 3, and 4 (total 346 units) were lost, causing stockouts. Recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods (P7 = 1, P8 = 2). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'Ladies Denim Trousers' shows a downward trend after a peak in March (211 units), with recent weeks averaging around 50-60 units (P12=56, P13=49). The current in-transit inventory is 412 units, which consists of the Order from P2 (139 - arrived), P7 (78 - arrived), P8 (226 - arrived), and the recent order from P12 (66). However, the 'In-transit' metric of 412 includes the old lost shipments (125+114+107 = 346). Actual viable pipeline = 412 (reported) - 346 (lost) = 66 units (from P12). Because the on-hand is 0 and pipeline is low relative to the 3-period coverage needed (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime (~64 avg), and 'calculate' for lead time since recent arrivals (P7, P8) have returned to the promised range.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), we are currently out of stock. Historical demand samples (including the seed data) show a mean of ~102 units/period, but recently (Periods 12-14), demand has stabilized at a lower average of ~58 units. We are using current date context (post-spring peaks) to adjust expectations. Deliveries from Periods 2, 7, 8, and 12 have arrived with lead times of 2, 1, 2, and 2 periods respectively, confirming the promised lead time of 2 is generally reliable despite earlier losses. The 'In-transit' quantity of 346 consists entirely of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which were confirmed lost in Period 11. However, the backend OR OR controller counts all units in 'In-transit' against our target base stock. Since those 346 units will never arrive, the OR engine will refuse to order any new stock unless we set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. To force an order that covers our actual needs (approx. 240 units for L+1 periods) while overcoming the 346-unit 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 650. This accounts for the ~240 units we actually need plus the ~346 ghost units that are blocking the calculation.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16 (May 27, 2019). The SKU is ladies' denim, which tends to have relatively stable but occasionally volatile demand. On-hand inventory is 0. History indicates that orders from P1, P3, and P4 were lost, causing inventory stockouts. However, recent deliveries (P7, P8, P12) have arrived with lead times of 1 or 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized at the promised 2-period lead time. Recent demand (P10-P15) has averaged 60.5 units per period, showing a significant decrease from the earlier periods (P1-P9 mean was ~101). To avoid over-ordering while ensuring we cover the 3-period risk window (L+1), I will use the most recent 6 periods to forecast demand (P10-P15). The lead time parameter is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed performance (1-2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: Average weekly demand decreased from ~101 to ~61 (-40%) following the volatile March/April period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (2019/6/3). Reviewing history, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 10, with mean weekly demand dropping from ~100 to ~61. The recent demand samples (P12-P16: 56, 49, 71, 41, 22) show a further decline, averaging 47.8. Lead times have stabilized back to the promised 2 periods (observed lead times for P7, P8, P12 were 1, 2, 2 respectively). The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 605 units in-transit (reflecting a large order of 259 units in P15). This pipeline (605 units) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 3 weeks (~150-180 units based on the current regime), meaning the OR backend will likely not place a new order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining some volatility coverage, and 'calculate' for lead time since the instability of the early periods has resolved.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), we are managing a demand regime for ladies' skinny jeans that shifted significantly around Period 10. The average demand post-Period 9 has stabilized around 58 units per week (min 20, max 105), down from the ~100-110 units seen earlier in the year. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 15 order in Period 17. Current inventory is high: 239 units on-hand and 346 in-transit (though the in-transit figure includes 346 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost and will never arrive). Since the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation incorrectly includes these lost units, it would likely under-order if we used default parameters. However, our current on-hand inventory of 239 units already covers approximately 4 weeks of demand at the current rate (58 units/week). With L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~174 units). Since 239 > 174, the most profitable action is to allow on-hand inventory to deplete to reduce holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the lower demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation reflects current reality.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19 (mid-June). Historical patterns show a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 10 (mid-April), where demand dropped from an average of ~101 to ~61. However, the most recent 5 periods (Periods 14-18) show an even lower average demand of approximately 39.8 units per week (71, 41, 22, 20, 45). The current on-hand inventory is 194 units, which is quite high relative to this recent demand. There are 346 units in-transit, but these appear to be primarily from the confirmed lost shipments in early periods (P1, P3, P4) or are otherwise delayed, as the OR backend's pipeline tracking doesn't automatically clear identified losses. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current lower volume regime and avoid over-ordering, given the substantial on-hand stock. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the recent reduced volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (2 periods) as recent successful deliveries (P12, P15) arrived within that window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further stabilized at a lower level: avg demand for P14-P18 is ~40 units/week, down from the previous ~61 average.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Super Skinny Low-Rise Jeans' has shifted significantly from an initial average of ~101 (P1-P9) to ~61 (P10-P13) and finally to ~40 (P14-P19) as we move into summer (late June). The last 3 periods show demand of 22, 20, 45, and 19 units, supporting the most recent regime of ~40 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 175 units, which covers approximately 4.3 periods of demand at the current rate (40 units/week). With a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3), the required base stock is roughly 3 * 40 = 120 units. Since on-hand (175) exceeds this requirement and total pipeline inventory (including lost units) is 346, the OR engine will correctly calculate a zero order. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default lead time (2) as the supply chain has stabilized since Period 11.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand analysis shows a significant and sustained downward shift starting around Period 14. Average demand for the last seven periods (P14-P20) is ~33 units/week, down from the previous regime of ~61. The most recent three periods (P18-P20) show even lower demand averaging ~25. Given the high inventory on hand (163 units) relative to this new demand level, and considering the promised lead time of 2 periods, the current stock is sufficient to cover over 6 weeks of demand. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods. To avoid further accumulation of holding costs for this 'Ladies Denim' product (which may be entering a post-peak seasonal decline in July), I will set the demand parameters to reflect the most recent regime (N=7) and use the calculate method for lead time to capture the recent stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further decreased: P14-P20 average demand is ~33 units/week, down from previous ~61. High on-hand inventory relative to lower summer demand levels.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand for this SKU (super-skinny low-rise jeans) has significantly shifted downward since May. Over the last 8 periods (P14-P21), demand has averaged approximately 31.75 units per week (71, 41, 22, 20, 45, 19, 12, 24). This is a stark contrast to the early 2019 levels (>100 units). On-hand inventory is currently 139 units, which covers roughly 4.4 periods of forward demand at current rates. Given the lead time is 2 periods, we are currently overstocked. The 'In-transit' figure of 346 appears to be accounting for the lost orders from P1, P3, and P4 (125+114+107=346), which were flagged as lost in previous insights and should be ignored for replenishment planning. I will set the demand forecast using the most recent 8 periods to reflect the sustained low summer demand regime. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the high on-hand relative to the low demand mean.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' super-skinny jeans. Historical data and recent demand samples show a significant decrease in demand as we move into the peak summer period, likely due to a seasonal shift away from heavy denim in favor of lighter clothing. Specifically, since Period 19, weekly demand has plummeted to an average of ~16.7 units (19, 12, 24, 12). Current on-hand inventory is 127 units, which is enough to cover over 7 weeks of current demand levels. The in-transit figure of 346 units refers to the long-lost orders from P1, P3, and P4 (125+114+107=346), which are confirmed undeliverable but still appear in the pipeline inventory due to the engine logic. To prevent unnecessary ordering while carrying high stock, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the summer low. The lead time is stable at 2 periods (based on the last successful arrivals in P14 and P17). No new order should be triggered by the OR backend given the high on-hand stock and low demand forecast.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' super-skinny low-rise jeans. Demand has significantly decreased and stabilized at a much lower level during the summer months (June and July). Specifically, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is approximately 15.8 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 115 units, which is sufficient to cover over 7 weeks of current demand. Additionally, while the 'In-transit' column shows 346 units, these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 and should be ignored for planning. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low current demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 10 periods (which covers the shift to the ~15-30 units/week range) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this lower seasonal demand and prevents unnecessary ordering while we bleed off the current 115 units of stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (late June - July): average demand decreased to approximately 16 units/week, down from ~33 in early June.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. The product is ladies super-skinny denim jeans. We are in a verified low-demand summer regime. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has been 24, 12, 12, and 10 units respectively, averaging ~14.5 units/week. This aligns with the 'Summer demand regime' identified in previous carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is at 105 units, which is approximately 7 weeks of supply at current demand levels. There are also 346 units 'in-transit', although carry-over insights from Period 11 suggest that 346 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/undeliverable. However, even excluding the lost units, the on-hand inventory is significantly higher than the required base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (approx 3 weeks of protection). To prevent further accumulation of inventory and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods of data (N=4) to capture the current low-demand floor accurately. This will likely result in a zero order as pipeline/on-hand inventory far exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 5th, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' super-skinny jeans. Historical demand shows a significant decline throughout the summer, with the most recent regime (P22-P25) averaging approximately 13.5 units per week. This is a sharp reduction from the spring peaks. We currently have 85 units on-hand, which at the current burn rate covers more than 6 periods of demand, while the promised lead time is only 2 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 346 units refers to the previously identified lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) which have not arrived for many periods; these are ignored for decision-making as per the carry-over insights. Given the excess inventory relative to current low demand, no new orders are needed. I am setting L to default (2), mu_hat to an explicit value (3 periods * 13.5 units/period = 40.5) to reflect the recent summer demand floor, and sigma_hat to a low explicit value to prevent unnecessary safety stock orders while we work through the surplus on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (2019/8/12). Historical analysis confirms a significant seasonal demand decline for this SKU ('Super Skinny Ladies Denim'), which entered a 'summer trough' around Period 24 (late July). Over the last three periods (P24-P26), demand has averaged approximately 21.6 units/week (10, 20, 35), with a slight uptick in the most recent period suggesting a potential slow return from the summer low, though it remains far below spring levels (~100+). Current on-hand inventory is 50 units. With an average demand of ~22 units and a promised lead time of 2 periods, the relevant (L+1) demand window is 3 periods, totaling ~66 units. Given we have 50 units on hand and 346 units permanently stuck in-transit (lost orders from P1, P3, P4), the backend's capped policy will see on-hand + in-transit (396) as being far above the base stock, resulting in 0 units ordered. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (last 4 periods, P23-P26: 12, 10, 20, 35) to ensure the OR engine has an accurate forecast of the current low-demand environment, even though no new order will be triggered due to the 'pipeline' ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Mid-August demand confirms a slight recovery from July troughs (avg ~22 units/week over P24-P26 vs ~13 units/week over P22-P24).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand for the 'Ladies Denim' product has shown a slight recovery in August (P25-P27 avg: 29) compared to the July low (P22-P24 avg: 11), likely as shoppers anticipate the transition into autumn. Historical data from early 2019 (Jan/Feb) suggests baseline demand is significantly higher (~100/week) than current summer levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 346 persists because orders from P1, P3, and P4 were confirmed lost/undeliverable; these units are factored into the OR engine's pipeline calculations, which prevents it from ordering. Since on-hand inventory is now low (18 units) and demand is rising, I must use 'explicit' parameters to ignore the 'phantom' pipeline and ensure stock is replenished for the late August/Sept recovery. I set mu_hat to 90 (3 periods * 30 forecast) and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand recovery confirmed: Average demand for P25-P27 is ~29 units/week, up from the July trough of ~11 units/week (+160%).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is August 26, 2019. We are exiting the July/early-August summer low demand period. Recent history (P25-P28) shows a demand recovery with samples of 20, 35, 32, and 27 (average ~28.5 units/week), a significant increase from the July trough of ~12 units/week. My on-hand inventory is now 0 after Period 28's demand exhausted the remaining stock. Regarding the in-transit inventory of 346 units: this figure includes the lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (125+114+107=346). These orders are confirmed lost in carry-over insights and will never arrive, but they persist in the pipeline calculation. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. To trigger a necessary order to meet the rising late-August/September demand, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 'ghost' inventory of 346. Since the OR engine calculates order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline is 346, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550. This value accounts for (L+1) weeks of demand (approx 3 * 30 = 90) plus the 346 unit offset. Setting L=2 (promised) and sigma_hat explicitly at 50 to maintain a healthy safety stock during this recovery period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Historically, this SKU (denim jeans) shows a seasonal trough in July, followed by a steady recovery in August. Demand in Period 29 was 21 units. However, we are moving into the fall season (back-to-school/September), where demand for long pants/denim typically increases significantly. The demand samples from January/February (P1-P5) were around 100+ units per week. While recent August demand averaged ~26 units (P26-P29), I expect a seasonal uptick. I ordered 231 units in Period 29 which are in-transit (expected in P31 or P32). On-hand is currently 0. Given the move into September, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current upward trend but keep N small to react quickly to the expected seasonal spike. I will maintain L=default (2) as recent arrivals have been stable at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery beginning: August saw a shift from ~11 units (July trough) to ~26 units. Anticipating further increases as seasonal demand for denim historically peaks in fall/winter (P1-P5 data supports ~100+ units/week).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the fall season (mid-September), which is historically a peak period for denim demand. The initial data (Jan/Feb 2019) showed demand levels consistently above 100 units/week, while July saw a trough as low as 10-12 units. Recent demand has stabilized into a recovery phase: August averaged ~26 units (P26-P30), but we expect a significant seasonal uptick as cooler weather begins. Current on-hand inventory is 0. An order of 231 units was placed in P29 and is expected in P31 (current period resolution), meaning it will be visible at the start of P32. There is a total of 577 units in-transit (P29 order + potential historical lost units still technically 'in-transit' but likely write-offs; however, the P29 order is the primary focus). To prepare for the late-September/October peak similar to February levels (avg 100+), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent recovery trend, but I will monitor for a sharp jump next period which would necessitate 'explicit' forecasting to match the ~100 units/week seen in Q1. L=2 is standard and has been reliable recently.

Recent demand has trended upward from a July trough (~11) to the current level (~50 in Period 31). Entering the peak fall season, I anticipate demand will return to the ~100 units/week range seen in the early year cycles. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 577 units in-transit (orders from P29 and likely hidden logic covering previous periods mentioned in 'In-transit'). Since P29's order (231 units) should arrive during Period 31 or 32 (given L=2), and on-hand is zero, we need to ensure the pipeline is sufficient for the high-demand season. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to reflect the expected seasonal return to ~100 units/week (Total = (1+L)*100 = 300) and use a higher sigma to account for the pivot from low summer demand to high fall demand.

Carry-over insight: September demand recovery confirmed: P31 demand reached 50 units, following a steady climb from July (avg ~11). Entering historical peak season (based on P1-P5 data ~100+ units/week).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019). The demand for denim is clearly recovering from the July trough (~11 units) and following an upward seasonal trajectory: 32 (P30), 50 (P31), and 60 (P32). Historical data from Jan/Feb (P1-P5) shows demand levels typically exceed 100 units/week during peak season. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 577 units (including 231 ordered at P29). Since the promised lead time is 2, the P29 order should arrive during Period 31 and be visible in Period 32 conclude. However, P32 conclude shows 0 arrivals. This means the supply chain is experiencing significant delays again or the shipment is lost, similar to the instability seen in March/April. Despite the high In-transit number, the lack of physical arrival necessitates a strategy that assumes the pipeline is unreliable. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 300 to reflect the 3-period demand (L+1) at the current growth rate (~100/week) and use 'calculate' for L to account for the increasing actual lead times observed. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of the recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain delay/instability re-emerged at Period 32: Order from Period 29 (231 units) has not arrived within promised 2 periods. Demand recovery continues: P30-P32 average (47 units) is 327% higher than July trough.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sept 30, 2019. We are in a significant seasonal demand surge for denim trousers. Demand in P33 jumped to 169 units, aligning with early year levels (P1-P5) and confirming the end of the summer trough. The order from P29 (231 units) is now 2 periods overdue (5 periods since order, promised 2), which strongly suggests it is lost or severely delayed, consistent with historical supply chain instability (P1, P3, P4 were lost). Current on-hand is 0, and we have incurred stockouts since P29. While 577 units are technically 'in-transit', the 231 units from P29 are likely ghost inventory. I must set parameters to trigger a large enough order to cover the (L+1) demand window at the new higher regime, while considering that the OR backend's inventory check (on-hand + pipeline) might be overestimating usable stock. Based on the jump from 60 to 169, I'll use a recent 3-period average for demand to capture the sharp upward trend without being overly skewed by the summer lows. I will maintain L=2 as the 'promised' lead time but effectively assume P29 is lost.

Carry-over insight: P33 confirms a sharp seasonal demand spike to 169 units, matching Feb/March levels (~100-130). P29 order (231 units) is now 5 periods since ordering (3 periods overdue), matching the 'lost order' pattern observed earlier in the year.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 starts with zero on-hand inventory and a confirmed seasonal demand spike (Period 33: 169, Period 34: 152). This aligns with the historical peak seen in the early training data (Period 1-4). However, the order from Period 29 (231 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it is lost, following the pattern from Period 1 and Period 3. Currently, the in-transit amount is 577 (composed of the likely lost P29 order of 231 units and newer potentially delayed orders). Because the OR backend computes 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline includes these likely 'lost' units, the system will under-order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 480, which reflects 3 periods (L+1=3) of the current high-demand regime (~160 units/week). L is kept at 2, but I am monitoring for continued delays as the lead time variability has returned.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Seasonal demand peak confirmed (Avg demand P33-P34 = 160 vs July trough of 11). Order from Period 29 (231 units) is confirmed 'lost' after 5 periods of no arrival, matching previous supply chain failure patterns.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-October period, which historically corresponds to high demand for denim (based on P1-P5 data showing demand >100 units/week). The recent data confirms this seasonal spike: demand for P33-P35 has averaged 152.6 units/week. However, we have a significant supply chain issue. The order from Period 29 (231 units) is now 6 periods since ordering and has not arrived; following the patterns from P1, P3, and P4, this shipment is likely lost. Our on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline only contains the 'lost' 231 units and any hypothetical orders placed in P30-P35 (though the history shows ordered=0 for those periods). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficiently large order to cover high seasonal demand plus the lead time (L=2) while ignoring the lost pipeline inventory, I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 459 (representing a forecast of 153 units/week * (2+1) periods). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high volatility of the seasonal peak. This setup forces the base stock to rise enough to clear out the effective zero-inventory state.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-October period, which is part of the high-demand seasonal peak for denim trousers (matching early Q1 data where demand was ~100+ units). Demand over the last four weeks (P33-P36) has been 169, 152, 137, and 98, averaging 139 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. There are 577 units in-transit, but the order from Period 29 (231 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost (matching the pattern from P1 and P3). Subsequent orders are now within their promised lead time windows. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the current high-demand regime of ~135 units/week. Since we need to cover demand during the lead time (2) plus the current period (1), I will use (1+L) * 135 = 405. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during this autumn spike. L is set to default as recent non-lost deliveries moved in 1-2 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late October (2019/10/28), deep in the peak season for denim. Demand over the last five periods (P33-P37) has been consistently high, averaging ~140 units/week (169, 152, 137, 98, 143). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline of 577 units likely includes orders placed during the high demand phase that haven't arrived yet. The order from P29 (231 units) is definitively lost based on the pattern established in the Carry-over Insights (5+ periods without arrival). Subtracting this lost order from the pipeline (577 - 231) leaves ~346 units actually in transit. To maintain availability for high seasonal demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current weekly mean of ~140. For L, I use 'default' (2) as recent successfully arrived shipments (P7, P8, P12, P15) showed lead times of 1-2 periods, despite occasional catastrophic losses of entire shipments. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current high-demand regime ensures the OR engine targets a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) window (3 weeks of ~140 units/week).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak seasonal demand period for 'Ladies Denim Trousers' (Nov/Dec). Historical data (P1-P5) and recent observations (P33-P38) show a sustained demand regime averaging approximately 140 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The supply chain has shown extreme instability: the order from Period 29 (231 units) is now 10 periods past its order date and is definitively lost, consistent with earlier patterns. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure is misleading as it likely includes these lost units. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1) of peak demand (140 * 3 = 420) to ensure the OR engine triggers a substantial order to refill the empty pipeline and satisfy the current high demand. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility seen in peak seasons.

Carry-over insight: Second supply chain failure confirmed: Period 29 order (231 units) lost after 10 periods of no arrival. Total lost units in 2019 now approximately 577 units (P1, P3, P4, P29). Demand regime in Oct/Nov is confirmed at ~140 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 40 (mid-November). Historical data from Period 1-5 and recent activity since Period 33 confirm that we are in the peak demand season for ladies' denim. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P33-P39) is approximately 137 units/week, with fluctuations between 98 and 169 units. The replenishment situation is critical: we have 0 on-hand inventory and the 'in-transit' units (577) consist entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P29). Since the pipeline is effectively empty, we must trigger a large order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~137/week) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in this category. For lead time, I will stick to 'default' (2 periods) as there is no evidence that the shipments that DO arrive are taking longer than 2 periods; rather, shipments are either on time or completely disappeared.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed peak season demand regime (Nov-Dec): Weekly demand average is approximately 140 units (P33-P39), matching the early year peak (~100-130). All current 'In-Transit' units (577) are confirmed lost/undeliverable.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-November peak season for ladies' denim. Historical data from early year (P1-P5) and Recent Data (P33-P40) confirmed a high-demand regime averaging ~130 units/week. Since Period 29, no inventory has arrived, and the 577 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost/undeliverable based on the history of supply chain failures for this SKU. As on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is effectively zero (due to losses), a significant order is required to capture the remaining late-year demand. I will set the lead time to its promised 2 periods (as recent valid arrivals P7 and P8 followed L=1 or 2) and target a mu_hat based on the recent peak demand average (~130 units/week). Since we need to cover L+1 periods (3 weeks), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime of ~130 units/week * 3 = 390. This will ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order that ignores the 'ghost' in-transit units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late November peak demand season for ladies' denim. Historical demand from February (P1-P5) and the recent October/November surge (P33-P41) confirm a high-demand regime averaging approx 125 units/week. However, the inventory situation is critical: the on-hand inventory is 0, and the entire 'In-transit' balance of 577 units is confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, and P29). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, it will not place a new order if it believes these 577 units are still coming. To force the backend to ignore these ghost units and place a fresh order, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock calculation is (Profit / (Profit + Holding)) = 19/20 = 0.95 service level. For a mean of ~125 and L=2, base stock should be roughly (1+2)*125 + z*sigma. Using explicit mu_hat = 1000 serves as a proxy to trigger a maximum capacity order (the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend) to replenish the empty shelf immediately while overcoming the 577-unit 'In-transit' anchor.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Inventory replenishment strategy initiated to bypass 577 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P29) still showing as 'In-Transit'. Maintaining peak season demand forecast of ~125 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (early December), the heart of the peak season for denim. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 215, confirming strong holiday-season interest. Our on-hand inventory is 0. While 'In-transit' shows 968 units, historical analysis confirms that 577 of these (from P1, P3, P4, and P29) are almost certainly lost. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 391 units from the P42 order, which is expected to arrive in P44/P45. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period, I'm setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 375 (representing (1+L) * ~125 units/week) and choosing an explicit sigma_hat of 100 to handle the observed holiday volatility (P42 demand was 215). This forces the OR engine to place an additional order now to bridge the gap created by the lost historical inventory and the high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed holiday demand spike (P42 demand = 215). Re-adjusting safety stock to account for high demand variance during the December peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the final stretch of the holiday peak season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 215, while Period 43 settled at 82. The average for the current peak regime (P33-P43) is approximately 128 units/week, consistent with the early-year peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 968 units, but 577 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 29) are confirmed lost/undeliverable based on carry-over insights. This leaves effectively 391 units (ordered in P42) in the pipeline. These 391 units are expected to arrive in Period 44 or 45 (L=2). To ensure we cover demand for the remaining periods (reaching Period 47), which include potential late-holiday surges, I will maintain the mu_hat at 128 units per week. Setting L=2 (promised) as recent shipments (P7, P8, P12, P15) showed normalized lead times before the P29 loss. mu_hat is set to (1+2)*128 = 384. This will trigger the OR backend to maintain 384 units of effective inventory (on-hand + valid pipeline). Since valid pipeline is 391, this should stop further ordering unless demand exceeds expectations, preventing overstocking as we approach the game end (P47).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), representing the peak of the holiday shopping season for denim. Demand has been high, with a significant spike to 215 in Period 42. Recent demand (P42-P44) has averaged 116 units, though P44 dropped to 53. The supply chain has been highly unreliable: 577 units (P1, P3, P4, P29) are confirmed lost. In Period 42, we placed a large replenishment order of 391 units specifically to bypass these losses. Lead time is promised at 2 periods, meaning the P42 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 44 and become visible/available for sale at the start of Period 45. However, current observation shows 'On-hand: 0', suggesting either a delay in arrival (L=3 scenario) or that the system update is pending. Given 'In-transit: 968' (391 from P42 + 577 lost units), we must treat the 577 as permanent losses that the OR backend incorrectly counts as available pipeline. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 360 (representing 3 periods of ~120 demand) and use a high sigma_hat (80) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock high enough to trigger an order if the P42 shipment is also lost or to cover the holiday tail if it survives. Since we only have 3 periods left (45, 46, 47), we need to ensure enough inventory is on hand to conclude the game without excessive holding costs, but primarily focusing on not losing more holiday sales.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). Reviewing the history, the holiday peak occurred around P42 (demand=215). Following that, demand has cooled significantly (P43=82, P44=53, P45=59). The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~65 units. The shipment from P42 arrived in P45 (lead time = 3 periods), providing us with 332 units on-hand. The 577 units in-transit are confirmed lost from previous failures (P1, P3, P4, P29) and should be ignored for replenishment logic. Given we are post-peak and entering late December/January, historical data from P1-P5 (Feb) suggests demand eventually returns to ~100+, but the immediate trend is downward from the Dec spike. With 332 units on-hand and an expected weekly demand of ~65-75, we have roughly 4-5 weeks of stock. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the post-peak cooling trend (average ~102 but weighted by the recent 50s and 80s). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the recently observed drift to 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed: Demand dropped from a peak of 215 (P42) to an average of ~65 units/week in P43-P45. Lead time for the most recent successful delivery (P42 order) was 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the end of the calendar year (Period 47, Dec 30). Historical demand from Period 1-3 (early Feb) suggests a return to a higher demand regime of ~100+ units as we cycle into the new year. Recent post-holiday demand (P43-P46) has cooled to an average of ~58 units per week. The 577 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (from P1, P3, P4, P29) and will never arrive, so the current on-hand of 295 is the only usable inventory. At the current cooling rate, 295 units cover approximately 5 periods of demand, but we should prepare for the early-year spike. The last successful delivery (P42) had a lead time of 3 periods, so I will set L to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the post-holiday cooling trend (~58/week) while the safety stock (sigma) will handle the potential transition back to higher Feb levels. The OR backend will see 295 on hand against a pipeline offset by the 'lost' 577 and likely not order yet, which is appropriate given the current stock level and slowing demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand cooling confirmed: P43-P46 average demand has dropped to ~58 units/week. Lead time remains volatile but recently observed at 3 periods (P42 order).
