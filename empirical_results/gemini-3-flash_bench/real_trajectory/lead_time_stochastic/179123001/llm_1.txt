Historical demand from the provided samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 103.4 units/week (range: 85-113). Since this is Period 1, starting inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts during the lead time and the current period (L+1 = 3 periods of demand coverage), I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3.

  "rationale": "a) World Knowledge & Product Description: These are women's basic jersey leggings. As an everyday basic item, demand is usually relatively stable but can be influenced by the turn of the season. 2019/2/18 is mid-February; we are approaching spring in many regions, which often maintains steady demand for layering basics.\n\nb) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) were [113, 101, 106, 85, 112], averaging ~103 units. Period 1 actual demand was 125, which is slightly higher than the average but within a reasonable variance range (~20% increase). I will forecast a baseline of ~115 units per period to account for recent momentum.\n\nc) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. The Period 1 order (320 units) is in-transit. Based on 'Lead Time = 2', an order placed in P1 arrives during P3 and is visible in the P4 decision phase. Current in-transit = 320.\n\nd) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: \n- Target Coverage: (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (P2, P3, P4).\n- Needed Total: 115 * 3 = 345 units.\n- Current Pipeline: On-hand (0) + In-transit (320) = 320 units.\n- This leaves a gap of 25 units. While it's early in the game, the P1 demand (125) was higher than historical samples (avg ~103). If P1's 125 represents a new level, needed total for 3 periods is 375. \n\ne) Final Order Logic: To bridge the gap between existing in-transit (320) and the projected needs for the next three periods (approx 345-375), and to rebuild safety stock after P1's stockout (sold 0 due to 0 inventory), I will order to cover the expected shortfall and a small buffer. Ordering 100 units ensures we don't stock out in P4 if demand stays elevated at 125.",

My inventory strategy accounts for the persistent ~50% supply loss rate and variable lead time (1-3 periods). A pipeline audit shows that of the 1815 units reported in-transit, 1665 units (from P1-P26) are confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P34 (50 units), P36 (50 units), and P37 (50 units).

Specifically, demand has been 62, 57, 64, 61, 35, and 60. I will forecast demand at approximately 60 units/period for the immediate horizon. Regarding logistics, the 'In-transit' figure of 1915 is heavily inflated by 1715 historical units categorized as lost (P1-P34).

Total effective stock (On-hand + Reliable Pipeline) is 495 units. Given an expected lead time of 2-3 periods, 495 units covers roughly 8 weeks of demand (495 / 60 = 8.25), which is quite high compared to our L+1 target. However, the supplier's ~50% loss rate suggests that about half of the 200 units in-transit might never arrive. If we assume a 50% loss, the effective inventory is 295 (current) + 100 (adjusted pipeline) = 395 units (~6.5 weeks). This is still sufficient.

This drop may be a temporary 'breather' before a late-December surge or the post-holiday dip starting early. Period 45 (Dec 16) is the final peak holiday week before Christmas.
