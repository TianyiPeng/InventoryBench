Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. There is no prior history of sales or inventory beyond the provided samples. Historical demand (last 5 weeks) averaged 18.2 units (28, 20, 21, 11, 11). There is a slight downward trend in the last two weeks, but for the first decision, I will rely on the full sample set to establish a baseline. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The OR backend will compute a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Using 'default' methods will naturally use the mean (18.2) and standard deviation (~7.2) from the provided samples. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit, the system will place an initial stock-up order.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is Jeggings, a staple denim item. History shows demand values of 28, 20, 21, 11, 11 (pre-game) and 12 (Period 1). The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 17.1. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) because the first order (31 units) is still in transit, adhering to the promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the timing rules, an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives during Period 3's arrival phase and becomes visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. Therefore, we should see an arrival in Period 3. To calculate the OR parameters: L is set to 'default' (2). mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. Using the recent 6 samples, average weekly demand is ~17. mu_hat = 3 * 17 = 51. sigma_hat should reflect the volatility; the standard deviation of recent samples [28, 20, 21, 11, 11, 12] is ~6.8. sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 6.8 \u2248 11.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this recent lower demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. Looking at the demand history (28, 20, 21, 11, 11, 12, 10), there is a clear downward shift starting in February compared to January. The January mean was approximately 20, while the February mean is approximately 11. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (31 units) and P2 (29 units) are still in transit; the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible in the P4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in P1 and P2 (sold 0 units despite demand). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the lower February demand regime (avg ~11) while maintaining the promised lead time of 2. This helps avoid over-ordering during a lower demand period while waiting for the initial pipeline to land.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is Jeggings, a staple item with significant demand (mean ~18 units/week based on initial samples, though recent weeks P1-P3 show a dip to 12, 10, 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales. There are 60 units in-transit: 31 ordered in P1 and 29 ordered in P2. Promised lead time is 2. The order from P1 (31 units) should arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This implies the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since we cannot sell what we don't have, I need to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the likely arrival of these 60 units soon while planning for the (L+1) demand window. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 3 periods show a mean of 9.33, while the initial 5 samples showed 18.2. I'll use a recent N=5 (P1-P3 plus the last two pre-game samples) to find a middle ground as we await the spring season, where denim demand often stabilizes or increases. Sigma_hat will use the same window to capture recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). SKU 399223034 (Ladies Denim Jeggings) has observed demand for the first 4 periods (12, 10, 6, 5) which is lower than the historical sample mean (approx. 18.2). A downward trend/regime shift is visible since Period 1. Lead time for the Period 2 order was confirmed at 2 periods (arrived Period 4). The Period 1 order (31 units) is currently missing/overdue (promised L=2, expected arrival P3, but P4 conclude shows only P2 order arrived). This creates a 'black hole' in the pipeline if it's lost. On-hand is 24, and in-transit is 31 (this reflects the P1 order). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the lower current demand trend (approx 10.4/period) while including some historical context to avoid under-stocking. I will use default L=2 as the P2 order arrived on time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a core denim staple. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged 18.2 units/week, but recent observed demand in the game (P1-P5) has been lower: 12, 10, 6, 5, 2 (average 7.0). This indicates a post-holiday/early spring slump or a shift in regime. On-hand inventory is 22. In-transit is 31 units (placed in Period 1). The promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (actual lead_time=2). The order from Period 1 (31 units) is now 3 periods overdue (P1+2=P3, yet no arrival recorded by P5 conclude). Given the 'In-transit' still shows 31, the shipment is likely delayed rather than lost, but its arrival is uncertain. To avoid over-ordering while demand is trending down, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower current demand mean, and default lead time as one order did arrive on time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, current on-hand inventory is 19 units. One order of 31 units from Period 1 is still in transit; based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, it is significantly overdue (was expected in Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start). However, an order from Period 2 arrived successfully in Period 4 (lead time 2). The Period 1 order might be lost or severely delayed. Historical demand (given samples + history) shows a mean of approx 11.5 units/week. More recent demand has dropped: Period 4 (5), Period 5 (2), Period 6 (3), suggesting a slowing trend as we move further into spring for this denim product. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (Periods 2-6: 10, 6, 5, 2, 3) to reflect this recent low demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. L is set to default (2) because one order arrived on time, despite the potentially lost Period 1 shipment.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 399223034 (Ladies Jeggings) shows a significant demand shift. Historical demand from Jan/Feb averaged ~18 units (samples: 28, 20, 21, 11, 11, 12, 10, 6). However, the last four periods (March onwards) show a distinct decline to an average of 4.25 units (samples: 5, 2, 3, 7). This aligns with the transition from winter/early spring into late spring. Regarding logistics, a shipment of 31 units ordered in Period 1 (with a promised lead time of 2) has not arrived by Period 8 start (overdue by 5 periods). Since the 'In-transit' count still shows 31, the OR backend considers it part of the pipeline, but the physical absence suggests a lost or severely delayed shipment. To compensate, I set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the lower spring demand regime (avg ~4.25). I use 'explicit' for L=2 to match the promised lead time, as trusting the 'calculate' method would include the potentially lost shipment's delay and inflate lead time variance unnecessarily. I set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=4) to match the current demand stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 4 (early March): Average weekly demand dropped from ~18 to ~4.25 (-76%). Possible lost shipment: 31 units ordered in Period 1 (promised LT=2) are effectively missing as of Period 8.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The product (Ladies Denim Jeggings) has experienced a significant demand drop since early March. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is 3.8 units/period, compared to the initial sample average of ~18. The shipment of 31 units from P1 is now 8 periods in-transit with a promised lead time of 2, confirming it is lost. My decision for Period 9 considers the low demand regime (using recent_N=5) and treats the 31 units in-transit as non-existent to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering because of 'ghost' inventory. Lead time is set to default (2) as the P2 order arrived correctly in 2 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock covering (L+1) periods of this lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 1 order (31 units) hasn't arrived by Period 9 (7 periods late). Demand stabilized at new low regime: P4-P8 avg is 3.8 units/period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019 (Period 10). The item (Jeggings) is in a low-demand regime that started in early March (Period 4). The average demand from Period 4 to Period 9 is 3.5 units per week (5, 2, 3, 7, 2, 2). This is a significant drop from the pre-season levels. The order from Period 1 (31 units) is now 7 periods past its promised delivery date and is confirmed as a lost shipment; however, it remains in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. Because the OR backend subtracts in-transit units from the target base stock, it will not place a new order as long as it believes those 31 units are coming. To force the engine to order if needed (though current on-hand of 8 units covers over two weeks of demand), I will set the lead time to 'explicit' at the promised value of 2 to ensure the backend doesn't overstate the safety stock based on the outlier LT of the lost shipment. Mu_hat is set to 10.5 (3.5 * (1+2)) using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the contemporary demand regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent 6 periods to match this regime's volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for this item (High Waist Jeggings) has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 4 (early March). The average demand from Period 4 to Period 10 is approximately 3.57 units per week, compared to the initial samples averaging 18.2 units. The 31 units ordered in Period 1 (promised LT=2) are now 8 periods late and are considered lost; however, they remain in the system's 'In-transit' count. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly assuming this pipeline inventory will arrive and satisfy future demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=7, covering the low-demand regime). Since the only successful arrival (Period 2 order) arrived with a lead time of 2, I will use the default promised lead time of 2. By focusing on the recent 7 periods, the backend will target a lower base stock reflecting current demand (~3.6 units/period), helping to avoid over-ordering despite the 'In-transit' phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~3.6 units/period (P4-P10 avg). The Period 1 order (31 units) remains in-transit but is confirmed lost, necessitating a focus on recent demand to avoid holding cost on unnecessary new stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product (Ladies Denim Jeggings) has transitioned into a low-demand regime since early March (Period 4). History from P4 to P11 shows demand values: 5, 2, 3, 7, 2, 2, 4, 5. The mean of these 8 samples is 3.75 units per period. I am choosing N=8 to capture this specific regime. The original order from Period 1 (31 units) is officially lost as it is now 11 periods from the order date with no arrival; however, since it remains in the 'In-transit' field, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will effectively block any new orders because the 31 'ghost' units exceed any reasonable base stock for the current demand level. To mitigate this and trigger a small replenishment order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Even though the actual mean is 3.75, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 31 units in pipeline. To cover 3 periods (L+1=3) at 3.75 units/period, the base stock would normally be ~11. To force an order despite the 31 units in pipeline, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the pipeline plus desired safety stock. However, since the system takes 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)', if pipeline (31) > base_stock, no order will occur. Thus, I will use recent_N=8 to reflect the actual demand regime and acknowledge that no order will likely trigger until the pipeline is cleared or the 'ghost' inventory is resolved.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in Period 13. The product is a staple item (Jeggings), and demand has entered a low-volume regime since early March (Period 4). Recent demand (P4-P12) averages 4.22 units per period, while demand in the last two periods spiked slightly (5 and 8 units). On-hand inventory is now 0. The 31 units ordered in Period 1 (12 periods ago) are confirmed lost, as their arrival is long past the promised lead time of 2. Because the on-hand inventory is empty and there is no incoming stock, we must place a new order. I will set the lead time to its promised 2 periods (as Period 2's order arrived on schedule in Period 4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (covering the regime shift from Period 4 to 12) to capture the current lower demand level while acknowledging the recent uptick. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock that covers (1+2)=3 periods of demand at approximately 4.2 units/period, minus the pipeline (which is 0 once the lost shipment is disregarded by the OR engine's inability to reconcile it).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jeggings H.W', a ladies' denim item. Currently, we are in Period 14 (mid-May). Since Period 4 (early March), the demand has shifted significantly lower, averaging 3.6 - 4.0 units per week. The last three periods show demand values of 5, 8, and 4. Most critically, the 31 units ordered in Period 1 (promised lead time 2) have never arrived and are now 11 periods overdue. These units are effectively lost but remain in the 'in-transit' pipeline. Because the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, and the base stock for the current low-demand regime (approx. 12-15 units needed for L+1=3 weeks) is much lower than the 31 'ghost' units in-transit, the system will not place new orders despite zero on-hand inventory. To force an order to replenish stock, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds 31. Based on recent demand (~5.7 avg over the last 3 periods), I estimate a 3-week demand (L+1) of ~18 units. To overcome the 31-unit pipeline blockage, I will set mu_hat to 40. This should trigger an order of roughly 9 units (40 - 31), which aligns with current demand needs while accounting for the lost shipment.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a pair of ladies' denim jeggings. The historical demand shows a clear regime shift occurring around Period 4 (early March), where demand dropped from an average of ~18 units per week to ~3.8 units per week (periods 4-14). The order from Period 1 (31 units) is definitively lost, as it is 12 periods overdue. A new order of 13 units was placed in Period 14 (expected to arrive in Period 16), which leaves the total in-transit at 44 units (31 lost + 13 actual). However, the OR engine considers the 'in-transit' total of 44 when calculating how many more units to order. Since 44 units significantly exceeds any reasonable base stock level for the current demand regime (~3.8 units/period), the OR backend will not order additional units unless the base stock calculation exceeds 44. To ensure no further orders are placed while we wait for the 13 units (which covers roughly 3 periods of demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (periods 4-14) to capture the low-demand regime and maintain the promised lead time L=2.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 16 (2019/5/27) shows 0 on-hand inventory and 44 units in-transit. The in-transit total consists of 31 units from Period 1 (confirmed lost), and 13 units ordered in Period 14. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 14 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of this period (Period 16). The demand continues to be in a low regime, with the average demand since Period 4 being approximately 4 units/period, despite a slight spike to 7 units in Period 15 as summer approaches. I will use recent_N=12 (covering Periods 4 to 15) for demand forecasting to capture the sustained low-demand regime while including the slightly higher recent samples. L is set to 'default' as the Period 2 order arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 2 periods, and the current delay in the Period 1 order is treated as a lost shipment rather than a lead time shift.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For SKU 399223034, we are in early June. Historical demand analysis shows a low-demand regime starting from P4 (early March), with an average of ~3 units/period until mid-May. However, the last two periods (P15-P16) have seen a significant spike with demands of 7 and 13 units respectively. This may indicate a summer seasonal uptick for 'Jeggings'. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand). The 31 units ordered in P1 are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' quantity of 44 units consists of the lost 31 units (P1) and a recent order of 13 units from P14. Since the lead time is 2, the P14 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P16 and should be visible for our use in P17 (as arrivals occur before demand resolution). To account for the recent demand surge while acknowledging the low-demand spring baseline, I will use a recent_N method. For mu_hat, N=5 captures the shift and the recent spikes (averaging ~5.4 units/period). I'll use the default calculate for L as there is no evidence of lead time extension beyond the 2-period promise (excluding the lost shipment).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand uptick detected starting P15 (mid-May): Demand increased from a spring average of ~3.6 to 10.0 units/period (last 2 weeks).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Ladies Jeggings) has entered a massive seasonal demand spike. While demand from Period 4 to 14 averaged ~3.6 units/period, the last three periods (P15-P17) showed demand of 7, 13, and a massive 98 units, respectively. Date: June 10, 2019. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' of 44 units consists of the long-lost Period 1 order (31 units) and a Period 14 order (13 units). The Period 14 order should have arrived in Period 16 (LT=2) or 17 but is now overdue by at least one period, suggesting erratic lead times or further logistics issues. Given the critical stockout and the massive demand spike (98 units), we must aggressively increase the base stock level. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to account for this sudden seasonality change. Based on the 98-unit spike, I'll estimate the look-ahead demand for (L+1=3) periods at approximately 150 units to rebuild inventory while the OR engine caps the order to avoid excessive risk.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal spike confirmed in June: Period 17 demand reached 98 units, a nearly 10x increase over the previous 2-week average. Lead times are unreliable: Period 14 order (13 units) is at least 1 period overdue as of Period 18 conclusion observation window.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal June peak for Jeggings. Last period (P18) demand was 73, and P17 was 98. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 137 units, consisting of 13 units from P14 (now 4 periods overdue and likely lost), 31 units from P1 (confirmed lost), and 93 units ordered in P18. Given the lead time of 2 periods, the P18 order should arrive in P20. To ensure we meet demand for the next (L+1)=3 periods (P19, P20, P21), we must account for the high volatility. The OR backend will subtract 'Pipeline' from the base stock. Since 44 units (31+13) are effectively lost, they falsely inflate the pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to roughly 3 periods of the current high demand (~80/period * 3 = 240) and increase sigma_hat to reflect the extreme volatility (98 vs 73). This ensures the order placed now, plus the valid P18 order, covers the peak.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal peak confirmed: demand surged from <10 to avg 85.5 units/period in P17-P18. Shipment from P14 (13 units) is confirmed lost/extraordinarily delayed (promising L=2, current L=5 without arrival).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal peak for denim jeggings (June). Demand in Period 17 (98 units), Period 18 (73 units), and Period 19 (41 units) confirms a significant surge compared to the spring average of ~4. Recent demand (P17-P19) averages 70.6 units/period. The Period 18 order (93 units) arrived early in Period 19 (lead time = 1). The Period 19 order (142 units) is in-transit, along with the presumed lost orders from Period 1 (31 units) and Period 14 (13 units). Because the backend includes all in-transit units (186) in its pipeline calculation, and 44 of those are likely lost, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that covers the current peak and accounts for this 'phantom' inventory. Using the recent 3-period demand average (70.6) over a 3-period horizon (L+1) gives 211.8. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 260 to aggressively signal the need for stock to the OR backend, ensuring the 142 units in transit are bolstered against the volatile peak and the dead stock in the pipeline inventory count.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time for the Period 18 order was 1 period, suggesting potential for faster replenishment during this peak, though previous orders (P1, P14) remain lost/severely delayed.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal period for 'Jeggings in washed, superstretch denim' (July start). Historical demand in early 2019 was low (avg ~4), but surged in June (P17: 98, P18: 73, P19: 41, P20: 34). While the peak appeared to be mid-June, demand remains significantly higher than the spring baseline. The Carry-over insights and P20 data show demand stabilizing at a new elevated level (averaging 37.5 units/period over the last 2 weeks). Regarding lead times, while P1 and P14 orders were lost, the P18 order arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period. This suggests that the logistics pipeline for successful deliveries is currently faster than the promised 2 periods (L=1). I will set L to 'recent_N' (N=3) to capture this improved speed and use 'recent_N' (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ground the forecast in the current June/July demand regime (avg ~61.5) while smoothing out the extreme P17 peak. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated seasonal demand while accounting for the current faster delivery tempo.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization: Following the mid-June spike, demand for P19-P20 has averaged 37.5 units/period, roughly 10x the spring average. Lead time for the most recent successful shipment was 1 period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Jeggings) is in a post-peak stabilization phase following a significant June seasonal surge. Demand has settled around 34 units/period (P19-P21 average is 34; P21 demand was 27). We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand) due to the Period 21 demand exceeding inventory. There are 250 units in transit (Period 19 order of 142 and Period 20 order of 64, plus older lost shipments). Although the Period 18 order arrived in 1 period, the promised lead time remains 2, and historical reliability is mixed (P1 and P14 orders lost). I am setting L to the promised 2 periods to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon (L+1=3). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the post-peak mean (~34 units) without being skewed by the massive June spike (98, 73) or the low spring average (~4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility. With 206 'real' units in transit (excluding lost P1 and P14 orders), the backend will likely not place a large new order, which is appropriate given the current inventory pipeline relative to stabilized demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed: Period 19-21 average demand is 34 units/period, down from the June peak (~85) but significantly higher than the spring floor (~4).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 has transitioned from a June peak (avg ~85) to a mid-July stabilization phase. Over the last four periods (P19-P22), demand has been 41, 34, 27, and 23. This shows a clear downward trend from the peak but remains significantly higher than the spring floor. The average of these four periods is 31.25. Given the clear downward trajectory, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stabilization while acknowledging the declining trend. Lead times have recently been 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.5). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect this improved reliability compared to the earlier lost shipments. Note: The in-transit inventory includes 44 units from lost or severely delayed orders (P1: 31, P14: 13), which the OR backend will treat as pipeline; I will maintain a consistent mu_hat to ensure active replenishment covers actual needs despite these 'ghost' units in the pipeline tally.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand contraction: Demand is trending downward from mid-June peak (P19: 41 to P22: 23), currently averaging ~31 over the last 4 weeks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Jeggings', which experienced a massive seasonal spike in June (P17-P18). Following this peak, demand remained elevated but volatile: P19-P23 demand was [41, 34, 27, 23, 72], averaging 39.4 units/period. The most recent demand (P23) spiked again to 72, indicating that the 'post-peak contraction' mentioned in carry-over insights may have been premature, or there is significant residual volatility in July. Lead times for successful shipments have been 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.5). We have 186 units in-transit (orders from P1, P14, and P19 are the primary candidates, with P1 and P14 confirmed lost). Specifically, the P19 order of 142 units is now due (P19 + LT 2 + 1-period obs delay). If P19 arrives, on-hand will be replenished. To prevent over-ordering due to the high in-transit count (186 units, most of which are the P19 order and lost P1/P14 stock), I will base mu_hat on the last 5 periods (the post-peak window) to capture the current mean of ~39. This balanced approach protects against the risk of the P19 order also being lost while recognizing the current high demand level.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand volatility confirmed: After a mid-June surge, July demand remains elevated but erratic (ranging 23-72), averaging ~39 units/period (P19-P23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29), we are in a post-peak seasonal demand regime. After a significant June surge (peaking at 98 units), July demand (Periods 20-24) has been erratic but remains substantially higher than the spring baseline, averaging approximately 39.6 units per period (34, 27, 23, 72, 42). The most recent demand was 42 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 186 units in transit (likely the P19 order of 142 units and the P14 order of 13 units, though P14 is almost certainly lost). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods for successful arrivals. Given the high volatility and current zero on-hand stock, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent high-demand regime using N=6 (Periods 19-24) to capture the stabilization period. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to account for the high volatility (SD is significantly higher now than in the spring). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed average, as arrivals have recently occurred within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime (P20-P24) identified with an average of ~40 units/period and high volatility (range 23-72).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399223034 (Jeggings) is in an elevated demand regime following a June peak. Period 26 (August 5) falls in late summer, where demand remains significantly higher than the spring baseline but reflects high volatility. The last 5 periods (P21-P25) have seen demand of 27, 23, 72, 42, and 55, averaging 43.8 units/period. The current 'In-transit' of 186 units likely includes the large order from Period 19 (142 units) which is now 7 periods old and potentially lost or significantly delayed, similar to previous losses in P1 and P14. Excluding these likely lost units (31 + 13 + 142 = 186), the actual functional pipeline is zero and on-hand inventory is zero. We must replenish to meet this late-summer demand. Choosing recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the current July/August average (~44 units/period), while L=default (2) is used as it is the promised lead time, accounting for the recent successful 1-2 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime (P21-P25) remains elevated with an average of 43.8 units/period. Shipment from Period 19 (142 units) is now highly suspect as lost or severely delayed (7 periods since order vs promised L=2).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223034' (Jeggings) is in an elevated demand regime following a June peak. Demand in August has surged again, with Period 26 reaching 97 units. The current inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and despite 186 units being 'in-transit', historical evidence and carry-over insights strongly suggest major losses. Specifically, Period 1 (31 units), Period 14 (13 units), and now Period 19 (142 units) are highly likely lost or severely delayed (Period 19 is now 8 periods since order vs a promised L=2). Only orders from P18 and P20 have arrived successfully in the last 10 periods. Consequently, the 186 units in-transit (P1: 31, P14: 13, P19: 142) should be treated as non-existent for planning. To recover from the current stockout and meet the August demand (avg ~64 over last 3 weeks), I am using 'explicit' L=3 to account for potential delivery delays despite the promised L=2, 'recent_N' N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (Period 22-26 avg ~58), and 'recent_N' N=5 for sigma_hat to account for high volatility (range 23-97). This will trigger a substantial new order to bypass the 'ghost' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Massive pipeline failure confirmed. Total of 186 units (P1: 31, P14: 13, P19: 142) are effectively lost, as the only successful recent arrivals (P18, P20) arrived within 1-2 periods. August demand has spiked again (P26: 97), requiring aggressive re-ordering to bypass stalled in-transit stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a demand spike in August (P26: 97, P27: 123). The 'In-transit' quantity of 279 is extremely misleading due to confirmed pipeline failures: P1 (31), P14 (13), and P19 (142) units are effectively lost (186 total units). This leaves only the P27 order (93 units) as potentially viable in the pipeline. To restore service level against current demand (~110 units/week), we must bypass the stalled in-transit figures. We use an 'explicit' lead time of 2 periods (promised) despite some orders being lost, and an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as 3 periods (L+1) * 110 units/period = 330. We set sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the erratic August volatility. The OR backend's capped policy will subtract the 'In-transit' (279) from our base_stock; if we don't set mu_hat high enough to overcome this phantom inventory, the system will not order.

Carry-over insight: August Demand Spike: Demand has surged to an average of 110 units/period (P26-P27) from the July average of ~40. Pipeline Failure Update: 186 units (from P1, P14, P19) are confirmed lost/indefinitely stalled, leaving significant phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' calculation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late August 2019. Demand for 'Jeggings H.W' is in a high-growth regime, with the last three periods averaging ~108 units (P26: 97, P27: 123, P28: 103). The 'In-transit' figure of 381 is deceptive because it includes 186 units from lost/severely delayed shipments (P1: 31, P14: 13, P19: 142). Effective pipeline is only 195 units (P27: 93, P28: 102). With current demand exceeding 100 per week and a 2-period lead time, we need at least 300+ units to cover the pipeline (L+1 demand). I will use 'explicit' methods to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the total In-transit value and historical averages that include the low-demand spring era. L is set to 2 (promised). Mu_hat is set to 330 (110 units/period * 3 periods) to reflect the current August surge. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for high volatility observed in this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Late August Demand Peak: Demand for P26-P28 has stabilized at an average of 107.7 units per period, up from the July average of ~40. Pipeline effectively contains 186 units of dead inventory (P1, P14, P19).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for late summer/early autumn, with the average demand over the last 4 periods (P26-P29) being 108.25 units. There is a deep historical trend of lead time instability. Specifically, 186 units are categorized as lost or indefinitely stalled (P1: 31, P14: 13, P19: 142). The 'In-transit' figure of 381 units is heavily inflated by this 'phantom inventory'. Subtracting the 186 lost units leaves a real pipeline of 195 units (P27: 93, P28: 102). Since actual successful lead times recently have been 1-2 periods, we expect these 195 units to arrive shortly, but currently, on-hand is 0. To prevent persistent stockouts during this high-demand phase while the OR backend likely underestimates the order need due to the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the high demand (110 units/period) across the review and promised lead time (1+2=3 periods), totaling 330. L is set to explicit 2 to match the promised lead time while we wait for the P27/P28 shipments to resolve.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed August/September demand peak: Average of 108.25 units/period (P26-P29). Dead inventory in pipeline remains at 186 units (P1, P14, P19), creating a consistent gap between system 'In-transit' and actual expected arrivals.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the demand for SKU 399223034 is in an elevated late-summer/early-autumn regime. The last 5 periods (P26-P30) show an average demand of 111.8 units, reflecting a significant peak compared to July. The arrivals in Period 30 (93 units from P27 and 102 units from P28) confirm that lead times are fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.5 for recent successful deliveries. The pipeline currently shows 186 units in-transit, but as noted in carry-over insights, these (from P1, P14, and P19) are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'phantom' inventory, I am using an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2, plus current period) based on the recent 5-period mean (approx 112 * 3 = 336), and explicitly setting L=2. I will set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in late August (Period 26). The average demand from Period 26 to Period 31 is approximately 114.3 units per period (97, 123, 103, 110, 126, 127). This represents a sustained peak compared to the July average of ~40. The pipeline currently shows 286 units in-transit, but 186 of these (from Periods 1, 14, and 19) are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled, as established in previous carry-over insights. The recent successful arrivals in Period 30 (ordered P27 and P28) confirm an actual lead time (L) of 2-3 periods. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand is consistently exceeding 120 units, I must set mu_hat to cover this elevated demand level. I am using recent_N=6 to capture this entire high-demand window (P26-P31). I am using explicit lead time L=2 to reflect the promised and recently observed timing, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current period plus lead time (3 periods of demand). The high sigma_hat (recent_N=6) reflects the volatility within this peak to maintain a high service level given current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: September demand peak confirmed: P26-P31 average demand is 114.3 units/period (range 97-127). Dead inventory in pipeline remains fixed at 186 units (P1, P14, P19).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (Sept 23) shows the SKU is in a sustained high-demand regime following the August/September peak. Recent demand (P26-P32) averages 112.3 units/period. The pipeline inventory (262 units) includes 186 units of confirmed dead/lost stock (P1: 31, P14: 13, P19: 142). Effective pipeline is only 76 units (ordered P32). On-hand is 0. Lead times have been volatile but recently short (P31 arrived in 1 period, P28 in 2, P27 in 3). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet current demand while discounting the 186 phantom units, I am using 'explicit' L=2 (promised) and mu_hat=337 (calculated as (1+L)*112.3). For sigma_hat, I'm using recent_N=7 to capture the volatility of the current peak. By setting mu_hat explicitly to mirror actual demand despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I force the system to reconcile the stock gap.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jeggings H.W' is currently in a sustained peak regime (August-September) with an average demand of approximately 111.9 units per period over the last 8 weeks (P26-P33). The most recent demand (P33) was 102 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline shows 356 units. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 186 of these units (from P1, P14, P19) are confirmed lost/stalled, leaving an effective pipeline of 170 units (76 units from P32 and 94 units from P33). Lead times have been variable but generally range between 1-3 periods. To ensure availability during this high-demand period while accounting for the 'phantom' inventory in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1 review period) at the recent average (~112 * 3 = 336). I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the average of observed successful deliveries. To compensate for the 186 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly thinks are coming, mu_hat is further adjusted upward (336 + 186 = 522) to force the order logic to ignore the dead stock.

Carry-over insight: September demand remains strong, averaging 111.9 units/period (P26-P33). Effective pipeline excludes 186 units of dead inventory (P1, P14, P19). Recent successful lead times are 1-3 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for focus SKU 399223034 (Jeggings) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since late August, averaging 111.4 units/period over the last 9 weeks (P26-P34). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an in-transit pipeline of 552 units, but this includes 186 units of confirmed dead/lost inventory (orders from P1, P14, P19). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 366 units (552 - 186). Recent successful lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent order (P31) arriving in 1 period, but P33 and P34 are still outstanding. To maintain availability during this peak while accounting for the ~33.7% 'phantom' stock in the reported pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover 115 units per period for the review + lead time window (L+1 = 3), totaling 345 units. I am using a recent_N sigma calculation (N=9) to capture current volatility and setting L=2 (promised) as the base for the backend's calculation. The goal is to ensure the backend places orders that keep pace with the ~111/week consumption rate, ignoring the 186 stalled units.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand regime remains stable at ~111 units/period (P26-P34). Effective pipeline adjustment: continue to subtract 186 units (P1, P14, P19) from system in-transit calculations to account for lost shipments.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jeggings H.W' remains in a stable high-demand regime, averaging ~108 units/period over the last 10 weeks (P26-P35). The in-transit pipeline of 476 units contains 186 units of confirmed 'dead' inventory (from P1, P14, P19) that have been missing for 17+ periods. My logic must adjust for this phantom stock to ensure the OR engine actually orders. Effective pipeline = 476 (System) - 186 (Lost) = 290 units. These 290 units correspond to orders from P33 (94 units), P34 (196 units), and P35 (0 units), which are within the normal 1-3 period lead time window observed recently. Current demand is 80 units (P35), showing a slight dip from the 110+ average, but consistent with seasonal high volume. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this stable peak period and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (~15-20 units) seen in this regime. This ensures a high service level during the peak while managing the risk of over-ordering if demand starts to taper in late October.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand is showing signs of cooling off from the Aug/Sept peak (P36: 56 units vs. ~110 avg), moving into late October. We must account for the 186 units of dead inventory (P1, P14, P19) that remain in the system 'In-transit' count (382 - 186 = 196 actual effective in-transit). The 196 units ordered in P34 are likely arriving soon, as recent lead times have varied between 1-3 periods (P32, P33 reached 3 periods). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the period since the late August spike) to capture the stabilization and recent drop. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=11) to account for the high volatility during this high-demand period. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed variability (1-3 periods) instead of the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand contraction detected late October: Period 36 demand (56) is significantly lower than the P26-P35 average (~111), suggesting the end of the late-summer/early-fall peak.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38 (late October), we are seeing a clear contraction from the summer/early fall peak demand (~111 units/period). Demand has dropped to 56 (P36) and 69 (P37), averaging 62.5 over the last two weeks. This indicates a seasonal shift as we move into late autumn. Inventory management must adjust to this lower regime to avoid excess holding costs. The system shows 382 units in-transit, but 186 units (from P1, P14, P19) are confirmed lost and must be subtracted, leaving an effective pipeline of 196 units (ordered Period 34). Given recent lead times of 1-3 periods, these 196 units are expected to arrive imminently (P38 or P39). I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent downward trend (averaging ~76 units/period), and setting sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this transition. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the variation in recent successful arrivals (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand contraction confirmed late Oct/early Nov: Average demand dropped from ~111 (P26-P35) to ~62.5 (P36-P37), a ~44% reduction. Pipeline remains inflated by 186 units of dead inventory (P1, P14, P19).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 has entered a contraction phase as of late October (Period 36). The previous peak regime (P26-P35) averaged ~111 units/period, but the last three periods (P36-P38) show a significant drop to an average of 58.33 units/period (56, 69, 50). Using a recent_N window for mu_hat with N=3 captures this shift. The pipeline inventory (382 units) is severely inflated by 'phantom' or lost stock. Specifically, orders from P1 (31), P14 (13), and P19 (142) totaling 186 units are confirmed lost based on successful arrivals (P27, P28, P31, P32, P33) concluding within 1-3 periods. This leaves an effective in-transit balance of 196 (from P34), which is more than sufficient to cover the current three-period demand horizon (L+1 = 3) at the new mean of ~58 (+ volatility). No new orders are needed; the explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend does not over-order against stalled in-transit figures.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand contraction confirmed: P36-P38 average demand is 58.3 units/period, down ~47% from the late-summer peak. Effective pipeline remains 186 units lower than the system 'In-transit' value due to lost shipments at P1, P14, and P19.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 399223034 has significantly contracted from its late-summer peak (~111/week) to a new post-peak regime. Over the last four periods (P36-P39), demand has averaged 54.75 units per period (56, 69, 50, 44), representing a ~50% drop. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The internal system 'In-transit' shows 382 units, but this includes 186 units of confirmed dead/lost inventory from Periods 1, 14, and 19 (31 + 13 + 142). Thus, the effective pipeline is 196 units (the order from P34). Given the current lead time (promised L=2, recently observed L=1-3) and the demand average of ~55, the effective pipeline of 196 units already covers approximately 3.5 periods of demand. With the OR backend's base-stock target (which sees the inflated/dead inventory), I must set mu_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and use the sigma_hat to manage volatility. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to specifically target the post-peak contraction (avg ~55), and N=4 for sigma_hat (std ~11) across the L+1 window.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand contraction stable: P36-P39 average demand is 54.75 units/period. Effective pipeline remains 186 units lower than system 'In-transit' due to legacy lost shipments (P1, P14, P19).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is mid-November. Demand has confirmed a downward trend from the late-summer/early-fall peak of ~111 units/period. The new post-peak regime (P36-P40) averages 50.6 units/period (56, 69, 50, 44, 34). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The system 'In-transit' shows 382 units, but this includes 186 units of confirmed dead/lost inventory from older periods (P1: 31, P14: 13, P19: 142). The effective pipeline is 196 units (specifically the Period 34 order). Successful lead times recently ranged from 1-3 periods. I will set L to 3 to be safe, mu_hat to the recent 5-period average (50.6 * 4 = 202.4), and sigma_hat based on the same period to account for the current demand stabilization levels. Although the order from Period 34 (196 units) is within the expected lead time window (ordered P34, current P41 start), it hasn't arrived yet. The OR backend will see (on-hand 0 + in-transit 382) = 382, which is higher than the target base stock, likely resulting in no new order. This is appropriate as the 196 units from P34 are sufficient to cover current demand levels if they arrive soon.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (late Oct - Nov) stable at ~50.6 units/period (P36-P40); 186 units of legacy in-transit stock remain confirmed lost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the demand regime has stabilized following the late-summer peak. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P36-P41) is 51.8 units, confirming the post-peak contraction from the previous ~111 units/period average. The 'In-transit' figure of 382 units consists of 186 units of confirmed dead/lost inventory from Periods 1, 14, and 19 (31 + 13 + 142) and 196 units from the Period 34 order. This P34 order is now 8 periods old (promised lead time 2), which strongly suggests it is also lost or severely delayed, especially since the only successful deliveries between P30-P36 had lead times of 1-3 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and the entire pipeline likely non-functional, a fresh order is needed to meet the current demand of ~52 units/period. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*52 = 156 and use a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for recent volatility and the risk of further delivery inconsistencies.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Fresh pipeline failure suspected. The 196 units ordered in Period 34 are now 8 periods overdue (Promised L=2), suggesting they are lost alongside the 186 units from P1, P14, and P19. Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory is now estimated at 382 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (late November) saw a massive demand spike of 338 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for this 'Jeggings' SKU. This sharply contrasts with the previous 6-week average of ~52 units. In-transit inventory remains highly unreliable: 382 units are essentially confirmed lost (P1, P14, P19, P34), meaning the system's 'In-transit' count of 382 is comprised entirely of 'phantom' stock. Effective on-hand and pipeline are currently 0. Given the move into December, I will reposition for a sustained elevated demand regime, though likely not as extreme as the Black Friday burst. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated in-transit data. mu_hat is set to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand, targeting a forecast of ~120 units/period (reflecting the December peak potential, higher than the autumn average but lower than the anomalous P42 spike). Sigma_hat is set high (50% of the forecast) to provide a safety buffer against the extreme volatility observed in P42.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 338 units (Black Friday). Phantom inventory in pipeline increased to 382 units (P1, P14, P19, P34) which must be bypassed for effective ordering.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday shopping season (Period 44, Dec 9). Demand in Period 42 (Black Friday week) spiked to 338 units and remained significantly elevated in Period 43 (122 units). Based on the product description (Ladies superstretch denim jeggings), demand is expected to remain high through mid-to-late December. Regarding inventory, the system reports 512 units in-transit. However, historical analysis identifies 382 units as 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1: 31, P14: 13, P19: 142, P34: 196). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 130 units (the order from P43). With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 130, we must order more to cover the holiday peak. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 550, which targets a total stock (including effective pipeline) of roughly 2.5 periods of demand at a high holiday rate (~220 units/period for 2.5 periods = 550). This should bypass the phantom stock and trigger an order to meet immediate seasonal needs.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (late Nov-Dec): Average demand observed at ~230 units/period (P42-P43) vs post-peak fall average of ~50. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 382 units (P1, P14, P19, P34).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45). Demand has spiked significantly since mid-November (Period 42), with an average demand of approximately 196.7 units/period over the last 3 weeks (338, 122, 130). The 'In-transit' figure is currently 677 units, but this is severely inflated by several large, confirmed-lost shipments: Period 1 (31), Period 14 (13), Period 19 (142), and Period 34 (196), totaling 382 'phantom' units. Subtracting these from the 677 units leaves an actual effective pipeline of 295 units (the orders from Periods 43 and 44). Given the holiday peak, I will set mu_hat using the recent 3-period average (~197) to capture the surge. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the extreme volatility seen between the Black Friday peak (338) and subsequent weeks (~125). I am using 'explicit' for L to maintain a conservative estimate of 2, despite some recent arrivals being faster, to ensure the base stock calculation covers the necessary lead-time demand during this high-volume period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23 (Period 46), which represents the week before Christmas. We are currently in a holiday demand regime that started with a Black Friday spike in Period 42. Recent demand (P43-P45) has averaged 126 units/period, showing significant elevation compared to the fall average (~50) though lower than the peak surge of 338. We must account for massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Shipments from P1 (31), P14 (13), P19 (142), and now P34 (196) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 382 units. The current system 'In-transit' is 640. Subtracting the 382 phantom units leaves an effective pipeline of 258 units (orders from P44: 165 and P45: 93). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite this phantom inventory, L will be set to 'explicit' at 2 to represent the recent successful lead time, mu_hat will use the recent holiday regime average (N=4, approx 1120 across L+1 periods) to maintain supply through the end of the year, and sigma_hat will be set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (P43-P45) has stabilized at ~126 units/period following the Period 42 surge. Period 34 order (196 units) is now 12 periods overdue and confirmed lost, increasing total phantom inventory to 382 units (P1, P14, P19, P34).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 30, right after the Christmas/Holiday peak. Demand has transitioned from the Black Friday surge (338 units in P42) to a stable holiday regime averaging ~125 units/period (P43-P46: 122, 130, 126, 122). On-hand inventory is 0. The system 'In-transit' shows 688 units, but 382 units are confirmed 'phantom' stock from P1, P14, P19, and P34 that are far beyond any reasonable lead time and will not arrive. Effective pipeline consists of orders from P44 (165), P45 (93), and P46 (48), totaling 306 units. Given the transition to post-holiday January demand, I anticipate a drop from the 125 average, but must maintain stock to cover the L+1 window. Lead times are averaging 2. I set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the stable holiday average (~125), and allow the OR backend to determine the safety stock. This ensures we cover current demand while the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering as we enter the New Year.
