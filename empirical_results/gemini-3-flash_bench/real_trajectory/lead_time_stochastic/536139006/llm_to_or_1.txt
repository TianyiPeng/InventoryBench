Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the SKU 'Alex Jogger'. Historical demand for the preceding 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a relatively stable pattern with samples: 134, 130, 128, 144, 126. The mean of these samples is 132.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 7.2. The product is a lightweight pyjama bottom, which typically sees stable demand in early spring, though we should watch for transitions. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the starting parameters: mu_hat should cover (1 + L) periods, so (1 + 2) * 132.4 = 397.2. Sigma_hat should be sqrt(1 + L) * std, so sqrt(3) * 7.2 \u2248 12.47. Given we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately using the available history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). In Period 1, we placed an order for 145 units, which is currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods, so we expect this to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). In Period 1, we had 0 on-hand inventory and a demand of 82, resulting in 82 lost sales. Historical demand data shows a mean of approximately 136 units (samples: 134, 130, 128, 144, 126). However, the Period 1 demand (82) was significantly lower than the historical average. Since we are in the very early stages of the simulation and have only one actual game-period demand observation which deviates from the historical seed, I will bridge the gap by using a recent_N approach. Setting N=5 for demand incorporates the historical samples plus the most recent observed demand to smooth the transition. We have not yet observed any arrivals to calibrate the actual lead time, so we will stick with the promised L=2.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The SKU is 'Alex Jogger', a pyjama bottom. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of ~136 units (134, 130, 128, 144, 126). In-game demand for Period 1 (82) and Period 2 (110) has been lower, but we are currently stock-out (on-hand = 0) because we are waiting for orders to arrive. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (145 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 3 and become visible in Period 4's start. Since no orders have concluded yet, we maintain the default lead time (L=2). For demand estimation (mu_hat), the last 5 historical samples plus 2 in-game samples (total 7) provide a stable base; I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent patterns while acknowledging the current period is late February. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Alex Jogger' is a nightwear item. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged 132.4 units/week. Since the game started (P1-P3), observed demand has been slightly lower (82, 110, 84; avg ~92), but this may be due to the transition into Feb/March. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts because the promised lead time (L=2) means the P1 order (145 units) is only expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message which we just read. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0 for P3. This is consistent with the 'Critical Timing Example' - an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3 and its confirmation is seen at the start of P4. But wait, the history shows 'Period 3 conclude: arrived=0'. This implies the P1 order (placed P1) did NOT arrive in Period 3. This suggests either a lead time delay (L is likely 3 or more) or a lost shipment. Given we have zero stock and multiple orders in transit (P1: 145, P2: 161, P3: 107), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the slightly lower demand seen in the last three periods (avg 92), resulting in a forecast of (1+3)*92 = 368. This helps the OR backend target a higher base stock to recover from the stockout.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Analyzing SKU 536139006, the demand history (including provided pre-game samples) shows a relatively stable range: 134, 130, 128, 144, 126 (pre-game) and 82, 110, 84, 98 (game history). There is a slight drop in the game periods compared to pre-game, but no clear seasonal trend for early March. The first arrival occurred in Period 4 (ordered Period 2, lead_time 2), confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods is currently accurate. Inventory status: On-hand is 63, and In-transit is 259 (from orders in P1, P3, and P4). Note that the P1 order (145 units) is now one period overdue relative to the expected lead time of 2, as it should have arrived in P3 and been visible in P4 conclude. However, since the P2 order arrived on time, the P1 shipment might be delayed or potentially lost. I will maintain the lead time at 2 (default) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for the slightly lower demand seen since the game started (mean ~93.5 vs pre-game ~132). This conservative approach ensures we don't over-order while waiting for the pipeline to clear.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is a pair of lightweight pyjama bottoms for women, which usually shows stable baseline demand during early spring. Current date is March 18, 2019. Reviewing the history: The order from Period 1 (145 units) is currently overdue as the promised lead time is 2 periods and we are starting Period 6 (it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4). The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time 2). The order from Period 3 (107 units) should have arrived in Period 5 but didn't. This suggests either a shipping loss or an increase in actual lead time. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 259 in-transit (Period 1: 145, Period 3: 107, Period 4: 7). Demand has been relatively stable across the last 5 weeks (82, 110, 84, 98, 101), averaging approximately 95 units/week. Since the Period 1 order is significantly overdue (ordered 5 periods ago), I am treating those 145 units as potentially lost and moving to 'explicit' lead time to account for the delays observed in P3/P5. I will set mu_hat based on the (1+L) periods where L=2, using the observed mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Incoming shipment from Period 1 (145 units) is 3 periods late; Period 3 shipment (107 units) is 1 period late. Potential lead time instability or lost shipments detected.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation: We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is Alex Jogger (Nightwear). Stock is currently 0, with 374 units in transit. Analysis of concluded shipments: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). However, the Period 1 order (145 units) is now 4 periods overdue (6 periods since order, promised 2), and the Period 3 order (107 units) is 2 periods overdue. This suggests either significantly extended lead times or, more likely, lost shipments. Given we've hit 0 inventory and lost sales for two consecutive periods (P5, P6), we must act aggressively. Demand is relatively stable (mean ~107 across historical + game data). Because the backend OR engine subtracts 'pipeline' (in-transit) from its base stock calculation, if those shipments are lost but the engine thinks they are coming, it won't order enough. To force the OR to order, I will use an 'explicit' L to account for the risk and set mu_hat based on the recent stable demand (~100/week). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the slightly lower demand seen in-game compared to the Jan/Feb samples, and 'explicit' L=3 to hedge against late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (145 units) and Period 3 (107 units) are likely lost or severely delayed (4+ periods overdue). Systemic stockouts in P5-P6 due to supply failure.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the SKU 536139006 is in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of history shows significant lead time instability: the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4, but orders from Period 1 (145 units) and Period 3 (107 units) are now 5 and 3 periods overdue respectively, suggesting they may be lost. Demand is stable, ranging from 82 to 110 (avg ~96), but currently unmet. The 'In-transit' quantity of 460 units includes the likely lost shipments (145 + 107 = 252) and more recent orders (Period 4: 7, Period 6: 115, Period 7: 86). To compensate for the supply chain unreliability and high stockout risk (Profit/Holding ratio is 19:1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the stable ~96 average) and using an explicit lead time L=4 to effectively raise the inventory target and account for observed delays, ensuring the OR backend attempts to pull in more stock to cover the current deficit once it accounts for the pipeline correctly.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 1 (145 units) and Period 3 (107 units) shipments have failed to arrive after 5+ and 3+ periods respectively (Promised L=2). Systemic stockouts since Period 5.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), we observe that the supply chain is recovering but remains unstable. The shipments from Period 1 (145 units) and Period 3 (107 units) are officially lost or delayed indefinitely (7+ and 5+ periods late vs promised L=2). However, shipments from P6 and P7 arrived in P8 (lead times of 2 and 1 respectively), bringing on-hand inventory to 84 units. Current demand is stable: historical samples mean ~134 (Jan) and recently ~100. Over the last 4 periods (P5-P8), mean demand is 102.75 units. Despite the recovery, the loss of 252 units (P1+P3) creates a risk if we rely on the backend's 'in-transit' calculation, which likely still counts those lost units. To compensate for the pipeline vacuum caused by lost orders, I am using an explicit mu_hat forecast. I forecast demand at ~105 per period. For the (1+L) coverage (where L=2), mu_hat = 3 * 105 = 315. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to use the successful arrivals (L=2, L=1) to normalize expectations, while setting a tighter sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to account for the current demand regime's lower variance compared to the initial high Jan samples.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (145 units) and Period 3 (107 units) are confirmed lost/permanent failures; pipeline inventory is over-reported by 252 units. Supply resumed in Period 8 with actual lead times of 1-2 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 536139006 is currently experiencing stockouts (Ending on-hand: 0). Historical data shows that orders from Period 1 (145 units) and Period 3 (107 units) have failed to arrive and are confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 352 is inflated by 252 ghost units. The actual active pipeline is only 100 units (93 from Period 8, 7 from Period 4). Recent demand (last 5 periods) is stable, averaging ~100 units per period. In Period 8, we saw successful arrivals with lead times of 1 and 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized but is currently empty due to the previous losses. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*100 = 300 to reflect the current demand regime and force an order that compensates for the 'ghost' inventory. By keeping L at 2, the backend will target a base stock sufficient for 3 periods (~300 units). Since it subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' (352) and 'On-hand' (0), an explicit mu_hat is necessary to ensure the calculation results in a replenishment order that overcomes the reporting error.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered in Period 8 with lead times of 1-2 periods, following the total loss of Period 1 and Period 3 shipments (total 252 units). Current 'In-transit' count remains inflated by these 252 lost units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 536139006 (Alex Jogger) is a stable nightwear item with demand averaging around 100 units per week (historical mean: 104). Period 11 (Late April) shows no significant seasonal shift yet. The primary concern is the pipeline inventory. As noted in the carry-over insights, orders from Period 1 (145 units) and Period 3 (107 units) are confirmed lost shipments. These 252 units remain in the 'In-transit' count visible to the OR engine (463 - 252 = 211 actual units in transit from Period 10). Because the OR engine uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide orders, the over-reported pipeline will cause it to under-order or order nothing, leading to stockouts. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target that compensates for this 252-unit phantom inventory. Expected demand over review + lead time (1+2=3 periods) is ~312 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 252-unit error, I must inflate mu_hat to approximately 312 + 252 = 564. I will set mu_hat to 600 to ensure we capture enough safety stock given the recent supply chain volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P8, P10) confirm a lead time of 1-2 periods, aligning with the promised 2.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 64 in Period 11 that exhausted the 16 units of inventory. Demand has been declining from ~100 to ~64 over the last four periods as we exit early spring. Lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (Period 8 arrived in Period 10). The primary issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 644 units, which is heavily inflated by 252 units from lost shipments in Period 1 (145) and Period 3 (107). The pipeline currently physically contains Period 10 (204 units) and Period 11 (181 units), totaling 385 units. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to calculate the order size, it will subtract the ghost units (252) and potential arrivals from its target, leading to severe under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for L=2 (3 periods) based on recent mean demand (~80) and add the 252 lost units to the forecast to 'trick' the backend into ordering enough to cover the actual demand plus the expected arrival gap. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~240. Target base stock with safety should be ~320. Adding the 252 missing units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 572.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline inventory continues to be inflated by 252 units due to lost shipments in Period 1 and 3; demand is trending lower (~65-80 units/period) compared to earlier spring peaks (~100).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand for women's pyjama bottoms (Alex Jogger) had a spring peak around 100 units/period and has recently fluctuated between 64 and 98 units (mean of last 3 periods \u2248 80). The 'In-transit' count of 644 units is significantly inflated by 252 units from lost shipments in Period 1 (145) and Period 3 (107). Adjusting for these losses, the functional pipeline is 392 units (644 - 252). Despite this, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 12. Recent arrivals (Periods 8 and 10) have shown actual lead times of 1-2 periods, aligning with the promised L=2. For this period, I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current post-peak level (~86 units/period) and L=default. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, it will likely order nothing. Therefore, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to 'over-forecast' and force an order that compensates for the known 252-unit deficit in the pipeline, ensuring we recover from the current stockout.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is lightweight pyjama bottoms, which typically see a demand decrease as spring transitions into summer. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged ~78 units, significantly down from the earlier spring peak of ~100. The primary complication remains the 'In-transit' figure: the 252 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are definitively lost (over 10 periods late), but they still occupy the pipeline inventory in the OR engine's calculation. To compensate for this 252-unit phantom inventory and prevent the backend from under-ordering, I must set the 'mu_hat' (base stock target) to an explicit value that accounts for the phantom units plus desired safety stock. Expected demand for lead time + review period (L=2+1=3 periods) at ~78/period is 234 units. To offset 252 phantom units and maintain safety stock, I set mu_hat explicitly to 550. This forces the engine to order enough to cover actual upcoming demand despite the perceived pipeline. Lead time is stable at 2 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-20. The product is a lightweight womens jogger/pyjama bottom. Demand has transitioned from a spring peak (averaging ~100) to a more stable late-spring regime averaging ~78 over the last 5 periods (P10-P14: 77, 64, 98, 73, 83). The 'In-transit' count of 482 is heavily distorted by 252 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost/permanent failures. Subtracting these, the true pipeline is 230 units (204 from P10, 7 from P4, and 19 from P14). Shipment from P10 (204 units) is now 5 periods old (ordered P10, today is P15), significantly exceeding the recent actual lead time of 1-2 periods; it is likely delayed or lost like the earlier shipments, suggesting recurring supply instability. To protect against these supply failures and the current low on-hand inventory (25), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (averaging ~78/period) and 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for these lost pipeline units. Specifically, mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 78 = 234. I will set L=explicit=2 to match our promised lead time while monitoring for further failures.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in Period 10: mean ~78 (previously ~100). Period 10 shipment (204 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P10, today is P15), indicating a third major shipment failure totaling 456 units in 'zombie' pipeline inventory (P1=145, P3=107, P10=204).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from severe reliability issues. Total units in 'In-transit' are 482, but 456 of these are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (Period 1: 145, Period 3: 107, Period 10: 204). The Period 10 shipment (204 units) is now 5 periods overdue (ordered Period 10, now Period 16), fitting the pattern of previous lost shipments. This leaves only 26 'real' units in transit (Period 14 order of 19 units, plus 7 units from Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and face systemic stockouts. Demand for 'Alex Jogger' pyjama bottoms in May has averaged ~84 units over the last 3 periods (P13-P15). Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (482) to calculate orders, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this 'zombie' inventory. To force an order that covers our actual needs, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the 456 lost units plus the forecast for the next 3 weeks (L=2, so L+1=3). Forecast demand (3 * 84) + Lost units (456) = 708. This ensures the OR logic [min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] results in a positive order. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P8, P13) suggest that when shipments don't disappear, they arrive in 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Third major shipment loss confirmed: Period 10 order (204 units) is 5 periods overdue. Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory is now 456 units (P1: 145, P3: 107, P10: 204). Demand regime remains stable around 80-90 units/period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '536139006' (Alex Jogger) continues to face significant supply chain disruptions. Analysis of history confirms three likely lost shipments: P1 (145 units), P3 (107 units), and P10 (204 units). This results in 456 units of 'zombie' pipeline inventory. The current In-transit total of 742 units minus this 456 leaves an effective pipeline of 286 units (the P14 order of 19 units is also overdue, and the P16 order of 260 units is still within lead time). Demand has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 83 across the last 7 periods (P10-P16: 77, 64, 98, 73, 83, 94, 72). Given the extreme unreliability of supply (lead times of 1, 2, or infinite), I am setting L=2 (promised) but will use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to account for the inflated pipeline. To achieve a target base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) while the backend subtracts 742 units, I calculate: Target Base Stock = (1+2)*83 + (1.64 * sqrt(3) * 12) \u2248 283. To force the OR backend to order when it thinks pipeline is 742, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 742' results in a desirable order. However, since the OR engine is a black box regarding the exact inventory calculation it sees, I will use recent_N to reflect the current demand regime (N=7) and use the standard lead time, while acknowledging that 'In-transit' is misleading the backend's subtraction logic.

Carry-over insight: P14 order (19 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P14, today P17), potentially a fourth lost shipment. Total zombie inventory may be 475 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '536139006' (Alex Jogger) is currently in Period 18. Current on-hand inventory is 217. The 'In-transit' count of 482 is heavily compromised by 'zombie' pipeline inventory from lost shipments: P1 (145), P3 (107), P10 (204), and P14 (19), totaling 475 units that are unlikely to arrive. The backend OR logic subtracts the full 482 in-transit units from the base_stock calculation, but since 475 of those are lost, it will under-order or not order at all. To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Demand has stabilized late in the season (since Period 11) to an average of ~71 units per week (Period 17's drop to 43 suggests the post-spring decline). With the promised lead time L=2, the total demand to cover is (1+L)*71 = 213 units. However, to bypass the backend's subtraction of 482 units, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired base stock is ~213; with 482 units in transit being subtracted, I set mu_hat to 695 (213 + 482) to force the engine to recognize the need for stock despite the 'ghost' inventory. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the current demand variability. L is kept at 2 as recent successful arrivals (P16) confirm a 1-2 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed fourth lost shipment: Period 14 (19 units) has failed to arrive after 3 periods (Promised L=2). Total zombie pipeline inventory is 475 units (P1: 145, P3: 107, P10: 204, P14: 19). Demand regime since Period 13 shows signs of late-season deceleration, averaging ~72 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 17, 2019 (Period 19). The product is a lightweight pyjama bottom. Historically, demand peaked in Spring (March-May) around 90-110 units and has entered a significant seasonal decline in June, with the last two specific demand samples being 43 and 47 units. The carry-over insights confirm massive supply chain issues: 475 units in 'In-transit' are 'zombie' units (orders from P1, P3, P10, and P14) that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline inventory consists only of the Period 18 order (38 units), meaning the effective 'In-transit' for the OR engine's logic should be 45 units total (if including recent noise) rather than 520. However, the backend uses the raw 'In-transit' number (520). Because on-hand (170) + pipeline (520) = 690, the OR engine will see a massive surplus and not order anything unless the base stock exceeds 690. To compensate for the 475 lost units and target the recent demand regime (avg ~45), I will use 'explicit' values. My target base stock for L+1 (3 periods) at a mean of 45-50 is ~150 units. To force an order or maintain appropriate levels while bypassing the 475 unit ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the ghost units plus the desired service level. Targeting an effective base stock of ~150 atop the 475 loss = 625. I set mu_hat = 625 and sigma_hat = 60 to ensure we maintain safety stock despite the reported inflation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for June: avg dropped from ~80 to ~45 (-44%). Total zombie pipeline inventory confirmed at 475 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for the 'Alex Jogger' has entered a low-season regime in June, shifting from ~80 units/period to approximately 42 units/period (average of P17-P19). The pipeline inventory remains severely distorted by four confirmed 'zombie' shipments: P1 (145), P3 (107), P10 (204), and P14 (19), totaling 475 missing units. While official 'In-transit' shows 516 units, actual reliable pipeline inventory is only 41 units (516 - 475). With On-hand inventory at 173 units and current demand low (~42), we are well-covered for the lead time (L=2) and review period. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 141 (calculated as 47 units/period * (2+1) periods) to reflect the recent demand deceleration and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering based on spring data. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the lower volatility in this new regime. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P16, P18) have been 1 period, but the promised 2 is safer given the history of losses.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/1. The product is a lightweight pyjama bottom, which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand drop as we move into the peak of summer (July). The demand regime has shifted from approximately 80 units/period to an average of 38 units over the last 4 periods (P17-P20). In-transit inventory (516 units) includes 475 units of confirmed 'zombie' lost shipments (P1: 145, P3: 107, P10: 204, P14: 19). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 41 units (516 - 475). Total effective inventory (On-hand 146 + Effective In-transit 41) is 187 units. At the current demand rate of ~40 units/period, this covers more than 4 periods of supply (L+1 = 3). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture this low-season regime and keep sigma_hat default to maintain a buffer for potential volatility. Effective L is 2. The OR engine will subtract the 516 'In-transit' from the base stock; since 187 (or even 187 - zombie) is likely less than the 'In-transit' reported, the engine will order 0, which is desired given the high on-hand stock and low summer demand.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed low-season: average dropped to ~38 units/period (P17-P20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight pyjama bottom, currently in the July low-season (mid-summer). Recent demand (P17-P21) has stabilized at a significantly lower level, averaging 38.4 units per period, compared to the spring average of ~80-100. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this lower July regime. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 516 units is heavily inflated by 'zombie' shipments that are confirmed lost: Period 1 (145), Period 3 (107), Period 10 (204), and Period 14 (19), totaling 475 units. The actual active pipeline is 41 units (516 - 475), which primarily consists of the Period 19 order (34 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 106 units. Given the low demand (~38/period) and 2-period lead time, 106 units covers nearly 3 periods of demand (106 / 38 \u2248 2.8 periods). This suggests we are already at or near the target base stock. I will use the 'explicit' method for L to account for the frequent shipment losses by setting it slightly higher than promised (L=3), ensuring the OR backend targets enough safety stock to handle the high risk of supply failure, while keeping mu_hat grounded in the recent low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $434.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '536139006' (Alex Jogger) is currently in a low-demand summer regime (July), with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 34 units (P18-P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 79 units, which covers over 2 periods of expected demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 516 units is heavily inflated by 475 units of confirmed 'zombie' or lost shipments (P1: 145, P3: 107, P10: 204, P14: 19). Adjusting for these losses, the true pipeline inventory is 41 units (516 - 475), which is the order from P19. Since on-hand + true pipeline (79+41=120) covers approximately 3.5 weeks of low-season demand, no new order is necessary. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 516 units as healthy pipeline and stopping all ordering forever, I am keeping L at default (2) but setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent July demand regime (~34 units/period) to maintain a lean stock level while acknowledging the seasonal drop.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Historical demand for July (Periods 21-23) has stabilized at a low-season average of approximately 38 units per week (40, 27, 48), confirming the mid-summer demand drop for these pyjama bottoms. The 'In-transit' figure of 516 units is severely compromised by 'zombie' inventory: shipments from P1 (145), P3 (107), P10 (204), and P14 (19) have never arrived and are now confirmed lost. These 475 'zombie' units must be accounted for because the OR backend ignores lost shipments and assumes they will still arrive. Subtracting 475 from 516 leaves an actual pipeline of 41 units (likely the P19 order). With on-hand inventory at 31 and an actual pipeline of 41, total real inventory is 72 units. At a demand of ~38/week, and a promised lead time of 2, the desired base stock (covering L+1=3 periods) should be around 114 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated pipeline, I will set mu_hat significantly higher than the current mean to bridge the 475-unit gap, ensuring the system targets a total inventory position that compensates for the lost stock. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current low-season demand regime (~38 avg) but will leverage the OR engine's logic. Actually, to maintain precision and manage the zombie stock, I will use 'explicit' values to target the net needed units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Alex Jogger', a lightweight pyjama bottom, currently in late July. Demand dropped from ~80 units/period to ~38 units/period starting in June (Period 17), consistent with it being a seasonal summer low for this nightwear category. Period 24 demand was 32 units, and we are currently stockout (ending on-hand 0). Pipeline inventory is highly inflated by 475 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P1: 145, P3: 107, P10: 204, P14: 19). The current 'In-transit' of 588 units includes these 475 units plus the valid orders from P19 (34 units, now 6 periods overdue and likely lost) and P24 (72 units). Excluding all likely lost shipments, the effective pipeline is 72 units. Lead times for successful arrivals (P4, P8, P10, P13, P17, P19) have been 1-2 periods. I set L to default (2), mu_hat to 120 (approx 40 units/period for 3 periods), and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent variance and the risk of further stockouts during the low-demand plateau.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Period 19 shipment (34 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total zombie pipeline inventory is 509 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19). Demand regime holds at ~35-40 units/period through July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, following a low-season demand regime observed through June and July (avg ~38 units/period). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 588 units is heavily inflated by 'zombie' pipeline inventory from lost shipments: P1 (145), P3 (107), P10 (204), P14 (19), and P19 (34), totaling 509 units. Excluding these failures, the true active pipeline is only 79 units (P24 order of 72 units + P4 leftovers). Since the backend OR logic subtracts the full 588 units from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 509-unit deficit. Calculation: Target base_stock (for (1+L)=3 periods) is ~120 units. To trigger a corrective order from the backend which sees 588 units in transit, mu_hat must be set to approximately 588 + desired buffer. However, the OR backend also uses a cap based on mu_hat. To ensure supply stabilizes for the August transition while accounting for the massive pipeline error, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer against the lost units while reflecting current demand levels (approx 40 units/period). L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P16, P18) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total of 509 'zombie' units in pipeline (lost shipments: P1, P3, P10, P14, P19). Demand regime for August remains low (~40 units/period).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 27 (mid-August). Demand for this SKU has remained in a low-season regime throughout the summer (July/August), averaging approximately 43 units per period. The supply chain has experienced significant failures, with 509 units in 'zombie' pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19) that have never arrived. Current In-transit is 588, meaning only 79 units (from P24) are actually likely to arrive. With 0 on-hand inventory, we need to restock for the current low-demand period and incoming Fall season. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current demand mean (~43) and variance. Lead time is set to default (2), but I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the inflated pipeline inventory. I need to target a base stock covering L+1 periods (3 periods * 43 units \u2248 130). However, the OR backend subtracts the (inflated) pipeline. Since effective pipeline is 79 and zombie is 509, I will calculate mu_hat strategically: to get an order of ~60-80 units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 509 zombie units. Target base stock = 600. Using explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to deal with the pipeline distortion.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019/08/19), we are seeing common seasonal behavior for nightwear: a late-summer uptick in demand (P27 demand: 91 units) following a low-July period (~40 units/period). The 'In-transit' figure of 683 units is highly distorted by historical lost shipments: P1 (145), P3 (107), P10 (204), P14 (19), and P19 (34), totaling 509 'zombie' units. Additionally, recent orders from P24 (72 units) and P27 (95 units) are currently in-flight. Subtracting the 509 lost units from our total inventory (On-hand: 0 + In-transit: 683 - Lost: 509) leaves an effective inventory of 174 units. Given the recent demand spike, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the shift from the low-summer trough to the current higher demand level (averaging ~56 over the last 4 visible periods, with the most recent sample at 91). Promoting a lead time of 2 periods, the OR engine will target covering demand for 3 periods. The current effective inventory (174) vs expected demand over 3 periods (~170-200) suggests a lean position, so I will maintain 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we account for the late-August recovery while the zombie inventory is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total confirmed 'zombie' units in pipeline is 509 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19). Demand regime in late August (P27) shows a significant recovery to 91 units, up from July average of ~40.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 29 (late August). Historical data shows a clear demand recovery starting Period 27 (demand = 91 and 82), signaling the transition from low-season July (avg ~38) to a higher late-summer/pre-autumn regime. The total 'In-transit' figure of 683 is heavily distorted by 509 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19). The true functional pipeline is 174 units (P24: 72, P27: 95, P28: 7). However, because the backend OR engine subtracts the full 683 from its base stock calculation, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. To ensure we actually place an order to cover the current demand (avg ~86) and rebuild stock (on-hand is 0), mu_hat is set to 800. This value is calculated to exceed the zombie inventory (509) plus (1+L) periods of current demand (~260), forcing a positive order. Sigma is increased to 30 to account for higher volatility during this demand transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery confirmed in late August (P27-P28), increasing from ~40 to ~85 units/period. Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains 509 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 30 (2019/9/2). Demand has recently recovered from a summer low (~40 units/period) to a higher late-summer/early-autumn regime. The average demand across P27-P29 is approximately 76 units, confirming the recovery noted in the Carry-Over Insights. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 850 units, but it contains 509 units of 'zombie' pipeline inventory from lost shipments (P1: 145, P3: 107, P10: 204, P14: 19, P19: 34), meaning the actual viable in-transit inventory is 341 units (P24: 72, P27: 95, P29: 167). On-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, we must cover at least 3 periods of demand (L+1). Given the demand regime shift to ~76-85 units, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P27-P29) to capture this upward movement. We continue to monitor if the recent orders (P24, P27) will arrive as expected, as supply reliability has been inconsistent. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat correctly weights the current recovery.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 31 (Sept 9). Analyzing the demand history, we saw a clear recovery starting around Period 27/28 (late August), moving from a summer low of ~40 units/period to current levels of ~85 units/period (last 4 weeks: 91, 82, 54, 90). The average for this new regime is ~79.25. The supply chain remains problematic: we have identified 509 'zombie' units in the pipeline that will never arrive (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19). The Period 29 order (167 units) is expected to arrive soon (promised L=2). Since the backend OR uses the over-reported 'In-transit' figure (755 units), it sees 755 physical units, but only 755 - 509 = 246 units are actually likely to arrive. To compensate for the 'zombie' units and ensure the base stock calculation triggers an actual order, I will use an 'explicit' L to slightly pad the requirement and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, I will target the current regime mean of ~80. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the order formula is (base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 509 unit phantom inventory. However, the OR backend also caps orders based on mu_hat. To ensure a robust order that covers the current demand spike and accounts for the missing 509 units, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects (1+L) * 80 plus a correction for the 'missing' 509 units to force the backend to realize we are under-stocked. Looking at the logic, the most direct way to get the backend to order is to set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - pipeline) is positive. Estimated required base stock to cover 3 periods at 80 units plus 509 missing units is ~750. Setting mu_hat to 750 (explicit) and L to 2.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed at ~80 units/period, consistent with late August recovery. Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains 509 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward in late August and September, now averaging approximately 83 units per period (P27-P31: 91, 82, 54, 90, 97). This coincides with our transition into autumn (mid-September), which is a seasonally strong period for loungewear/pyjamas. I am forecasting based on this recent 5-period average (83). The 'In-transit' figure (796) is heavily distorted by 509 'zombie' units from historical lost shipments (P1: 145, P3: 107, P10: 204, P14: 19, P19: 34), which will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must account for this by providing an 'explicit' mu_hat that effectively bypasses the inflated pipeline. The logic: Target Stock (Base Stock) = (1+L) * Forecast + Safety Stock. With L=2 (promised), target stock should cover 3 periods (~249 units plus safety). Since the OR engine sees 796 in transit, it will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 509 unit 'ghost' inventory. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 83 + 509 = 758 to force the math to recognize current demand needs despite the zombie units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the late-August recovery, with recent demand samples (P30-P32) averaging 89.6 units per week. This aligns with the September recovery identified in previous insights. Currenly, on-hand inventory is 0 and the In-transit pipeline of 766 units is heavily distorted by 509 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19). The valid pipeline inventory is 257 units (766 - 509), consisting of orders from P29 (167), P31 (already arrived in P32 but likely still in reporting transition), and P32 (11). Lead times has been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will continue to use the calculated average to buffer this uncertainty. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P28-P32) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~80-90 units, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for these higher sales while the OR engine manages the pipeline correction.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Alex Jogger' has surged significantly in late September, with Period 33 recording a demand of 169 units, a sharp increase from the previous regime of ~85. This suggests a transition into a peak autumn/winter season. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 766 is heavily inflated by 509 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19). Additionally, the P29 order (167 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, and the P32 order (11 units) is 2 periods old. To counter the OR backend's perception of high pipeline inventory, I am using 'explicit' L and mu_hat. I estimate L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat based on the new demand level (avg of P30-P33 is ~110, but P33 was 169). I will forecast a mu_hat of 360 (3 periods * 120 units/period) to trigger an order that bypasses the zombie inventory cap, aiming to restore on-hand stock for the high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: P29 order (167 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods (Promised L=2). Total confirmed 'zombie' pipeline inventory increased to 676 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Demand regime shift detected in late September (P33): demand spiked to 169 units, indicating early winter seasonal peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Alex Jogger' has entered a winter seasonal peak, with a dramatic spike to 169 units in Period 33, followed by 98 in Period 34. The average demand over the last two periods (~133) is significantly higher than the previous regime (~80). The product (pyjama bottoms) is highly sensitive to the cooling temperatures of October. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 766 units is severely compromised by 676 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Effectively, there are zero units reliably in transit and zero units on hand, leading to continuous stockouts. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (including the peak) and use explicit sigma_hat to account for this seasonal volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the varied actual lead times (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed total 'zombie' pipeline inventory of 676 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Ongoing stockouts since P33 due to shipment failures and seasonal demand spike (~133 units/period avg P33-P34).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 536139006 (Alex Jogger) is experiencing a high-demand seasonal peak typical for nightwear in mid-October. Recent demand (P33-P35) has averaged ~125 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a total of 676 'zombie' units in the pipeline that are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). These lost units inflate the apparent 'In-transit' to 755, when the actual functional pipeline is only 79 units (755 - 676). Actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To address this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1=3) at the current high-demand rate of ~125-135 units/period. Setting mu_hat to 405 (135 * 3) and a high sigma_hat will trigger the OR backend to order sufficient stock to overcome the 'zombie' inventory drag and satisfy the seasonal spike.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's pyjama bottom, entering the peak winter/indoor season in late October. Demand has stabilized into a high-season regime, averaging ~120 units/period over the last four periods (P33-P36). Supply reliability remains a critical issue; the current 'In-transit' of 755 units is heavily inflated by 676 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Subtracting these leaves only 79 units of 'real' pipeline inventory (likely from recent small adjustments or the tail of P32). Since on-hand is 0 and real pipeline is insufficient to meet the seasonal mean of 120 (plus lead time coverage), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 480 (representing 4 periods of demand at a rate of 120/period: L+1 plus safety cushion) to trigger a robust reorder. This level targets a base stock that compensates for the massive 'zombie' inventory block preventing the OR backend from ordering. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: P33-P36 demand regime confirmed at ~120 units/period (up from ~80), reflecting winter seasonality for nightwear. Total zombie pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 676 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we are entering the peak winter season for nightwear (Alex Jogger). Demand has surged over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) with an average of 128.8 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~80. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the 'In-transit' count of 755 is heavily inflated by 676 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Actual effective pipeline inventory is only 79 units (755 - 676). Since the OR backend uses the full In-transit figure, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual predicted demand to force an order that compensates for the 676-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock + Zombie Offset. With L=2 and Expected Demand \u2248 130, required Base Stock is roughly (130 * 3) + 100 (SS) + 676 = 1166. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value near this target to ensure the backend generates a sufficient order to cover the current stockout and the coming peak season despite the 'pipeline' noise.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand winter seasonal peak for pyjama bottoms, with recent demand (P33-P38) averaging approximately 134 units/period, significantly higher than the previous autumn average of 80. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced another stockout. The 'In-transit' figure of 1190 is misleading because it includes 676 'zombie' units from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Subtracting these, the true pipeline is 514 units (the P38 order of 435 plus small previous residuals), which is barely enough to cover the forecasted demand over the review + lead time (L+1=3). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this seasonal spike despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the winter regime change, and setting lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (1-3 periods). These parameters aim to maintain a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) during the peak period.

Carry-over insight: Winter seasonal peak confirmed starting P33: demand shifted from ~80 to ~134 units/period (+67%). Total confirmed 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains 676 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the winter seasonal peak for nightwear (Alex Jogger), with a detected demand shift around Period 33. The average demand for the last seven periods (P33-P39) is approximately 127.5 units, significantly higher than the previous regime (~80). The high 'In-transit' figure of 1190 is heavily distorted by 676 units of confirmed 'zombie' inventory (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 10, 14, 19, and 29) that will never arrive. Adjusting for these, the true pipeline is approximately 514 units (the P38 order of 435 units and the P24 order of 72 units which is now 16 periods overdue and likely also lost, though not yet added to the zombie total). Since the OR backend cannot distinguish between real and zombie inventory, I must set the mu_hat explicitly high to force an order that compensates for the 'ghost' stock and meets current high demand. I estimate demand at 130 per period. For L=2, mu_hat = (1+L)*130 = 390. However, to bypass the backend's deduction of the 676 zombie units, I will set mu_hat to 390 + 676 = 1066. This ensures the base stock calculation (before the z-score) is high enough to generate an order despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent volatility in the peak season.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Alex Jogger (Womens Nightwear), which is currently in its peak winter season (November). Demand shifted significantly in late September (Period 33) from ~80 units to an average of ~130 units/period. The most recent demand (P40) was 120 units. Crucially, the 'In-transit' inventory of 1190 units is heavily inflated by 676 units of confirmed 'zombie' or lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Subtracting these, the true pipeline is approximately 514 units, which corresponds to the large order of 435 units placed in Period 38 and smaller residuals. Since P38 was ordered with a promised lead time of 2, it is expected to arrive during Period 40 or 41. We set L to 'calculate' to account for recent variability (1-3 periods). mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the winter regime since P33) to capture the peak demand of ~130 units/period over the 3-period lead-time + review cycle. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to account for the increased volatility during this peak season. These parameters will ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock sufficient to cover the remaining cold season demand once the Period 38 shipment arrives.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, peaking in winter seasonality for nightwear. Demand has been consistently strong since Period 33, averaging ~127 units/period over the last 9 weeks. The 'In-transit' figure of 1190 is heavily distorted by 676 units of 'zombie' pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Subtracting these lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 514 units. Most notably, the large order from P38 (435 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived; however, history shows lead times for this SKU are volatile (drifting between 1 and 3 periods). Given the high demand and zero on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the winter surge (approx 127 units/period * (2+1) = 381). I will set L to explicit 3 to account for the observed delays in recent successful and pending deliveries, helping the OR engine trigger an order that compensates for the massive backlog while being mindful of the actual 514 units in transit.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the winter seasonal peak for nightwear (Alex Jogger), evidenced by a massive demand spike in Period 42 (355 units), likely corresponding to Black Friday or early December shopping. The average demand since Period 33 has shifted from ~80 to ~135 units, but the last period shows extreme volatility. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1190 units is severely inflated by 'zombie' shipments from P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, and P29, totaling 676 units. Actual usable pipeline inventory is only 514 (the P38 order of 435 units plus small residual logic). Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing a seasonal peak, I must set the OR parameters to trigger a significant reorder despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat because the OR engine's 'default' or 'recent_N' would be misled by the zombie inventory and the extreme P42 outlier. I am forecasting a mean of 180 units per period for the Dec/Jan peak to ensure availability, and calculating mu_hat as (1+L)*180 = 540. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance, which has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Extreme demand spike of 355 units (Black Friday/Holiday effect) confirmed. Winter demand regime (P33-P42) now averages ~155 units/period. Total zombie pipeline inventory remains 676 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, entering the final stages of the winter seasonal peak (December). Historical data shows a winter regime starting around P33, with demand averaging ~155 units/period (P33-P43), including an extreme spike of 355 in P42 (Black Friday). The current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline inventory is listed as 1190 units. However, 676 of these units are confirmed 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). A large order of 435 units was placed in P38 (6 periods ago) and has not arrived; given the history of failures, this may also be delayed or lost, but since L=2 is promised, it is mathematically treated as in-transit. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the winter regime (P33-P43) which averages 154.36 units. For sigma_hat, I'll use the same window to capture the high volatility seen in the holiday spike. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to account for recent arrival delays like P32's 3-period lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak winter/holiday demand regime for women's pyjama bottoms. The recent demand (P42-P44) has been exceptionally high, averaging 253 units per period due to the holiday season (Black Friday through mid-December). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been in a stockout state for multiple periods. The In-transit inventory is listed as 1190 units, but this includes 676 'zombie' units from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29). Subtracting these, the true active pipeline is 514 units (from the P38 order of 435 units and other recent small adjustments). This P38 order is now 7 periods old (ordered P38, today is P45) and is significantly overdue compared to the promised lead time of 2. Given the game is near its end (Period 47) and we have a large active order (435 units) potentially arriving any moment, I will set parameters to ensure we capture the remaining seasonal demand while acknowledging the supply delay. mu_hat is set to reflect the higher winter mean of ~155 units/period (P33-P44), as the extreme spike to 355 was a outlier peak. L is set to 'calculate' to account for historical variability, but mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent data to stay responsive to the high-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand (P42-P44) averaged 253 units per period, while the broader winter regime (P33-P44) averages ~155 units. Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory remains 676 units. Significant delay observed for the P38 order (435 units), now 5 periods overdue.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the winter seasonal peak for pajamas (Period 46, Dec 23). Historical data (P42-P44) shows a peak demand average of ~250 units, though the most recent period (P45) saw a drop to 132. The broader winter regime (P33-P45) averages ~155 units. A significant risk is the 1190 units 'In-transit', which includes 676 'zombie' units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29) that will never arrive. Additionally, the order from P38 (435 units) is now 8 periods overdue and likely lost. The total confirmed zombie inventory is the original 676 plus the likely lost P38 (435), totaling 1111 units. This leaves only ~79 units (from P32 or similar adjustments, though effectively all recent large orders have failed). Given the date (Dec 23), we expect demand to remain high for 1-2 more weeks before the post-holiday drop. I will set mu_hat to 155 (winter average) to ensure we cover the remaining peak, while signaling to the backend that most pipeline inventory is non-existent by using a high mu_hat. Since we have 0 on-hand and recent orders are failing or severely delayed, I will use an explicit L of 2 but anticipate that the OR backend needs to place a fresh order to overcome the recorded pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Order from Period 38 (435 units) is 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total 'zombie' pipeline inventory is now 1111 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29, P38). Inventory levels are critically low due to repeated supply failures during peak season.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). The product is 'Alex Jogger' (Nightwear), which has just completed its peak winter/holiday season. Demand in the most recent periods (P45-P46) has moderated to 132 and 115 units, compared to the Black Friday spike of 355. Crucially, the supply chain has catastrophically failed. The 'In-transit' figure of 1190 is composed entirely of 'zombie' units (lost orders: P1, P3, P10, P14, P19, P29, P38). Period 38 (435 units) is now 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. With 0 on-hand inventory and the backend believing there is a massive pipeline, it will not order unless I intervene via explicit parameters. Demand is expected to remain around 100-120 units post-holiday before settling into the early spring regime. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at a conservative post-peak rate of 110 units/period (total 330) and use explicit L to override the engine's potentially skewed logic. Sigma remains high due to recent extreme volatility.
