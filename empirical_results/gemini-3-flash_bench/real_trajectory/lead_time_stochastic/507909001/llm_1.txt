We are approaching February 14th (Valentine's Day), which may slightly influence demand, but generally, this item feels like a steady-state office wear product. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods (L=2) and the current period (N=1), my order must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (total 3 periods) because an order placed now arrives in Period 3's arrival phase to satisfy demand in Periods 3 and beyond. Based on the historical average of 145, I expect 3 weeks of demand to be roughly 435 units. I currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit.

According to the timeline, an order placed in P1 should arrive in P3 resolution and be visible now (P4 start). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0.

Regarding Lead Time: The P2 order arrived in L=2 (P4 conclude), P1 is confirmed lost, P3 and P4 orders (800 units total) are missing/overdue (P3 was due P5 conclude, P4 was due P6 conclude). Surprisingly, the P5 order arrived early in L=1 (P6 conclude). This indicates highly volatile lead times or potential supplier unreliability. Current Inventory Status: On-hand is 177. In-transit is 1500 (P3: 450, P4: 350, P6: 250, plus the new P6 order? Wait, history shows in-transit is 1500 - this includes the massive orders from P3/P4 that are currently overdue). Pipeline: P3 (450) and P4 (350) are overdue; if they arrive, we will be overstocked. However, if they are lost like P1, we are at risk.

There is an 'active' pipeline consisting of orders from P34 (450 units) and P36 (50 units), totaling 500 units, which are expected to arrive imminently based on the current lead time of 2-3 periods. All older in-transit units (approx. 2350) are confirmed lost based on historical performance. Given that current inventory (606) plus reliable in-transit (500) equals 1106 units, and the expected demand for the next 3 periods is approximately 390-450 units (L+1 coverage), we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand. The holding cost is $1.00/unit compared to a profit of $4.00/unit, so minimizing holding costs for excess inventory is a priority. No new order is needed this period as existing stock and pipeline cover nearly 8 periods of current demand.",
