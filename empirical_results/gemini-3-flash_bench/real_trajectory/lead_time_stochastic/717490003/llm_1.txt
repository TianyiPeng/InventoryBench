{
  "rationale": "For SKU 717490003 (Cat Tee), the historical demand shows a clear declining trend from high mid-January levels (~48/week) to much lower early February levels (~14.5/week). This decline reflects a post-holiday/early-year cooling period for jersey basics. The current date is February 11, 2019. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods and a holding cost equal to profit ($1.0), the inventory strategy must be cautious to avoid excess stock. I estimate demand for the next few periods (P1, P2, P3) to stabilize around the recent mean of 15 units per week. To cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need approximately 45 units. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, I will order 45 units to establish a baseline pipeline while minimizing potential holding costs if demand remains low.",

Recent periods show a significant spike (Period 3: 79, Period 6: 122), suggesting a volatile but increasing trend as Spring progresses. Expected demand for P7-P10 is likely higher than the original average of ~45; I will estimate demand around 80-100 units/period to account for the spring uptick and recent volatility. Lead Time: P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). P5 order arrived in P6 (L=1). P1, P3, and P4 orders (45, 35, 150) are missing/overdue. P1 (ordered P1, expected P3) is definitively lost.

The most recent demand (P12) was 160 units, suggesting a potential early May surge or sustained spring interest. Lead Time & Supply: The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, orders from P1, P3, and P4 never arrived, suggesting a significant loss rate. However, recent orders from P8 and P9 arrived reliably. Current Pipeline: On-hand inventory is 94 units. We have 330 units in-transit (P10: 100 units, P11: 0, P12: 0). The P10 order is expected to arrive during Period 13 resolution (visible in P14). Inventory Calculation: Starting OH (94) is likely insufficient for P13 demand if the P12 trend (160) continues. However, the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), making overstocking extremely punitive. We expect the 100 units from P10 to arrive this period. Total inventory position (94 OH + 100 expected arrival + 0 in-transit for P11/P12) = 194 units. Order Logic: To cover demand for the lead time window (P13, P14, P15) and account for the high cost of holding, I will place an order that ensures we don't stock out while monitoring the arrival of the P10 shipment. Since Profit=Holding Cost, the Newsvendor logic suggests a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning we should aim for the median demand. Forecasted demand is ~100/period. Target inventory for P13-P15 is ~300.

Historical demand shows a cooling trend from the July peak (~175+ average) to an August baseline (~80-100 units/week). Period 26 demand was 82, confirming this cooling trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (273 units), providing a ~3-week buffer against current demand levels. Pipeline assessment: The P23 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods (slight delay), confirming that although reliability has improved since early-game losses, lead times are still volatile (1-3 periods). In-transit inventory is 1090 units; however, a large portion (630 units) consists of orders from P13, P14, P17, P18, and P19 which are now 8-14 periods old and are confirmed lost. The 'active' pipeline includes P24 (150), P25 (100), and P26 (100). Total reliable stock + active pipeline = 273 (on-hand) + 350 (active in-transit) = 623 units. With demand cooling to ~80-90 units/week, this covers approximately 7 weeks of demand.

Historical data shows demand has dropped significantly from a summer peak of ~150 units/week to a very low baseline of ~10-15 units/week in November. Current on-hand inventory is 0. However, the 'In-transit' balance of 1200 units is highly problematic. No shipments have arrived since Period 27 (August), meaning every order placed before Period 41 (totaling 990 units) is statistically likely to be lost or indefinitely delayed given the promised lead time of 2 periods. In Period 41, an order of 210 units was placed. Given the current demand (12 units in P41) and the likely loss of older in-transit stock, I need to ensure there is enough inventory to meet this low demand while hedging against further shipment losses. The P41 order of 210 units is already massive relative to current demand (~17x weekly demand). Adding more to the erratic pipeline would risk high holding costs if multiple shipments suddenly arrive. I will hold further orders this period to assess if the P41 shipment arrives and to avoid over-committing to a failing supply chain.",

With 0 on-hand inventory and the P41 order expected to arrive this period (covering demand for Period 43 and several weeks beyond), no further orders are necessary. The total in-transit quantity of 1200 units consists of the P41 order (210) plus legacy lost orders that never cleared the system (990).

Regarding the supply chain, the P41 order of 210 units arrived on time (L=2), confirming that while the 990 units from earlier in the year are definitely lost, the supplier is currently functional. However, because on-hand inventory (203) already covers approximately 10-15 weeks of the current winter demand, adding any more units would only accumulate holding costs without increasing sales potential before the game ends in Period 47.",
