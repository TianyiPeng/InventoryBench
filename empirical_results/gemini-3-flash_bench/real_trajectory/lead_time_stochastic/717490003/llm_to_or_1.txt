Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11/Feb 11). The SKU is a 'Cat Tee' (Jersey T-shirt), which likely sees standard baseline demand with potential spring seasonality. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a significant downward trend: 49, 47, 19, 15, 14. This suggests an end to a peak or a post-holiday decline. The mean of all samples is 28.8, but the last three samples average 16. On-hand and in-transit are both 0. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the backend should use a base stock policy covering (2+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~16) rather than the earlier higher values, avoiding overstocking. For Lead Time, I will use the default promised value of 2 as no historical arrival data exists yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). Looking at the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), we see a clear downward trend: 49, 47, 19, 15, 14. This suggests a post-holiday/early-year demand drop for this basic Jersey T-shirt. The Period 1 demand was 21 units, which is slightly higher than the last two weeks of Jan/early Feb, but significantly lower than the early Jan peak. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 21 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1). The promised lead time is 2, so we expect the Period 1 order to arrive in Period 3 (visible in Period 4). In Period 1, we couldn't satisfy any demand because inventory was 0. Given the demand regime appears to have stabilized at a lower level (~15-21 units), I will use the last 4 samples (including Period 1's realized demand) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. L is set to default as we have no evidence yet of lead time deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt', which typically shows stable demand but can be subject to seasonal dips in late winter. Historical demand from early Jan to early Feb showed a decline: 49, 47, 19, 15, 14. More recently, in Period 1 and 2, observed demand was 21 and 43. The significant increase in Period 2 suggests a possible rebound or volatility. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 44 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order (21 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the next conclude message. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent range (14, 21, 43 etc.) while acknowledging the higher recent volatility. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' to ensure the OR backend accounts for the current demand swing. Lead time remains at the default (promised = 2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical demand data and recent performance show a significant upward trend since early February. Samples from Jan/early Feb were low (14-19), but the last three periods (Feb 11, 18, 25) saw demands of 21, 43, and 79 respectively. This represents a clear regime shift or seasonal ramp-up for jersey t-shirts as spring approaches. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had stockouts for the past three weeks. In-transit inventory is 68 units (orders from P1, P2, P3: 21+23+24). Since the promised lead time is 2, the P1 order should arrive during P3 resolution (visible in P3 conclude) and the P2 order during P4 resolution. However, the P3 conclude shows 0 arrivals, suggesting the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there are delays. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to account for this observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (averaging 47.6 per week). mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) periods, so 4 * 47.6 = 190.4. Because of the aggressive stockout situation and high week-over-week growth (21->43->79), I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 220 and sigma_hat at 60 to ensure the base stock is high enough to recover from current backlogs and handle the upward momentum.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-18: demand increased from stable low (~15) to 43, then 79. Lead time is confirmed > 2 periods as P1 order (placed 2019-02-11) did not arrive by P3 conclude.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a basic jersey t-shirt. Previous demand was low (approx 15-20), but surged to 43, 79, and then 39 over the last three periods, indicating a seasonal shift or regime change as we move into March. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In Period 4 conclude, we saw the P2 order arrive with a lead time of 2 periods (arrived Period 4, ordered Period 2). However, the P1 order (ordered 2019-02-11) is still missing - it should have arrived in Period 3 conclude or Period 4 conclude if lead time was 2. This suggests either a lost shipment for P1 or high variability in lead times. Given the demand jump (avg ~54 over last 3 periods) compared to the initial samples (~29 mean), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this higher demand regime. Sigma is also elevated, so I'll use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat. Since one order arrived at L=2 but another is missing, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend start incorporating observed lead times, but keep a close eye on the missing P1 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility: P2 arrived in 2 periods, but P1 shipment (ordered 2019-02-11) is confirmed missing/lost as of P5. Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~25 to ~54 (+115%) starting late February.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a Divided Basics T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a clear demand shift: Periods 1-4 demand was [21, 43, 79, 39], and Period 5 was 48. The mean of the last 4 periods (N=4) is 52.25. The Period 1 order (21 units) is officially lost as it has surpassed the 2-period lead time significantly without arriving (it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4). Period 2 arrived on time (L=2). Period 3 order (24 units) was expected in Period 5 but didn't arrive, suggesting lead time might be stretching or that shipment is also delayed/lost. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P3 (24), P4 (105), and P5 (11). To account for the lost P1 order and the higher demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the shift to ~52 units/week. L is set to explicit=3 to provide a buffer for recent delivery instability and the fact that the P3 order is already late.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (21 units) confirmed lost. P3 order (24 units) is late (expected P5, not arrived). Sustained demand increase from initial ~15 units to a new mean of ~52 units (+240%) confirmed over the last 4 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is a 'Cat Tee' (T-shirt), with demand showing a clear upward trend as we enter spring (Period 6 demand spiked to 122). Historical demand before the game was ~20-30, but the last 5 periods show a mean of ~66 (43+79+39+48+122 / 5). The Period 6 spike of 122 is significant. Lead time is volatile: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived early in 1 period, but P1 is lost and P3 (ordered P3, promised P5) is still missing as of P6 conclude, suggesting it is also likely lost. P4 order (105 units) should arrive during Period 6 or 7. Stockouts have been persistent (ending inventory is 0 for all periods). To recover and meet the rising seasonal demand, I will set L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to an explicit value of 240 (3 periods * 80 units/period) to account for the increasing trend and the stockout-suppressed demand history, and sigma_hat to an explicit 100 to handle the high volatility (39 to 122 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Mean demand over last 4 periods reached ~72, with a significant peak of 122 in P6 likely due to spring seasonality. P1 and P3 orders (total 45 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, impacting pipeline inventory reliability.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/04/01. The product is a Cat Tee (T-shirt), and we are entering the peak spring season. Historical demand has surged from ~15 units to 148 units in Period 7 (Date: 2019/3/25). The last 4 periods (P4-P7) show demand of 39, 48, 122, and 148, with a mean of 89.25 units. The P1 order (21 units) and P3 order (24 units) are definitively lost as they are far beyond the promised 2-period lead time. P4 (105 units), P6 (48 units), and P7 (42 units) are currently in-transit (total 195 units, excluding lost shipments). Lead times have been inconsistent (P2=2 periods, P5=1 period, P1/P3 lost). Given the steep upward trend and seasonality, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*120 to provide a buffer for the expected peak, and use an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to account for high volatility and stockout risk during this growth phase. I will assume the promised lead time of 2 for L to allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly at Period 7 (2019/3/25), reaching 148 units. 4-period moving average is now 89.25 (+70% vs previous window). Seasonal peak for 'T-shirt in soft jersey' is actively occurring.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/08), the product 'T-shirt in soft jersey' is experiencing a strong upward seasonal trend typical for spring. Demand has accelerated significantly: the last four periods show values of 48, 122, 148, and 108. The mean demand over the last four periods is 106.5 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~15-20 units. Lead times have been volatile (1-2 periods), and critical shipments (P1, P3) are confirmed lost, totaling 45 units. These losses artificially inflate the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, because the backend still counts them as in-transit. With on-hand inventory consistently hitting zero and causing stockouts, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers future demand and compensates for these 'phantom' units in-transit. Calculated for L=2: mu_hat = (1+2) * 106.5 = 319.5; adjusting for ~45 lost units = 364.5. I will set mu_hat to 365 to ensure the engine places orders despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma is calculated using recent volatility to protect against further demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand acceleration confirmed: 4-period mean demand is now 106.5 units (+500% vs baseline). Lead time volatility persists between 1-2 periods. Pipeline accounting requires manual compensation for 45 units lost in P1 and P3.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019/4/15). The SKU 'T-shirt in soft jersey' is in a high-demand spring seasonal regime. Recent demand fluctuates significantly (148, 108, 60), but the 4-period average remains high (~110). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 365 units in transit. However, history confirms that P1 (21 units) and P3 (24 units) orders are lost, totaling 45 units that will never arrive. The OR engine is unaware of these losses and overestimates the pipeline by 45 units. To compensate and ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) window, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the 45 lost units as a buffer on top of the forecasted demand. Calculation: Mean of last 4 periods (39, 122, 148, 108, 60 -> avg last 4 = 109.5). Projected demand for (L+1)=3 periods is 109.5 * 3 = 328.5. Adding the 45-unit loss compensation gives 373.5. Sigma is set using recent_N=4 to capture current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high during spring peak (std dev > 40). Pipeline inventory is overstated by 45 units due to confirmed losses in P1 and P3; explicit mu_hat adjustments required until these are offset by new arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The product 'T-shirt in soft jersey' is in its peak spring season. Current on-hand inventory is 141 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 159) is significantly overstated; as documented in Carry-over insights, P1 (21 units) and P3 (24 units) are lost, totaling 45 phantom units. The true pipeline is 159 - 45 = 114 units. Over the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean demand has been ~83 units (122, 148, 108, 60, 74). While demand has softened from the absolute peak of 148, it remains much higher than the initial baseline. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the next (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) considering the phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target coverage for 3 periods at ~83/period is 249 units. Because the backend subtracts the full pipeline (159) from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost 45 units to compensate: (3 * 83) + 45 = 294. I'll set mu_hat to 295. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals show a mix of 1 and 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current seasonal volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'T-shirt in soft jersey', currently in its peak spring/early-summer demand season (late April). Demand has been volatile but high, with a mean of 95.3 units over the last 3 periods and 86.2 units over the last 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 37 units. Total in-transit is 159 units, which includes 9 units from Period 10 and 150 units of phantom pipeline inventory from lost orders in P1 and P3 (45 units). However, accounting for these losses precisely is difficult within the OR backend. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (calculated average is ~1.5). Given Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1), the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (~86 units/period). For L, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period volatility. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the high standard deviation (~31 units) observed during this peak season, ensuring the safety stock is responsive to current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a high-season regime for jersey t-shirts (April/May), with a 5-period mean of ~86 units. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, we are in the peak spring/summer season for T-shirts (early May). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand spiked to 160 in Period 12, following a period of 104; the 5-period mean is approximately 101 units. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. The pipeline shows 260 units in-transit (ordered in Period 10: 9 units and Period 12: 101 units, plus the historical 45 unit discrepancy from Period 1 and 3 losses). However, the in-transit field says 260 units, and history shows only 9 (P10) + 101 (P12) are pending from recent periods, plus the phantom 45 and maybe the Period 4 order of 105 which has not yet surfaced as 'arrived' or 'lost' in the conclude messages. Calculating mu_hat: With L=2 and a current demand regime of ~100/week, a base stock for 3 periods (L+1) should be roughly 300. Since we have 0 on-hand and the 'In-transit' reflects 260 (some of which are likely lost), I will use 'explicit' to ensure the order covers the high demand volatility (sigma ~40). I set mu_hat to 330 (3 * 110) to account for recent high demand and sigma_hat to 70 to provide a higher service level for this low-cost, high-season SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified in early May: Period 12 demand (160) is the highest recorded, pushing the seasonal mean to ~100 units. Pipeline reliability remains degraded by the 45 lost units from P1/P3.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-May (2019/5/13), which is the peak season for T-shirts in soft jersey. Recent demand has been highly volatile, with a record high of 160 in Period 12 followed by 45 in Period 13; however, the lower demand in P13 is likely an underestimate of true demand due to zero on-hand inventory (sold=0). The 5-period mean demand (P9-P13) is approximately 88.6 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 330 units (In-transit), but history indicates 45 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are permanently lost, making the effective pipeline ~285 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods recently. To ensure we capture the remaining spring/summer peak while accounting for pipeline inaccuracy and high volatility, I will use a recent demand window (N=5) and set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to compensate for the 45 lost units that the OR backend still considers part of the pipeline. Since the backend calculates final_order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap), and pipeline is overstated by 45, I will set mu_hat = (1+L) * expected_demand + 45. With L=2 (promised) and mean=90, (3*90)+45 = 315.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Seasonal demand for 'T-shirt in soft jersey' remains in high-regime (May); true demand in Period 13 likely higher than the 45 recorded due to zero stock. Pipeline overestimation of 45 units (from P1/P3 losses) continues to require explicit mu_hat adjustments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in soft jersey', currently in peak spring/summer season (late May). Analysis of the last 7 periods shows a high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 94.4 units (excluding the stockout-limited Period 13). Period 14 (70 units) followed a high Period 12 (160 units), indicating continued volatility. The 'in-transit' figure of 229 includes the 70 units ordered in Period 13 and an implicit 9 units from Period 10, but historical record shows 45 units (from P1 and P3) were lost and never arrived. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (229) from its base stock calculation, and that pipeline is inflated by these 45 lost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure sufficient replenishment. I calculate mu_hat for (L+1)=3 periods based on a seasonal mean of 100 units/period (300 total) plus a 45-unit buffer to compensate for the phantom pipeline. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the standard promised time, as recent arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Seasonal demand mean for Jersey T-shirt stabilized at ~100 units/period during May. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 45 lost units from P1/P3, necessitating an offset in mu_hat until inventory levels recalibrate.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. The product 'T-shirt in soft jersey' is in high-season demand (late spring/early summer), which typically sees sustained demand. We are currently out of stock (on-hand 0). Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been volatile but significant: 104, 160, 45*, 70, 72. Note that P12-P15 demand was partially suppressed by stockouts. The actual mean demand in this High Season regime is approximately 100 units/period. The pipeline inventory (314) includes 45 units from P1 and P3 which are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 314 - 45 = 269. To ensure the backend places orders that cover (L+1) periods of demand while accounting for the phantom pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * 100 = 300 (assuming L=2). Since final order = base_stock - (pipeline - lost units), I need to adjust mu_hat to offset the 45 lost units. Adjusted mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Lost Units) = 345 units. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods recently.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 17 (June 3), managing a jersey T-shirt SKU during its peak summer season. Demand remains high but volatile, with recent demand pulses reaching 120-160 units. I am estimating the current seasonal mean (L+1 period demand) at approximately 300 units (100 units/period for L=2). Pipeline inventory (345 units) is significantly inflated by 45 lost units (orders from P1 and P3), making the effective pipeline ~300. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to offset the loss (effective_mu = base_mu + lost_units). This ensures the base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in orders that maintain a service level consistent with our $1:$1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting roughly the median of expected demand).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 17, the seasonal demand for Jersey T-shirts remains established in the high regime (range 70-160) throughout June. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) continues to be overstated by 45 units due to confirmed losses from Periods 1 and 3.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' (Jersey T-shirt) is in the middle of its high-demand spring/summer season (June). Recent demand has fluctuated but remains robust, with a 5-period average (P13-P17) of approximately 81.2 units, though P13 and P16 saw lost sales due to zero stock. The pipeline (In-transit: 229) is currently inflated by 45 units from lost orders in P1 and P3, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is 184 units. Current on-hand is 17. The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since profit and holding costs are both $1.00, the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the backend aims for base_stock = mu_hat. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) while correcting for the 45-unit pipeline overstatement, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculated mu_hat = (Expected mean demand * 3 periods) + pipeline correction = (85 * 3) + 45 = 300. This forces the system to recognize the need for more stock despite the phantom units in transit. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period variance, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the current seasonal regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (2019/6/17), the SKU 'T-shirt in soft jersey' remains in its high seasonal demand regime, with demand in Period 18 at 62 units. The 5-period mean demand (ignoring stockouts in P16) is approx 80 units. Lead times have consistently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. The critical issue remains the systemic overestimation of 'In-transit' inventory by 45 units originating from lost shipments in Periods 1 and 3. As the OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', an 'In-transit' value of 283 units (which includes those 45 non-existent units) will lead to significant under-ordering and stockouts. To remedy this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean of 95 (to account for spring/summer peak) over (L+1)=3 periods, which is 285. I then add the 45 units to 'phantom' this inventory through the base stock calculation, effectively neutralizing the 45-unit error in the pipeline. sigma_hat is set to a higher value (explicit 60) to provide a safety buffer against the high demand volatility and stockout frequency observed in recent periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), 'T-shirt in soft jersey' remains in a high-demand seasonal regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) has averaged 89.4 units, despite stockouts in P16, P18, and P19 suggesting the true latent demand is likely closer to 100-110 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 276) is still overstated by 45 units due to confirmed losses from Period 1 (21 units) and Period 3 (24 units). To compensate for this 45-unit phantom inventory in the OR backend's capped policy [base_stock - pipeline_inventory], I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Anticipated mean demand per period is ~105. For a lead time (L) of 2, (1+L) * 105 = 315. I add the 45 lost units to this total to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, resulting in mu_hat = 360. Lead time remains fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods, so 'calculate' is used to capture the average behavior.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. The product is a 'T-shirt in soft jersey', which is currently in its peak summer season. Historical demand in the previous 5 periods has averaged ~83 units (62, 94, 100, plus earlier high periods), though Period 20 demand was 100 before stock out. The lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. A critical factor remains the pipeline inventory: 'In-transit' shows 360 units, but this includes 45 units confirmed lost from Periods 1 and 3 (21+24). This overstatement means the OR engine thinks there are 45 more units arriving than actually exist. To compensate for this and prevent under-ordering during the summer peak, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) as 3 periods * 90 units/period = 270. To offset the 45 units that will never arrive but are still 'in-transit', I set mu_hat to 315 (270 + 45). I set sigma_hat to 70 to account for high seasonal volatility (std dev of ~40 for single period * sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand for jersey t-shirts sustained: 5-period mean ~85-90 units. Pipeline overestimation of 45 units from early losses (P1/P3) persists and requires mu_hat inflation.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08, occurring during the peak summer demand for 'T-shirt in soft jersey'. Recent demand remains strong (Period 21 demand spiked to 211, though prior mean was ~100). The current in-transit inventory is 360 units, which includes 45 units confirmed lost from Periods 1 and 3 (21 and 24 units respectively). Consequently, the actual pipeline is 315 units. This 45-unit overestimation by the OR backend's inventory tracking must be compensated for by inflating mu_hat. Given the recent demand surge to 211 and a high-season mean around 100, I will set mu_hat using an explicit value. Assuming L=2, the backend uses (L+1)=3 periods for base stock calculation. Target mu_hat = (Expected Demand * 3) + Loss Offset. Expected demand for July is ~110. Thus, (110 * 3) + 45 = 375. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value (100) to account for the massive variance seen in the last period (211) versus previous weeks (~100). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Summer demand peak intensified (Period 21 demand 211); 5-period mean is rising toward 110 units. Pipeline overestimation of 45 units from early losses (P1/P3) remains a critical factor for base stock calculations.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (2019/07/15), we are in the peak summer season for the 'T-shirt in soft jersey'. Demand has been very high: Period 21 saw 211 units, and Period 22 saw 146 units. The 5-period moving average has risen significantly to approximately 110 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 291 units in-transit. However, the pipeline inventory is chronically overstated by 45 units due to confirmed losses from Periods 1 and 3 (21 and 24 units, respectively). To compensate for this 45-unit 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. My target base stock for a (L+1) horizon with L=2 and mean demand of 110 is 330 units. To offset the 45 missing units in the OR backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat. Instead of the 'true' expected demand over 3 periods (330), I am setting mu_hat to 375 (330 + 45). This ensures the ordering logic considers the actual available pipeline effectively.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed summer demand peak (July); 5-period mean ~110 units. Pipeline overestimation of 45 units (P1/P3 losses) remains a persistent error factor requiring mu_hat inflation of +45 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'T-shirt in soft jersey' is in its peak summer season (July). Recent demand has been very high, with a spike to 211 in Period 21 and a 4-period average of ~140 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline (In-transit: 360) is fundamentally inaccurate. Specifically, 45 units from Period 1 and 3 are confirmed lost, and the Period 13 order of 70 units (ordered 2019/5/6) is now 11 periods overdue and almost certainly lost. This brings total phantom inventory to 115 units (45 + 70). To compensate for the 'In-transit' figure being inflated by 115 units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted mean demand (\u03bc) over L+1 periods (where L=2) is approximately 140 * 3 = 420 units. Adding the 115-unit pipeline correction to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the actual physical requirement results in an explicit mu_hat of 535. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility of the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory reliability has further degraded: Period 13 order (70 units) is now 11 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing total phantom inventory in the In-transit count to 115 units (P1, P3, P13). Summer peak demand continues to be significantly higher than spring baseline, averaging ~140 units per period in July.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '717490003' (Jersey T-shirt) is currently in its peak summer season (late July). Demand has been consistently high, recently averaging ~110-140 units, with a significant spike of 211 in Period 21. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an In-transit pipeline of 535 units. However, based on historical evidence, 115 of these units are confirmed lost (P1: 21, P3: 24, P13: 70), meaning the 'phantom' pipeline inventory is approximately 21.5% of the total recorded in-transit. To force the OR backend to place an order that compensates for these lost units while accounting for the high seasonal mean, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=2, (3 * 130) + 115 = 505. Setting mu_hat to 500 and sigma_hat to 100 ensures a high enough base stock to trigger an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count. Lead time remains fluctuating between 1 and 2, so 'calculate' is used to capture this average behavior.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 25, total phantom (lost) pipeline inventory is confirmed at 115 units (P1, P3, P13). Summer peak demand for Jersey T-shirts (July) is significantly higher than earlier regimes, showing a mean demand shift to ~130 units/period over the last 5 relevant periods (excluding zero-sales/stockout periods).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26. As of the end of Period 25, the T-shirt SKU (717490003) is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline (In-transit: 535) is significantly inflated by 115 units of confirmed lost inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 13 (21+24+70 = 115). Adjusting the effective In-transit to 420 units (535 - 115). Demand for 'Jersey Basic T-shirts' is in the summer peak (August); excluding stockout periods where demand was not satisfied, the mean demand over the recent regime (P21-P25) is approximately 130 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3) despite the phantom pipeline inventory, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 505. This is calculated as: ((130 mean demand * 3 periods) + 115 phantom inventory offset). This forces the base stock calculation to account for the lost units that will never arrive, protecting availability during this high-demand summer period.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed peak summer demand regime (July/August) mean is ~130 units. Total phantom pipeline inventory (losses from P1, P3, P13) remains at 115 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation until inventory levels normalize.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 27 (mid-August), concluding the peak summer season for Jersey T-shirts. Historical data shows that demand remains in a high-regime (mean ~130 units/period) during July and August, although individual period results vary based on stock availability. Pipeline reliability is severely compromised: total 'phantom' inventory is confirmed at 115 units (P1: 21, P3: 24, P13: 70), which will never arrive but still counts against the base stock in the OR engine. To compensate, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to ensure the engine places orders despite this inflated In-transit count. Using a 3-period lead time (L+1=4) and a base mean demand estimate of 120 units, the baseline mu_hat would be 480. Adding the 115 units of lost inventory as a buffer brings the explicit mu_hat to 595. This setting aims to maintain stock levels through the end of the high season.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent phantom pipeline inventory of 115 units (P1, P3, P13) requires sustained mu_hat inflation of approximately +115 units to prevent the system from under-ordering during the remaining peak season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (late August), we are approaching the end of the peak summer season for jersey t-shirts. Demand has softened recently (59 in P27, down from July peaks), but remains relevant. The primary operational challenge is a massive overestimation of pipeline inventory due to cumulative lost orders: P1 (21 units), P3 (24 units), and P13 (70 units), totaling 115 phantom units in the 'In-transit' count. To compensate for the 115 units the OR backend thinks we have (but don't), I am inflating mu_hat. I estimate the base weekly demand at ~85 units (5-period mean). With a lead time of 2, the expected base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~255 units). By seting mu_hat to 370 (approx. 3 * 85 + 115), I force the system to reconcile the missing 115 units and place an order to cover current on-hand shortages (0 units). Lead time is set to calculate to reflect the mix of 1-3 period arrivals seen in history.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the Jersey T-shirt enters the tail end of its summer peak. Demand remains significant (Period 28 demand: 90) but is expected to gradually cool down as autumn approaches. A critical issue remains: 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total confirmed lost units are 115 (P1: 21, P3: 24, P13: 70). The current 'In-transit' figure of 593 is overstated by these 115 units. To compensate and ensure the backend OR logic orders enough to cover the (L+1) demand window, I must inflate mu_hat. The current demand regime mean (excluding stockouts) is approximately 100 units/period. To offset the 115 phantom units over the 3-period lead-time cycle (L=2, thus 1+L=3), I will set mu_hat explicitly. Calculation: (Target Demand Mean 100 * (1+L)) + Total Phantom Inventory 115 = 415. Setting sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility observed in August (approx 40-50 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand regime transition from peak summer to late-summer/early-autumn; mean demand stabilizing around 90-100 units. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 115 units (P1, P3, P13), requiring mu_hat inflation of +115 until these orders are purged or stock levels equilibrate.

Recent non-zero demand samples (Periods 28-29: 90, 118) suggest a mean demand around 100 units. However, the system faces a critical pipeline inventory accuracy issue: active losses from Period 1 (21 units), Period 3 (24 units), Period 13 (70 units), and now likely Period 24 (175 units, now 6 periods overdue) total 290 units of 'phantom' inventory in the In-transit count (593). To compensate for this 290-unit overestimation by the OR backend (which would otherwise stop ordering), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for a 2-period lead time (L=2, coverage=3 periods) at a mean of 100 units/period plus the 290-unit pipeline deficit: (3 * 100) + 290 = 590. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=5 to capture current volatility while avoiding the extreme summer spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Phantom pipeline inventory is now estimated at 290 units (P1, P3, P13 confirmed; P24 order of 175 units is 6 periods overdue and likely lost). Demand regime is stabilizing at ~100 units/period for late summer.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the demand for Jersey T-shirts is transitioning from the summer peak to a late-summer/early-autumn regime, with demand stabilizing around 90-110 units. The critical issue remains the significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' quantity (451 units) from the calculated base stock. However, 290 units of that pipeline are definitively lost (P1, P3, P13, and P24). Specifically, P24 (175 units) ordered on July 22 is now 7 periods overdue and clearly lost. Since 451 (Total In-transit) - 290 (Lost) = 161 (Real In-transit), the system is overestimating available supply by 290 units. To compensate, I set mu_hat to 'explicit' using the forecast demand (100) multiplied by (1+L) = 300, and then adding the 290 lost units to ensure the OR engine places a meaningful order. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility (N=5) to maintain a buffer during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 290 units (P1, P3, P13, and P24) as P24 (175 units) is now 7 periods overdue. Demand regime is in late-summer transition with a mean of ~100 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (September 16, 2019), the demand for the Jersey T-shirt is transitioning out of the summer peak into a lower autumn regime. Recent demand samples (51, 28) show a clear cooling trend compared to the summer average of ~100-130. I will prioritize the last 5 demand periods to capture this downward shift. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' count of 499 is highly unreliable. Based on historical data, 290 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P1, P3, P13, and P24). The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. To prevent the system from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 290 units. Calculation: Targeted base stock for the current regime (~55 units/period over 1+2 periods = 165) + 290 lost units = 455. Setting mu_hat to 455 (explicit) ensures the backend accounts for the lost shipments while maintaining a safety buffer for the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand regime shift confirmed from late-summer peak to autumn; 5-period mean (excluding stockouts) has dropped to ~55-60 units. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 290 units (P1, P3, P13, P24), requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'T-shirt in soft jersey' has transitioned from the high summer peak to a lower autumn regime. The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 32 units, down significantly from the summer average of 100+. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this downward shift. Lead times continue to be volatile (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), so I will use calculate to average historical observations. Regarding the pipeline inventory: the In-transit count of 451 units is heavily inflated by lost orders. Confirmed losses include P1 (21), P3 (24), P13 (70), and now P24 (175, ordered 9 periods ago with no arrival), totaling 290 phantom units. To compensate for these 290 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for the 3-period window (L=2, plus current period) based on the new mean of 32 units: (1+2)*32 = 96 units. To this, I add the 290 phantom units to ensure the OR engine's formula (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful net requirement. Target explicit mu_hat = 96 + 290 = 386.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed autumn demand regime shift: mean demand has stabilized at ~32 units over the last 3 periods. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 290 units (P1, P3, P13, P24).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 34 (late September) has shifted from the summer peak (~130 units) to a stable autumn level (~32-40 units). Recent demand samples (P31-P33: 28, 37, 51) support this decline. The current on-hand inventory is 23 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 451 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P1 (21), P3 (24), P13 (70), and P24 (175), totaling 290 'phantom' units. Subtracting these from the 451 total leaves a corrected pipeline of 161 units (likely the P27 order of 142 and P31 order of 48, though logic suggests some arrivals have already occurred). Given the lower autumn demand, the system is currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current regime and use explicit mu_hat inflation (+290 units) to correctly offset the phantom pipeline inventory and prevent the OR backend from erroneously suppressing orders due to the high In-transit count.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), the 'T-shirt in soft jersey' is in its autumn demand regime, where demand has significantly declined and stabilized compared to the summer peak. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P31-P34) is approximately 38.5 units. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the In-transit pipeline. Historically, orders from P1 (21), P3 (24), P13 (70), and P24 (175) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 290 units of phantom inventory. The current In-transit is 451 units. Subtracting the 290 phantom units leaves a real pipeline of 161 units (mostly from P35). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 290 phantom units as available stock and thus under-ordering, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic from previous periods, I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Total_Phantom_Inventory. With L=2 and Mean=38.5, base mu_hat is 115.5. Adding 290 units results in an explicit mu_hat of ~405. Setting mu_hat to 400 and sigma_hat to 15 (reflecting lower autumn volatility) to ensure the system maintains a base stock that accounts for real demand while offsetting the data corruption in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed autumn demand regime (late Sep/Early Oct) mean is stabilized at ~38 units. Phantom pipeline inventory remains critical at 290 units (P1, P3, P13, P24), requiring a +290 mu_hat offset in the base stock calculation to ensure availability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'T-shirt in soft jersey' has transitioned from its summer peak (~130 units) to a stable autumn regime. Demand over the last five periods (excluding stockouts or adjusting for them) has averaged approximately 36 units (Periods 31-35: 28, 37, 51, 38, 26). However, the in-transit inventory of 451 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' or lost orders. Based on the history, orders from P1 (21), P3 (24), P13 (70), and P24 (175) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 290 phantom units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom stock and deciding not to order, I must increase the mu_hat parameter to offset this loss. The base demand expectation for (1+L) periods (L=2) is ~108 units (36 * 3). Adding the 290 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 398. This ensures the backend maintains enough stock for the current demand regime despite the pipeline errors. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead time variance (1-3 periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 (Oct 21), demand is in a lower autumn regime, with the last 5 periods showing demands of 51, 28, 37, 51, 38, 26, 18. The mean demand for this autumn phase is approximately 35 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'in-transit' count of 451 units, which is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P1 (21), P3 (24), P13 (70), and P24 (175). These total 290 units of phantom inventory. Additionally, the orders placed in Periods 19 (47 units), 20 (84 units), and 21 (0 units - irrelevant) are extremely overdue (16+ periods), adding another 131 units (47+84) to the list of likely lost shipments. Total phantom inventory is now estimated at 421 units (290 + 131). With actual on-hand at 0 and in-transit at 451, effectively only 30 units (from recent orders or errors) might actually arrive. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 451 units and stopping all ordering while the shelf is empty, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 550, which covers the cycle and lead time (1+2=3 periods) of true demand (~105 units) plus the 421 units of lost pipeline inventory. This 'inflates' the base stock requirement to offset the phantom stock in the backend calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 421 units. Added P19 (47 units) and P20 (84 units) to the lost/missing list as they are >15 periods overdue. Autumn demand mean stabilized at ~35 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'T-shirt in soft jersey' is in its autumn low-regime, with recent demand samples of 37, 51, 38, 26, 18, and 24 (average ~32 units). However, the system's stock levels are severely compromised by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that are in-transit but confirmed lost. As of Period 37, the total lost inventory is 421 units (P1, P3, P13, P24, P19, P20). Our total In-transit is 550, meaning only 129 units (including the P37 order of 99) are likely real. With 0 on-hand and only 129 actual units coming, we must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset the 421 phantom units currently visible to the OR backend. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to (1+L)*32 + 421, which equals ~517 units. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the true required inventory while neutralizing the impact of the lost shipments in the pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total phantom pipeline inventory refined to 421 units (P1: 21, P3: 24, P13: 70, P24: 175, P19: 47, P20: 84). Autumn demand mean is stable at ~32 units/period. Sustained mu_hat inflation of approximately +420 units is required until these lost orders are manually purged or stock recalibrates.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'T-shirt in soft jersey' has transitioned into an autumn/winter low regime. Recent demand samples from Period 31 to 38 are: 28, 37, 51, 38, 26, 18, 24, 17. The mean of these 8 values is approximately 30 units/period. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 451) is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost orders. Following the cumulative audit in Period 38, the total phantom inventory is 421 units (P1, P3, P13, P24, P19, P20). Subtracting this phantom amount from the visible In-transit (451 - 421) leaves a true pipeline of 30 units. Combined with On-hand (82), the effective inventory is 112 units. To prevent the OR backend's automated logic from seeing 451 'In-transit' units and stopping all ordering, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the current seasonal mean (30) multiplied by (1+L) plus the phantom offset (421). With L=2, mu_hat = (30 * 3) + 421 \u2248 511. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high volume of lost units that will never arrive. sigma_hat is set based on recent autumn volatility (std dev ~11).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'T-shirt in soft jersey' has settled into a low-season autumn/winter regime. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 20 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 67 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3 periods of the current demand level. A significant operational challenge persists regarding 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P13, P24, P19, and P20 (totaling 421 units) are long-overdue and confirmed as lost. These units remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (451 total in-transit - 30 units likely from recent activity), which would normally prevent the OR backend from placing new orders. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation for base stock is (1+L)*demand + z*sigma. With L=2 and demand=20, the target inventory should be around 75-80 units. However, because the OR backend subtracts the phantom 421 units from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by approximately the amount of the lost inventory (+421) plus the projected demand for the review period to trigger any necessary replenishment. Since current on-hand (67) is close to the seasonal requirement, I will set mu_hat to balance the phantom inventory and maintain current levels without over-ordering as we move deeper into the low season.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime for autumn/winter confirmed at ~20 units/period (based on P35-P39). Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at 421 units, requiring an offset in mu_hat until the backend inventory count is corrected.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'T-shirt in soft jersey' has shifted into a low-volume autumn/winter regime. The mean demand over the last five periods (P36-P40) is approximately 17 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' count of 451 units, which consists almost entirely of lost or significantly overdue shipments (P1, P3, P13, P19, P20, P24 total 421 units). Without adjusting mu_hat, the backend OR logic will see 451 units in the pipeline and refuse to place any new orders, despite these units never arriving. I will continue to apply a mu_hat inflation of +421 units to neutralize this phantom inventory. For the demand forecast, I am using the mean of the recent stable regime (approx 17) multiplied by (1+L). With L=2, base mu_hat is 51. Adding the 421 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 472. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent low volatility in this regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), the demand for this jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a low-volume late-autumn/winter regime. Recent demand (P38-P41) has been 17, 15, 11, and 12, respectively, establishing a clear mean of approximately 14 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' accounting. The current In-transit balance is 451 units. According to historical tracking, the following orders are confirmed lost or extremely overdue (>15 periods): P1 (21), P3 (24), P13 (70), P19 (47), P20 (84), and P24 (175). These total 421 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock to determine the order quantity, an In-transit value inflated by 421 'phantom' units will result in an order of 0 indefinitely, even if on-hand inventory drops to zero. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that equals the (Review+Lead time) demand plus the phantom inventory offset. With L=2 (promised), Review+Lead = 3 periods. Expected demand = 3 * 14 = 42. Phantom offset = 421. Targeted mu_hat = 463. This 'tricks' the backend into perceiving a higher requirement, which, when the 451 in-transit units are subtracted, aligns with the actual need to maintain a modest safety stock for the low-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed total phantom pipeline inventory is 421 units (P1, P3, P13, P19, P20, P24). Winter demand regime is stable at ~14 units/period. Continuous mu_hat inflation of ~420 units is required to neutralize the effect of lost orders in the pipeline count.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2, 2019. This SKU (Jersey T-shirt) is in a low-demand winter regime with recent demand samples of 11, 12, and 22 units. The 5-period average demand (P38-P42) is approximately 15.4 units. A significant operational issue remains: total phantom pipeline inventory is 421 units (P1, P3, P13, P19, P20, and P24) which the backend OR engine believes are in-transit but are actually lost. This 'phantom stock' prevents the system from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline exceeds the required base stock. To compensate, I set mu_hat to approximately the phantom total plus 3 periods of expected demand (421 + 45 = 466) using the 'explicit' method. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to overcome the pipeline overestimation while on-hand inventory is still present (22 units). I maintain lead time 'L' as 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variance and sigma_hat as 'recent_N' to capture recent low-regime volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the winter demand regime for SKU 717490003 (T-shirt in soft jersey). Recent demand (Periods 40-43) has stabilized at a low mean of approximately 13 units per period (11, 12, 22, 7). On-hand inventory is 15 units. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The current In-transit count is 451 units, but based on the carry-over insights and historical evidence, at least 421 of these units are lost (P1, P3, P13, P19, P20, P24). Specifically, Period 42 conclude shows an In-transit balance of 451, which consists of the 421 lost units plus a more recent order that hasn't arrived. Since the backend OR logic subtracts the entire pipeline (451) from the base stock calculation, and our expected base stock for a lead time of 2 is only around (1+2)*13 = 39 units, the system will not place any new orders despite most of that pipeline being non-existent. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 460 units. This value is calculated to offset the 421 lost units and provide a small buffer for the current demand regime (Target Base Stock \u2248 421 + 39). This forces the backend to recognize that additional physical stock is needed. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time of approx 1.7 periods, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current low volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing a low-demand winter regime for 'T-shirt in soft jersey'. Recent demand for the last five periods (P40-P44) has been 11, 12, 22, 7, 8, yielding a mean of 12.0 units per period. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 451 units, but our 'Carry-over Insights' track 421 units as 'phantom' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P13, P19, P20, and P24). Subtracting phantom stock from the pipeline (451 - 421 = 30) reveals only 30 units are actually expected to arrive. With current On-hand at 7, the OR backend sees 458 available units (On-hand + In-transit), leading it to order zero. To force the backend to place an order that covers our actual need (approx. 40 units for L+1), we must offset the 421 lost units by inflating mu_hat. Setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 457 (approx. 420 phantom + 3*12 projected demand) allows the OR logic to recognize the real stock deficit. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (approx. 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains 421 units (P1, P3, P13, P19, P20, P24). Current demand regime (winter) is stable at ~12 units/period. mu_hat requires a ~420 unit inflation to compensate for overstated pipeline stock until the system purged these entries.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. We are in a stable winter demand regime for 'T-shirt in soft jersey'. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 13 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is reported as 451 units, but based on extensive historical tracking, 421 of those units are confirmed lost/phantom shipments from Periods 1, 3, 13, 19, 20, and 24. These orders are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and have not concluded. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this 'phantom stock' and refusing to order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 421 units. The target inventory level (base stock) needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1 review period) plus the 421 units required to neutralize the pipeline error. With a mean demand of 13, the base stock should be (3 * 13) + 421 = 460. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to 460. Sigma_hat is set to 5 to reflect low winter volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (Dec 30) indicates we are in the middle of a low-demand winter regime for the 'Jersey T-shirt'. Demand over the last five periods (P42-P46) has been consistently low: 22, 7, 8, 16, 16, yielding a mean of 13.8 units. The primary operational challenge remains the high 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The current In-transit count is 460 units. Based on historical tracking (P1, P3, P13, P19, P20, P24), 421 of these units are confirmed lost/missing (orders >15 periods old). Additionally, the order from P46 (9 units) is in-transit, leaving 30 units (from P37) that arrived in P38 but might still be affecting the delta if the backend doesn't purge correctly. More importantly, the system sees 460 units in transit against a required base stock for a 14-unit demand regime, which would result in zero ordering. To force an order and maintain stock, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to 461 (the 421 lost units + 40 units to cover ~3 periods of demand), essentially neutralizing the phantom inventory and ensuring the base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value reflecting the reduced winter volatility.
