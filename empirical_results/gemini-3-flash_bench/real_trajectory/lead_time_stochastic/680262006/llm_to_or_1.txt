Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 680262006 (Sports tights). Historical demand shows a significant upward trend over the last 5 weeks, starting at 52 units/week and reaching 125 units/week. This suggests Jan/Feb fitness seasonality ('New Year, New Me' resolutions). As on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero, we must place an order immediately. The promised lead time is 2, so the OR backend will calculate targets for L+1 = 3 periods of demand. Given the clear growth trend, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~130) rather than the lower Jan start, ensuring the OR backend's base stock is high enough to meet this seasonal momentum. I'll stick to the default lead time (2) as we have no data yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'SUPREME tights', a sportswear item. Looking at the historical demand provided (Jan 7 to Feb 4: 52, 69, 123, 141, 125) and Period 1 demand (127), we see a clear demand shift that occurred around late January. The average demand over the last 4 weeks (Jan 21 - Feb 11) is approx 129 units. There is zero on-hand inventory because the first order of 146 units placed in Period 1 hasn't arrived yet (promised lead time is 2, so arrival is expected in Period 3). To avoid stockouts while managing the high demand regime discovered in the last 4 weeks, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to capture the higher mean (~129/week) rather than the lower full-history average. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to reflect recent volatility. Lead time is kept at default as we have no evidence yet to suggest it differs from the promised 2 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is 'SUPREME tights', a sports item. Historically, demand was rising in January/February (52, 69, 123, 141, 125). In Periods 1 and 2, observed demand was 127 and 165, confirming a sustained higher demand regime compared to the early January baseline. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 289 in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2, meaning the P1 order (146 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message. Therefore, there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or lost shipments. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=4 (covering P2, P1, and the last two historical samples) to capture the upward trend in demand more effectively than the long-term average. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. L remains default.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is H&M Sport Supreme Tights, which has a clear upward demand trend (from ~52-141 in January to 127-168 in February). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) is expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3 conclude. This suggests the lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Since we cannot confirm the arrival of the P1 order yet, I will use 'explicit' for L to assume a lead time of 3 to be safe, as we have 3 periods of demand (P1, P2, P3) with 0 arrivals. Demand is trending up, so I will use the last 4 samples (including the 3 game history samples and the last pre-game sample) for mu_hat via recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher February demand levels (~150/week).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is 'SUPREME tights', a sporty functional item. Historically, demand has been steadily increasing: Jan averages around 101, Feb increases toward 150+, and recent weeks (P2-P4) show high demand (165, 168, 146). The lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). Although P1's order of 146 units hasn't 'concluded', the arrival of the P2 order suggests it might have been lost or significantly delayed; however, we cannot confirm a permanent change to lead time yet. With 0 on-hand inventory and high demand, we are currently stocking out. I will use the last 4 samples (P1-P4: 127, 165, 168, 146) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the current 'active' season better than January data. This balances the recent slight dip in P4 with the high demand of P2 and P3.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'SUPREME tights', a sport apparel item. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is 0. An order of 143 units placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (Lead Time = 2). However, the order from Period 1 (146 units) has never arrived. Usually, with a promised lead time of 2, it should have arrived in Period 3's conclude message. Its absence suggests the shipment is likely lost. Demand has shown an upward trend from the initial samples (avg ~102) to the game periods (127, 165, 168, 146, 127). The average demand over the last 5 game periods is approximately 146.6. Since we have 0 on-hand and 483 in-transit (orders from P1, P3, P4, P5), but P1 is likely lost, the effective pipeline inventory is likely lower. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand at this higher level, and use the default lead time calculation as the one confirmed arrival matched the promise.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 shipment (146 units) likely lost - failed to arrive by Period 5 (Promised LT=2). Demand regime shift detected: game period demand (avg ~147) is significantly higher than pre-game samples (avg ~102).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Demand for 'SUPREME tights' has stabilized at a higher regime than pre-game samples, averaging approximately 144 units per period across the last 6 periods (127, 165, 168, 146, 127, 131). The Period 1 order (146 units) is officially considered lost as it hasn't arrived by Period 6 (LT=2). However, we see high variability in actual lead times: P2 arrived in 2 periods (P4), while P5 arrived in 1 period (P6). The in-transit pipeline of 482 units includes orders from P3 (157 units) and P4 (179 units), both of which are now overdue or at the limit of their promised lead time. Since on-hand is 0 and we've suffered significant stockouts, I will use a 'recent_N' approach (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 'game-time' demand regime, and set L to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals don't yet confirm a permanent shift in lead time despite the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Avg ~144 units/period since P1. Period 1 shipment (146 units) confirmed lost. Lead time variability noted: P2 (LT=2), P5 (LT=1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product is 'SUPREME tights', a spring/summer sports garment. Historical demand since the start of the game (Period 1-7) has been stable with a mean of 144 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-game samples (avg ~102). We have a critical stockout situation: on-hand inventory is 0. Period 1 shipment (146 units) is long overdue and confirmed lost. Period 3 shipment (157 units) is now overdue (it's Been 5 periods since ordering, promised lead time is 2), which strongly suggests it is also lost. Period 4 shipment (179 units) is also past its promised arrival date. Total in-transit is 482 (from P3, P4, P5, P6, P7), but much of this is likely lost. Demand is consistent at ~144. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*144 and sigma_hat based on recent variability to trigger an aggressive order to recover from the lost pipeline. I use recent_N=7 for demand as it captures the current sustained regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 shipment (157 units) likely lost - failed to arrive by Period 7 (3 periods past promised LT). In-transit reliability is currently low.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'SUPREME tights', which shows a higher demand regime (avg ~147) compared to pre-game data (~102). Since the game started (P1-P8), we have faced significant supply issues: Period 1 shipment (146 units) is lost, and Period 3 shipment (157 units) is now 6 periods late (promised LT=2), confirming it is also lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P4 (179 units - now 2 periods late) and potentially P5/P6/P7 (though P5 arrived in P6, and P7/P8 had 0 orders). We must reconcile the pipeline: P1 is lost, P3 is lost. The 482 units in-transit likely include P4 (179 units) and other subsequent attempts, but arrivals are unreliable. Based on the 8 game periods, the average demand is 148.25. Given the high stockout risk and unreliable transit, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher game-period mean (~148) and volatility. Lead time 'calculate' will use historical arrivals (LT=2, LT=1) to estimate the mean, but we remain cautious given the known losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 8 shipment reconciliation: Period 3 shipment (157 units) is confirmed lost (exceeded promised LT by 6 periods). Total pipeline integrity is low with P1 and P3 lost. Seasonal demand for sports tights remains stable at the elevated game-period average (~148).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The demand for SUPREME tights has stabilized at a higher level than the pre-game samples, averaging approximately 147 units per period since the start of the game (ranging from 127 to 178). Unfortunately, our supply chain has been unreliable: shipments from Period 1 (146 units) and Period 3 (157 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are now 7-9 periods past their order date (promised LT=2). Our current on-hand inventory is 0, and our reported 'In-transit' of 482 units includes these lost shipments. Adjusting for losses, the 'true' pipeline consists of orders from Period 4 (179 units) onward. Because the backend OR engine relies on the reported 'In-transit' (482 units), it significantly overestimates current protection. To force the OR engine to place a corrective order and cover the (L+1) period demand (approx 441 units), I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets the phantom inventory. I am targeting a base stock that accounts for 'real' demand while acknowledging that the backend sees 482 units in transit. Given the high stockout risk and lost shipments, I will use L=default (2), and set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the system realizes it is under-stocked relative to recent demand trends (~147/period).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Alert: Period 1 (146) and Period 3 (157) shipments are confirmed lost. Backend 'In-transit' tally (482) is inflated by 303 phantom units, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to trigger replenishment.

LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 (2019/4/22). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. The demand since Period 1 has averaged ~140 units, despite a recent dip in Period 10 (81 units). The pipeline \u2018In-transit\u2019 total of 764 units is highly unreliable. As noted in carry-over insights, the shipments from Period 1 (146 units) and Period 3 (157 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 303 'phantom' units that the OR backend still counts as pipeline inventory. Additionally, the order from Period 4 (179 units) is now 5 periods past its promised lead time of 2, making it highly probable that it is also lost. If we assume P1, P3, and P4 are lost, 482 units (146+157+179) of the 764 are non-existent. The remaining 'true' in-transit is likely only the Period 10 order of 282 units. To force the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) to place an order that compensates for these 482 lost units while targeting a 3-period demand horizon (L+1=3) at ~140 units/period (420 units), I must set mu_hat explicitly. I will set mu_hat to 902 (calculated as the desired base stock of ~420 plus the 482 phantom units). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Shipment from Period 4 (179 units) is now classified as lost (7 periods since order, 5 past promised LT). Total phantom units in pipeline: 482 (P1=146, P3=157, P4=179). Demand remains in the ~140 range despite P10 dip.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we face a critical inventory shortage. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has cooled slightly in the last two periods (81, 83) compared to the game-period average of ~145, likely due to stockout-driven demand signal degradation or a late-April seasonal dip. Pipeline integrity is severely compromised: shipments from P1 (146), P3 (157), and now P4 (179) are confirmed lost. Total phantom units in the backend 'In-transit' tally are 482 units (146+157+179). These units will never arrive but prevent the OR backend from ordering. To force replenishment, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate forward demand at ~130 units/period. Target 'base_stock' must cover 3 periods (L+1). Calculation: (130 * 3) + 482 (phantom compensation) = 872. By setting mu_hat = 872, the OR engine (calculating base_stock \u2248 mu_hat) will see an 'inventory position' of 0 + 943 (total in-transit) and place a corrective order if the safety stock/cap logic permits, bypasssing the phantom stagnation.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Update: Total phantom units in 'In-transit' increased to 482 (P1=146, P3=157, P4=179). Order from P6 (lead time 1) confirms that while some shipments arrive fast, the overall supply chain is unreliable.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and the pipeline inventory is heavily compromised by lost shipments. Analysis of the 'In-transit' figure (943) compared to historical conclude messages confirms that orders from Period 1 (146), Period 3 (157), and Period 4 (179) are lost, totaling 482 phantom units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), meaning these 482 units are preventing necessary replenishment. Current demand has dropped from the earlier game-period average of ~145 to a more recent average of ~87 over the last 3 periods (P10-P12). To force the backend to place an order despite the 482 phantom units, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) at the recent mean of ~87, plus an offset to neutralize the phantom inventory of 482. Target Base Stock = (3 * 87) + 482 = 261 + 482 = 743. By setting mu_hat to 743, the backend will calculate a base_stock around 800-900 (depending on sigma), which minus the 943 in-transit will likely result in a small or zero order this turn, but sets the floor to resume ordering as soon as real shipments arrive or demand spikes. Given the stockout, the immediate goal is to correct the inventory logic distorted by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Crisis: 482 units are confirmed lost (P1=146, P3=157, P4=179) but remain in the backend 'In-transit' count. Demand regime shift: recent average has decreased to ~87 units/period (P10-P12) from the previous ~145.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are facing a significant supply chain integrity issue. The 'In-transit' count of 764 units includes 482 units from lost shipments (Period 1: 146, Period 3: 157, Period 4: 179) which the OR backend still considers part of the pipeline. Since the backend calculates orders as BaseStock - Pipeline, these phantom units prevent replenishment. To force the system to order, I must calculate an 'explicit' mu_hat that represents the expected demand over (L+1) periods PLUS the 482 lost units. Demand has shifted from ~145 units/period to approximately 84 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P10-P13). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the replenishment cycle is 3 periods. Expected 3-period demand is roughly 252 units (84 * 3). Adding the 482 phantom units to this target results in a mu_hat of 734. This adjustment ensures the OR logic sees the 'On-hand + Pipeline' as insufficient to cover the upcoming cycle, triggering necessary replenishment despite the inflated in-transit numbers.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~147 to ~84 units/period (-43%) over the last 4 periods. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remains 482 (P1, P3, P4).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/05/20), the demand for SUPREME sports tights has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the peak earlier in the spring. Over the last five periods (P10-P14), average demand is 83.6 units/period, a significant decrease from the ~147 average seen previously. A massive 'In-transit' discrepancy exists: the backend reports 764 units, but historically, P1 (146), P3 (157), and P4 (179) shipments are clearly lost, totaling 482 phantom units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this inflated pipeline count, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock sufficient for (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for phantom units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = ((L+1) * 85) + 482 = (3 * 85) + 482 = 255 + 482 = 737. Setting mu_hat to 737 will force the OR engine (using base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) to see a total requirement high enough to trigger replenishment given the 764 in-transit (where on-hand is low at 22). I keep L and sigma_hat at default/recent to maintain statistical consistency while using mu_hat as the primary lever to bypass the lost-shipment inventory trap.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Integrity Alert: Period 10 (282 units) shipment is now overdue (ordered P10, promised LT=2, now P15 start). Total phantom units in 'In-transit' likely include P1, P3, P4, and potentially P10, totaling 764 units. Demand regime remains stable at ~84 units/period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the SKU '680262006' (sports tights) is in a stocking crisis. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 764 units, but historical tracking confirms 482 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are lost. Furthermore, the shipment from Period 10 (282 units) is now 5 periods overdue (Promised LT=2, 3 periods late), making it highly likely to be lost as well. This brings total phantom inventory to approximately 764 units, meaning the OR backend thinks we are fully stocked while we are actually empty. To force a replenishment order despite the inflated 'In-transit' tally, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock must exceed the phantom 764 units plus expected demand. Recent demand (P10-P15) has stabilized at a lower regime of ~82 units/period. For a (L+1)=3 period window (LT=2), expected demand is ~246. Target base stock = 246 (demand) + 764 (phantom offset) + 120 (safety stock) \u2248 1130. By setting mu_hat = 1130, I ensure the backend (base_stock - 764) generates a net order of ~360 units to break the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' confirmed at 764 units (P1=146, P3=157, P4=179, P10=282). All overdue shipments reaching 3+ periods beyond promised lead time are considered lost. Replenishment requires mu_hat to be explicitly set above phantom levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sports tights has shifted significantly since Period 10, averaging approximately 76 units/period (P10-P16: 81, 83, 97, 74, 83, 75, 40), down from the previous average of ~147. Additionally, the supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from P1 (146), P3 (157), P4 (179), and P10 (282) are now severely overdue and categorized as lost. These phantom units (totaling 764) persist in the 'In-transit' tally (1143 total - 379 fresh from P16), preventing the OR backend from ordering. To force replenishment and account for these lost units while reflecting the lower demand regime, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=2 and mean_demand ~75, (3 * 75) + 764 = 989. However, there is a fresh order of 379 in transit from P16. Total pipeline needed = 989. To trigger a new order that covers future demand despite the 1143 'In-transit' block, I set mu_hat to 1300 to ensure the backend sees a deficit and orders to maintain availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand dropped further to 40 units, bringing the recent 7-period average to ~76 units/period. Total confirmed lost shipments (phantom inventory) remain at 764 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/06/10), the product (Sports Tights) is experiencing a seasonality-driven demand decline following a peak earlier in the spring. Demand has dropped from a peak of ~145 units/period to an average of ~69 units over the last 8 periods, with the most recent two periods (P16-P17) falling significantly to 40 and 29 units respectively. In-transit inventory (947 units) remains heavily contaminated by phantom units. Specifically, orders from P1 (146), P3 (157), P4 (179), and P10 (282) are verified lost (exceeding promised lead time by 5+ periods), totaling 764 phantom units. Real pipeline consists only of the order from P17 (183 units). Including on-hand inventory (350), real inventory is 533 units. Using a current demand estimate of ~40 units/period across the (L+1)=3 periods, we need roughly 120 units. With 533 real units, no new orders are necessary. To prevent the OR backend from triggering a premature order due to its lack of awareness regarding lost shipments, I will set mu_hat explicitly to include the 764 phantom units plus the required stock for current demand (3 periods * 40 units = 120), totaling 884. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety) roughly offsets the phantom in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Demand has dropped sharply to <40 units/period (29 most recently), confirming a seasonal decline from the early spring peak. Pipeline phantom inventory (confirmed lost) remains constant at 764 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), the SKU 680262006 (Sports Tights) is experiencing a clear seasonal decline. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level, with the last two periods recording only 29 units each, compared to the spring peak of ~140-170. The current on-hand inventory is 321 units, which is ample to cover the new demand regime for several periods. The backend 'In-transit' count of 947 units is heavily inflated by 764 phantom units from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10). However, the recently placed order from Period 17 (183 units) is likely still valid and in-transit. To prevent unnecessary orders while maintaining a safe stock level during this low-demand phase, mu_hat is set using a recent N=3 average (~29 units/period) multiplied by (1+L=3), totaling 87. This explicit setting effectively signals to the OR backend that existing inventory (even minus phantom units) is more than sufficient, thereby avoiding further overstocking as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at seasonal low: Average demand for the last 3 periods is ~33 units/period, down from the mid-spring average of ~84. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remains 764.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for sports tights has stabilized at a seasonal low, with a 3-period average of 27 units (P17-P19: 29, 29, 24). This is a significant drop from the spring peak (~140) and mid-spring levels (~84). My Current on-hand inventory is 297 units, which is approximately 11 periods of stock at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' count of 947 units includes 764 confirmed phantom units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and now P10 as it is 10 periods overdue). The actual pipeline contains 183 units ordered in Period 17, which should arrive soon (promised LT=2). Given the extreme overstock on-hand (297) relative to current low demand (avg 27), I must prevent any further ordering. I set mu_hat using the recent_N (N=3) method to reflect the seasonal low (approx 3 * 27 = 81), and since (81 - pipeline_inventory) will be deeply negative regardless of phantom vs. actual units, the backend will correctly place zero orders. I use L = default as the lead time variability is high, but the policy will lead to zero orders regardless.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at seasonal low (P17-P19): Average demand is ~27 units/period. Overstock situation exists with 297 on-hand units vs. current demand. Phantom units in 'In-transit' remain 764 (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in a sustained seasonal low-demand regime for sports tights. Demand has plummeted from an early spring average of ~147 down to a recent 4-period average (P17-P20) of approximately 23 units/period (29, 29, 24, 10). The current on-hand inventory is 287 units, which is more than sufficient to cover over 12 periods of demand at the current rate. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' count of 947 units is heavily inflated by 764 'phantom units' (identified as lost shipments: P1=146, P3=157, P4=179, P10=282). Even with these lost units in the tally, the remaining valid pipeline (P17 order of 183 units) plus current on-hand inventory creates a significant overstock situation. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this new low-demand regime. This will result in a base_stock level far below our current inventory, effectively pausing all replenishment until stock levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: 4-period average (P17-P20) is 23 units/period, confirming a deep seasonal trough compared to previous averages. Total confirmed lost shipments (phantom inventory) remain 764 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/08. Demand for sports tights has reached a deep seasonal trough, with the last 5 periods (P17-P21) averaging 22.4 units/period, down from the earlier mid-spring average of ~84 and the peak of ~147. We currently have 267 units on-hand, which covers over 10 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' count of 947 is heavily distorted by 764 units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10). However, given our high on-hand inventory relative to the current low-demand regime, we do not need to place any orders. The goal is to minimize holding costs while the existing stock depletes. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the recent low-demand regime (last 5 periods) and use default lead time, allowing the system to naturally avoid ordering until on-hand stock is lower.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: 5-period average (P17-P21) is 22.4 units/period, confirming a sustained seasonal low in summer demand for sports tights.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for sports tights has reached a deep seasonal trough (summer), with the average for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) being approximately 20.5 units/period. The most recent demand (P22) was 11 units. On-hand inventory is 256 units, which is enough to cover over 12 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' count of 947 is heavily distorted by 764 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10) resulting from supply chain failures earlier in the season. Additionally, the shipment from P17 (183 units) is now overdue (ordered P17, promised LT=2, now P23 start), increasing potential phantom inventory to 947 units. Given the significant overstock and the seasonal low, no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this regime: L = default (2), mu_hat is tuned to the recent 6-period mean (~20.5 * 3 = 61.5), and sigma_hat reflects the recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: 6-period average (P17-P22) is 20.5 units/period, continuing the sustained summer seasonal low. Shipment from Period 17 (183 units) is now classified as lost (6 periods since order), increasing total phantom inventory to 947 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a deep summer seasonal trough for sports tights (July). Demand has dropped significantly: the last 7 periods (P17-P23) show an average of 18.8 units/period, with the most recent three periods (P21-P23) averaging only 13.3 units/period. The on-hand inventory of 247 units is more than sufficient to cover this demand for the foreseeable future. The 'In-transit' figure of 947 is confirmed to be composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P17). Since the backend policy uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and our pipeline_inventory (947) is massively overinflated compared to any reasonable base_stock for a 13-20 unit/period demand regime, we would need to set \u03bc\u0302 extremely high just to trigger an order. However, given our high on-hand stock and the current seasonal low, no replenishment is desired. Therefore, I will set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the most recent 7-period regime to accurately reflect the low demand, which will result in no new orders being placed while we bleed off existing on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: 7-period average (P17-P23) is 18.8 units/period, demonstrating a continued seasonal decline in mid-summer. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remains 947.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29 (Period 25). We are in the mid-summer seasonal trough for sports tights. Demand has continued to decline, reaching a new low of 6 units in Period 24. The 8-period average since Period 17 is approximately 17.25 units/period. On-hand inventory is 241 units, which covers over 14 weeks of current demand. Pipeline integrity remains severely compromised with 947 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) that are confirmed lost but inflate the 'In-transit' count. Since we have a significant overstock (241 units) relative to the current low demand regime (~17/period), we do not need to order. To ensure the OR backend does not place an order despite the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the low-demand trough and use the default lead time. No explicit value is needed because the on-hand inventory already far exceeds the calculated base stock required for this demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: 8-period average (P17-P24) is 17.25 units/period, confirming a deep seasonal low. Demand has trended downwards for 4 consecutive weeks (20, 11, 9, 6). Total phantom inventory remains 947 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Demand for sports tights is in a deep seasonal trough, consistent with mid-summer. The last 9 periods (P17-P25) have seen demand drop from early spring highs (~145) and mid-spring levels (~84) to a very low average of approximately 16.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P24-P25) is even lower, averaging around 8.5 units. On-hand inventory is 230 units, which covers over 13-27 weeks of current demand. Regarding \u2018In-transit\u2019, there is a cumulative 947 phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) that are confirmed lost as they are many periods past their promised lead time (L=2) and have not arrived. Since actual on-hand inventory is already high relative to current demand, and the backend 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by lost shipments, no new orders are desired. I will set mu_hat to a very low value based on recent demand trends, and sigmat_hat accordingly, to prevent the OR engine from ordering against these phantoms until the stock-on-hand is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: 9-period average (P17-P25) is 16.5 units/period, with the last 4 periods (P22-P25) averaging only 9.25 units/period. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remains 947 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are in a deep mid-summer seasonal low for the 'SUPREME tights'. Demand has been consistently declining and has reached single digits (last period demand was only 4). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 8.2 units/period. On-hand inventory is 226 units, which is enough to cover current demand levels for over 25 periods. There is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 947 units, all of which are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from the base stock to calculate the order, and we are currently heavily overstocked (holding cost of $1/unit is significantly higher than necessary), we must set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to reflect the low demand. We do not need to order anything, and the backend will naturally not place orders given the high on-hand and phantom in-transit values.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: 5-period average (P22-P26) is 8.2 units/period, representing a significant seasonal trough for sports tights. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remains 947.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the product (sports tights) is in a deep seasonal trough. Demand over the last 6 periods (P22-P27) has averaged approximately 9 units/period. The on-hand inventory of 213 units is sufficient to cover this demand for over 20 weeks, creating a significant overstock situation. Additionally, there are 947 'phantom' units in the in-transit pipeline (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17) which are confirmed lost but still counted by the OR backend. To prevent the system from placing any new orders while we burn through the 213 on-hand units, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the current low-demand regime (~9 units/period). Given the backend logic (base_stock - inflated_pipeline), the existing 947 phantom units alone would block ordering even if on-hand was zero, but aligning the parameters with the current 9 units/period ensures we don't carry excess holding costs for future replenishment cycles until inventory is truly needed.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for sports tights is in a deep seasonal trough, consistent with mid-to-late summer. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P22-P28) is approximately 8.5 units/period, significantly lower than the early-year average. We currently have 207 units on-hand, which at the current consumption rate, covers over 20 periods of demand. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 947 units consists entirely of 'phantom pipeline' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17). Because the current on-hand inventory is massively in excess of the desired base stock for this low-demand regime, and holding costs are being incurred, no new orders should be placed. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the inflated phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' where N=7 to reflect the current low-demand reality. The backend will naturally calculate a low base stock and, seeing on-hand inventory (207) > base stock, will result in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: 7-period average (P22-P28) is ~8.5 units/period, confirming the deep summer seasonal trough. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remain at 947 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, entering the transitional period between summer lows and potential autumn spikes in fitness apparel demand. Historical analysis shows demand for SKU 680262006 has been in a sustained deep summer trough, with a 5-period average (P25-P29) of only 7.8 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 202 units, which provides over 25 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate. Additionally, the backend 'In-transit' figure of 947 units is composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17), meaning the OR backend incorrectly perceives a massive oversupply. However, since the internal on-hand inventory (202) is already far above the safety stock requirements for the current demand regime (~30-40 units total base stock), no new orders are necessary. I am setting L to default (2), mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8-period regime (N=8) to reflect the low demand and prevent further overstocking while holding costs accumulate.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for sports tights is in a deep seasonal trough, consistent with late summer. Over the last 9 periods (P22-P30), demand has averaged 8.4 units/period, with the most recent sample at 11 units. The 'In-transit' count of 947 units is composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17). Current on-hand inventory is 191 units, which at the current demand rate (~8-10 units/week) provides over 19 weeks of cover. To avoid incurring further holding costs, no new orders should be placed. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=9) to reflect the current low-demand regime. This keeps the base stock level significantly below the combined on-hand and phantom in-transit units, resulting in zero new orders from the OR backend.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for sports tights has reached a prolonged seasonal trough, with the last 10 periods (P22-P31) averaging approximately 8.4 units per period. The most recent demand (P31) was 8 units. We have 183 units on-hand, which covers over 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 947 units is composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17). Because the backend OR engine believes these 947 units are coming, and they exceed any reasonable base stock level for the current demand regime, the engine will not place new orders. This is desirable given our massive overstock relative to the seasonal low. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 10 to reflect the current low-demand stability (avg ~8.4) while maintaining the default lead time. No new orders are needed or expected.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (late September 2019), demand for sports tights remains in a deep seasonal trough. The average demand over the last 11 periods (P22-P32) is approximately 7.8 units/period. Current on-hand inventory is 180 units, which covers over 20 weeks of demand at this rate. The 'In-transit' figure remains heavily inflated by 947 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). Given the extreme overstock resulting from the seasonal decline, no replenishment is needed. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 10 to reflect the current low-demand regime (~7.5 units/period), resulting in a base stock significantly lower than the current inventory, which will correctly prevent further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand remains in a deep seasonal trough (early autumn); average demand over the last 11 periods (P22-P32) is ~7.8 units/period. No replenishment required due to significant overstock (180 units on hand).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for sports tights is in a sustained seasonal trough, with an average of approximately 7.8 units/period over the last 12 periods (P22-P33). We currently have 172 units on hand, which is sufficient to cover more than 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 947 units is composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 that are confirmed lost as they are many multiples of the promised lead time overdue). Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, it will not place a new order as long as (on-hand + in-transit) exceeds the base stock level. Given the current overstock (172 units), no new replenishment is desired. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to reflect the low-demand regime, and sigma_hat likewise, which will result in a base stock level far below our current on-hand inventory, effectively preventing any unnecessary ordering while minimizing holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for SUPREME sports tights is in a deep autumn seasonal trough. Over the last 13 periods (P22-P34), the average demand is 8.0 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 164 units, which is approximately 20 weeks of supply at the current consumption rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 947 units is composed entirely of phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). Given the extreme overstock relative to current demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N (N=13) to reflect the low-demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the reduced volatility. The backend will naturally calculate a base stock well below the current (on-hand + phantom) inventory, resulting in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal trough confirmed (P22-P34): Average demand is 8.0 units/period. Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remains 947.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME' sports tights is in a prolonged seasonal trough. Over the last 14 periods (P22-P35), demand has averaged approximately 7.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 3.1. The system shows 161 units on hand and 947 units 'In-transit'. However, 947 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1=146, P3=157, P4=179, P10=282, P17=183) that persist in the backend pipeline count. Despite these phantom units, the 161 units physically on hand are more than sufficient to cover the current demand regime (161 / 7.6 \u2248 21 periods of stock). Therefore, no replenishment is needed. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the phantom 'In-transit' units and to keep the base stock level below current visibility, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to reflect the low-demand trough. This will result in a base stock significantly lower than the perceived pipeline + on-hand, ensuring an order of 0.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (October 21, 2019), the demand for sports tights remains in a deep seasonal trough. The average demand over the last 15 periods (P22-P36) is approximately 7.8 units per period. Currently, there are 153 units on-hand, which is sufficient to cover nearly 20 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 947 units consists entirely of 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 17 which are long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the current on-hand inventory (153) significantly exceeds any reasonable base stock level calculated from current demand (~8 units/period) and lead time (2 periods), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=15 to reflect this sustained low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend correctly identifies the overstock status and does not place unnecessary orders.

The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for 'Supreme Tights' remains in a sustained deep seasonal trough typical for late autumn, with a 15-period average (P22-P37) of 7.6 units/period. On-hand inventory is 143 units, which provides approximately 18 periods of cover at current demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 947 units is composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) and should be disregarded for replenishment calculations. Given the significant overstock and low seasonal demand, no new orders are necessary.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-04 (Period 39). The product is 'Sports tights', which experienced high demand in early spring (avg ~147), moderate demand in late spring (avg ~84), and is currently in a deep seasonal trough that started in mid-summer. Over the last 17 periods (P22-P38), demand has averaged approximately 7.8 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 134 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 9 periods of the game (39-47) at the current demand rate (~7.8 * 9 = 70.2 units). Additionally, the backend 'In-transit' count of 947 units is composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory (shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 that are confirmed lost). These phantom units prevent the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is set extremely high. However, because on-hand inventory is already high relative to demand and the game is nearing its end, no further replenishment is needed or desired, as it would only increase holding costs without increasing sales. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime to prevent any accidental ordering by the backend.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is H&M Sport tights, currently in the late autumn season (Nov 11). Demand has been in a sustained seasonal trough since Period 22 (late summer/early autumn), with an average demand of approximately 7.2 units per period over the last 15 periods. On-hand inventory is 131 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 18 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 947 units consists entirely of phantom inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17), which significantly inflates the pipeline count. However, since the current on-hand inventory is so high relative to the low seasonal demand, no new orders are required. The OR backend will naturally not order as long as on-hand plus in-transit exceeds the base stock calculation. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=15) to reflect the low demand regime and prevent unnecessary holding costs, while keeping L at default.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal trough (P22-P39): Average demand is 7.2 units/period. Overstock continues (131 units vs ~7 units demand). Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remains 947 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the demand for sports tights remains in a deep seasonal trough typical of the late autumn/pre-winter transition. The average demand over the last 19 periods (since P22) is approximately 7.5 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 127 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 17 periods of demand at the current rate. There is a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory (947 units) in the 'In-transit' status, consisting of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 17. Because the on-hand inventory is already far in excess of the base stock requirements for the current demand regime and the phantom pipeline inventory further prevents the OR backend from ordering, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current low demand. No replenishment is necessary or desired at this stage. I am using recent_N=19 to capture the entirety of the sustained low-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for sports tights remains in a very low seasonal trough, with the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging only 6.4 units/period. On-hand inventory is 121 units, which covers approximately 19 periods of demand at the current average. Total 'In-transit' inventory is 947 units, all of which are confirmed lost phantom units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). Since the on-hand stock is far higher than the projected demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game, no replenishment is required. Setting mu_hat to a minimal value (3 periods of average demand, ~19 units) ensures the OR backend does not trigger an order, given the high on-hand and phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Period 42 saw a significant demand spike to 30 units, compared to the previous 20-period average of ~7 units. This likely signals the start of a pre-holiday/winter demand regime for sports tights, as people move workouts indoors or seek thermal layers. Despite this increase, current on-hand inventory (91 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 3-4 periods of demand even at this higher rate. The 'In-transit' count remains heavily inflated by 947 'phantom' units (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17). Because the backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of these phantom units prevents the system from ordering. However, given we are at Period 43 of 47 and have 91 units on hand against an expected demand of ~30/week, we will likely exhaust stock exactly as the game ends or shortly before. No new order is desired to avoid high holding costs and potential leftover stock at the game's conclusion. I will set mu_hat using a recent 3-period window (P40-P42) to capture the trend change while relying on the massive phantom pipeline to suppress further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Demand increased to 30 units (from ~7 avg), likely signaling the beginning of winter/holiday seasonality for sports tights.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262006 (Sports Tights) is exiting its deep summer/autumn trough (approx. 7-8 units/period) and entering the winter/holiday season. We observed a demand spike to 30 units in Period 42, though Period 43 returned to a low of 3 units. Based on historical data from Period 1 (late winter), demand was significantly higher (avg ~147), suggesting we are at the start of a multi-week recovery. Currently, we have 88 units on-hand. The backend 'In-transit' count of 947 is compromised by confirmed lost shipments (phantom inventory) from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 17. The OR backend will not order as long as it believes this inventory exists. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed (In-transit + On-hand) to trigger a replenishment before the on-hand stock is depleted by further holiday demand. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for these phantoms. I am targeting a base stock roughly 150 units above the phantom level to ensure a fresh replenishment order arrives for the mid-winter peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery signaled by Period 42 spike (30 units) following a 20-period trough (~7 units/period). Total phantom units in 'In-transit' remains 947 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45, mid-December. The product (SUPREME sports tights) exhibits strong seasonality. After a long summer/autumn trough (averaging ~7 units/period), we saw a spike to 30 units in Period 42, likely signaling a winter/holiday demand recovery. The 'In-transit' count of 1189 is heavily inflated by 947 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). Subtracting these phantoms gives an effective pipeline of 1189 - 947 = 242 units (ordered in Period 44). Current on-hand is 84. Total effective inventory is 326 units. Given the recent spike and the time of year, I'm setting mu_hat using N=3 to capture the transition from the trough (average including the spike is ~12.3, which per (1+L) logic leads to a base stock covering the holiday period). No replenishment is triggered currently because effective inventory (326) comfortably covers the forecasted demand for the remaining 3 periods of the game. I will keep mu_hat conservative to avoid further overstocking as the game nears conclusion.

Carry-over insight: Sustained seasonal trough (P22-P41) ended in P42 with a spike to 30 units, suggesting holiday demand recovery. Effective in-transit is 242 units; total phantom units remain 947.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), in the middle of the winter/holiday season. While a demand spike was noted in Period 42 (30 units), subsequent demand has returned to lower levels (3, 4, 6 units), suggesting the recovery is uneven or specific to events. My current inventory strategy must account for severe pipeline issues: the 'In-transit' count of 1189 is heavily inflated by 947 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17). The actual pipeline contains only the Period 44 order (242 units). On-hand inventory is 78. Total effective inventory is 320 units. With projected demand around 10-20 units/period (giving a holiday-weighted buffer), there is no need for new orders. I will set mu_hat conservatively to avoid triggering orders while the effective inventory is sufficient, keeping in mind the backend will subtract the inflated 1189 from its base stock calculation. No change to L or sigma_hat is needed as we are not ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-53.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (end of December). Historically, demand for sports tights spiked in Feb-April (avg ~147) and then collapsed during the summer/autumn (avg ~7-8). Period 42 saw a spike to 30 units, suggesting a potential holiday recovery, but the last four periods (P43-P46) have averaged only 4.5 units, indicating the P42 spike was an isolated event (perhaps Black Friday) rather than a sustained regime shift. The current in-transit inventory of 1189 units contains 947 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) which are confirmed lost. The recent order from P44 (242 units) is still within the promised lead time of 2 periods. On-hand inventory is 73 units, which is more than enough to cover the current low demand (~5 units/period). With 242 units truly in-transit and 73 on-hand (total 315), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 10-period average (P37-P46, avg ~8.4) to reflect the current low-demand environment. The OR engine will see the 1189 in-transit units and refrain from ordering, which is correct given our overstock relative to demand.
