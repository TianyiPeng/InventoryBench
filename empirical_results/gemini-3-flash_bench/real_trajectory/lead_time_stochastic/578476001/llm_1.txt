This is a staple wardrobe item with superstretch twill, likely having stable demand with a slight uptick as spring approaches. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows demand ranging from 54 to 78, with a recent upward trend (59, 59, 54, 63, 78). The four-week average is ~64 units. Given the date (Feb 11), we are entering the spring shopping season. c) Lead Time & Inventory: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. An order placed today (P1) will arrive in P3. d) Forecast: I expect demand for P1, P2, and P3 to be around 70-80 units per period as the trend is rising. To cover demand for P1, P2, and P3 (the pipeline until the first order arrives), I need enough stock for 3 periods. 3 periods * 75 units = 225 units. e) Action: Since I start with 0, I will order 230 units to cover the pipeline and establish a small safety stock, accounting for the recent demand growth from ~60 to 78.",

The order placed in Period 1 (230 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in P4 start). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 230 (scheduled for Period 3). We expect demand for P2 and P3 to be ~75 each (Total 150), so the 230 in-transit covers us through Period 3. e) Order Logic: To maintain a safety stock and cover the lead time (L=2, so we look at demand for L+1 = 3 periods: P2, P3, P4), we need enough inventory to cover ~225 units. The current in-transit (230) covers this. However, since we had 0 sales in Period 1 due to 0 on-hand, we have missed demand. I will place a moderate order to start building a cycle that accounts for the 2-period lag and ensures we don't stock out in Period 5.",

Total in-transit is 310 (230 from P1, 80 from P2). I need to cover demand for lead time L+1. Assuming L=3, I need enough stock to cover P4, P5, P6, and P7. Total demand (4 periods * ~75) = 300.

Inventory Status: On-hand is 88 units. There is an extremely large 'In-transit' quantity of 300 units. Looking at the history, orders from P1 (230 units) and P4 (70 units) are confirmed lost (they are $>10$ periods overdue). However, these lost units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation $(230 + 70 = 300)$. Therefore, the actual pipeline is empty. Demand Forecast: Given the seasonal decline, I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at approximately 20-25 units/week (total 60-75). Since current on-hand inventory is 88, I already have enough stock to cover the lead time and a safety buffer without incurring unnecessary holding costs on a declining product.

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'skinny' trouser, typically seeing high demand in Autumn/Spring. Current calendar date 2019/12/02 indicates we are moving into the December holiday season following the late Autumn peak. Demand has shown high volatility (P41: 92 vs P42: 188). The average demand over the last 4 periods is ~137 units/week. Pipeline analysis: Total In-transit is 1130 units. Based on established carry-over insights, 680 units are confirmed lost (P17, P26, P29, P34, P38). This leaves an active pipeline of 450 units (orders from P40, P41, P42). Lead times are highly variable (1-3 periods). Inventory on-hand is 0. With approximately 5 periods remaining in the simulation, and an active pipeline of 450 units (covering ~3.3 weeks of demand at the recent average), I need to ensure coverage for the lead time plus current period (L+1). Given current lead time performance and stockouts in P42, I will order slightly above the recent mean to capture the late-year demand surge while remaining cautious of the 450 units already coming in.",

Period 44 (2019/12/9) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The recent demand reflects a typical year-end retailing cycle for trousers, with a sharp decline from the late-Autumn/post-Black Friday peak (188 units in P42) to a moderate level in early December (72 units in P43). Given the current date (2019/12/09) and the product type (skinny superstretch trousers), demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease further as the season ends. The active pipeline consists of orders from P42, P43, and the new order for P44. Cumulative lost units (P17, P26, P29, P34, P38) total 680, which are removed from the nominal in-transit figure of 980, leaving an active reliable in-transit volume of 300 units (from P42 and P43). Current on-hand inventory is 228 units. Estimating an average demand of ~70-80 units/week for the remaining 4 periods, total needed coverage is approximately 320 units. Total available stock (On-hand 228 + Reliable In-transit 300 = 528) already provides more than enough coverage to last through the final period (P47), even accounting for lead time volatility. Ordering more would only incur significant holding costs (1.0/unit) for stock that will not sell before the game ends.",

  "rationale": "We are in Period 45 of 47, specifically December 16th. Demand analysis shows a significant cooling from the Autumn peak (~150+ units/week) to a December average of ~92 units/week (P43-P44 average). This aligns with the seasonal lifecycle for 'Womens Tailoring Trousers', which generally sees a drop-off in late December. My on-hand inventory is 116 units. The in-transit pipeline officially shows 980 units, but a reconciliation of history indicates that 680 of these units are long-term lost shipments (P17: 300, P26: 30, P29: 50, P34: 150, P38: 150). The 'live' reliable pipeline consists of orders from P42 (150) and P43 (150), totaling 300 units. Combined with the 116 units on-hand, I have 416 units available to satisfy the final 3 periods (P45, P46, P47). Given the current demand trend of approx. 80-100 units/week, 416 units is more than sufficient and likely to result in leftover stock.

  "rationale": "We are currently at Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019) with only Period 47 remaining. The SKU '578476001' (Wichy 5pkt slim trouser) is a seasonal garment. Historical data shows that demand is winding down at the end of the calendar year (P43-P45 demand: 72, 112, 125). Current on-hand inventory is 291 units. Given that holding cost ($1.00) is significant relative to profit ($4.00), and we have more than enough stock to cover the final period's demand (estimated at ~120 units), any additional inventory arriving now would only incur unnecessary holding costs at the conclusion of the game. Total in-transit inventory is ostensibly 680, but most of this consists of confirmed lost shipments (approx 680 units total lost as of P42 notes). Regardless of whether any 'ghost' units arrive, the 291 on-hand units are sufficient to meet the remaining demand for the final period.
