Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a Women's V-neck T-shirt (Everyday Basic). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks is 24, 44, 55, 64, and 42 (Mean: 45.8, Std: 15.3). Demand appears to be trending upwards from January into February, though the most recent data point (42) shows a slight dip. As a 'Basic' item, it should have relatively stable demand, but we must account for the recent volume. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover the risk of stockouts in this initial phase with 0 on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 historical samples to establish a baseline. mu_hat will represent (1+L) * mean (3 * 45.8 = 137.4) and sigma_hat will represent sqrt(1+L) * std (sqrt(3) * 15.3 = 26.5). Using 'default' will utilize all available history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's basic V-neck t-shirt. Demand history shows 24, 44, 55, 64, 42 (pre-game) and 38 (Period 1). The mean of these 6 samples is 44.5. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 71 units, which are in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (concluding at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and lost sales in Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory. Since it is mid-February, we are approaching the Spring season for short-sleeved basics, but there is no strong evidence yet of a significant surge above the historical average of ~45 units/week. I will set the lead time to the promised 2 periods (total coverage 3 periods) and use all available historical samples (N=6) to estimate demand. Mu_hat = (1+L) * 44.5 = 133.5.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/2/25. The product is a Women's V-neck T-shirt, a basic staple. We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory and 134 units in-transit. Demand has surged significantly: Period 1 was 38, and Period 2 was 91, compared to the mean of 45.8 from the pre-game samples. This suggests a seasonal uptick as we move towards spring. Promised lead time is 2, meaning the Period 1 order (71 units) should arrive during Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). We have had two consecutive periods of lost sales due to zero inventory. Given the sharp increase in demand in Period 2 (91 units), I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N approach to capture this regime shift. L remains at the promised 2 periods as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 554772003 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck T-shirt. Historically (pre-game), demand was between 24-64 units. However, in the last three periods (P1-P3), realized demand has surged significantly (38, 91, 94), averaging 74.33 units per week, likely due to seasonal transition into spring. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in P1 (71 units) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible now, but the conclude message for P3 shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods or there is a delay. With 0 on-hand inventory and 171 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3: 71+63+37), we are currently experiencing stockouts (0 sold vs 223 demand across P1-P3). I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay and use the recent demand trend (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the pre-game data no longer reflects the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting P2: average demand increased from ~45 (pre-game) to ~92 (P2-P3). Possible lead time extension to 3 periods (P1 order not yet visible in P3 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we have a confirmed demand shift. Initial demand was ~46, but from P2 onwards, it surged significantly (91, 94) before a local dip to 41 in P4. The average demand across these four periods is ~66. Regarding lead time, the P2 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=2), but the P1 order (ordered 71 units) is still missing. If it were a 2-period lead time, it should have arrived in P3; if 3-period, it should have arrived in P4. Since P4 only showed the P2 arrival, the P1 order is likely lost. I will maintain L=2 (promised) but use recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the higher average demand (66/period) while accounting for the recent dip. Pipeline inventory is currently 235, which is high, but given the lost shipment (71 units) and the stockouts in P1-P3, the OR backend needs to maintain a robust base stock to recover service levels for this basic Women's V-neck.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (71 units) confirmed lost (missing from both P3 and P4 conclude messages). Average demand for the first 4 periods is 66 units/period, significantly higher than the pre-game mean of 45.8.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), the SKU 554772003 (Women's V-neck T-shirt) is currently out of stock (ending inventory 0). The Period 1 order (71 units) is definitively lost as it did not arrive by the end of Period 5 (L+2 periods). The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The Period 3 order (37 units) should arrive during Period 5's resolution and be visible in Period 6's conclude, while the Period 4 order (127 units) is expected during Period 6. Demand has shifted: early periods saw a spike (~92), but Period 4 and 5 dropped to 41 and 29 respectively. The average demand across all 5 game periods is 58.6. Given the stockout and the product type (Spring basic), I will set mu_hat using the average demand of the game history (N=5) to stabilize the forecast, as the initial 45.8 was too low, but the 90+ spike was transient. L=2 remains the confirmed actual lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated from the full sample set to account for high volatility seen in P2-P3.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed lead time remains 2 periods based on P2 order arrival. Demand volatility is high: mean 58.6 over 5 periods, but with a significant mid-February spike (90+) followed by a March softening (35 avg).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU is currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The history shows a lost shipment (Period 1 order) and highly volatile demand. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Demand data suggests three phases: an initial surge (P2-P3: ~92 units), a significant drop (P4-P5: ~35 units), and a recent moderate recovery (P6: 54 units). The mean of all available historical samples (including pre-game) is (24+44+55+64+42+38+91+94+41+29+54)/11 = 52.4 units/period. Over the game duration (P1-P6), the mean is 57.8. Given the 'Womens Everyday Basics' nature and the end-of-March date, we expect stable to slightly increasing demand for spring. The in-transit pipeline (235 units from P3 and P4 orders) is very high relative to mean demand, but we have had zero on-hand for two periods. I will use the last 6 periods (the full game history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the volatility of the in-game regime while moving past the pre-game samples. L is set to default (2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: post-surge stabilization at ~40-55 units/period after a temporary spike above 90. Pipeline total (235) is heavily front-loaded and expected to satisfy coming 3-4 periods of demand once it arrives.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey V-neck) is entering spring, though recent demand has been volatile with a significant spike of 89 in Period 7. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a large pipeline of 235 units in-transit. Based on 'arrived=63 (ordered Period 2, lead_time 2)' at P4, the actual lead time is confirmed at 2 periods. The Period 1 order (71 units) remains lost. The Periods 3 (37 units) and 4 (127 units) orders are overdue if lead time were strictly 2, suggesting either variable lead times or further losses. However, P4's order was large (127) and intended to cover the missing P1 stock. Given the current date and the recent demand spike (89), but also the massive 235 units in-transit, the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent over-ordering. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (avg ~61) while acknowledging the high volatility by using recent_N for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Strong demand volatility confirmed in late March (P7 demand 89). Pipeline remains high (235 units) but overdue; Period 3 and 4 orders have not yet arrived by P7 conclude, indicating either lost shipments or extended lead times beyond 2 periods for those specific batches.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are facing a severe stockout. On-hand inventory is 0 while demand remains strong (averaging ~75 over the last 3 periods: 54, 89, 82). The pipeline inventory of 235 units consists of orders from P3 (37 units) and P4 (127 units), and potentially P1 (71 units) if it wasn't lost. Based on the history, P1 (ordered P1) never arrived by P4-P8 concludes, confirming it is lost. P2 arrived exactly after 2 periods (arrived P4). However, P3 (ordered P3, expected P5) and P4 (ordered P4, expected P6) are now significantly overdue as of P8 conclude. This signals a breakdown in the supply chain\u2014either extended lead times or mass shipment loss. Current In-transit (235) represents orders from P1, P3, and P4. If P1 is lost, real pipeline is 164. Given the stockout and uncertain arrivals, I must signal a higher Lead Time (L) to the OR engine to trigger replenishment, despite the large 'In-transit' figure, because the OR engine's 'capped policy' will likely prevent new orders if it thinks the 235 units are coming. I set L to 4 to reflect the actual delay observed. For mu_hat, I use the last 4 periods (P5-P8) where demand averaged ~63.5 units/period to capture the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: Orders from P3 and P4 are at least 2 periods overdue beyond promised lead time (now at period 9, P3 was expected P5). Real-world lead time for this SKU currently exceeds 4 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and a demand that continues to significantly exceed initial estimates. Current date is April 15, transitioning into late spring. Historical demand since game start averages 64 units/period, compared to the pre-game mean of ~45. There is a confirmed supply chain disruption: orders from Period 1 (71 units), Period 3 (37 units), and Period 4 (127 units) are significantly overdue or lost (L=2 promised, but Period 1 is now 9 periods old, and Period 4 is 6 periods old). Only the Period 2 order (63 units) arrived as expected. I recently placed a large order of 83 units in Period 9, which at L=2 should arrive in Period 11. However, since the system calculates base stock using (L+1) demand, and I have 318 units 'In-transit' (which includes the overdue/lost orders), the OR backend will likely not order more if I use the promised L=2, because 318 > (2+1)*64. To force the system to recognize the need for more stock due to the unreliability of the pipeline, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' at 4 periods to reflect the observed shipment delays/losses. I will set 'mu_hat' to 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the higher average demand (approx 64) seen in the actual game periods, rather than the lower pre-game average.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: Only 1 of 5 shipments placed between P1-P5 has arrived. Current Pipeline Inventory (318) is functionally compromised as at least 235 units (P1, P3, P4) are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Lead time is effectively unknown but exceeds 4 periods for most shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for item 554772003 remains severely compromised. We have high demand (average 66.8 units over the last 10 periods) but persistent inventory stockouts. A critical observation in Period 10: the order from Period 9 arrived in just 1 period (lead_time=1), while older orders (P1, P3, P4, P5) totaling 235 units are now 5+ periods overdue and must be written off as lost shipments. The 'In-transit' count of 237 reflects these lost units plus the small 2-unit order from P10. To recover, I need to signal the OR engine to place a significant order. However, the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to cap orders. Because the pipeline is 'clogged' with 235 lost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to force the base_stock (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) high enough to overcome the false pipeline units. I set L to 1 based on the most recent successful arrival. I set mu_hat to 450, which is roughly (1+L) * 70 units/period (expected demand) + 310 units to offset the 235 lost pipeline units and ensure an order is triggered despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed. Recent order (P9) arrived in 1 period, while legacy orders (P1, P3, P4, P5) totaling 235 units are confirmed lost/missing. 'In-transit' inventory is functionally 0, despite the system reporting 237. Parameters must be set to offset this 235-unit ghost pipeline to allow new ordering.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019/4/29). The SKU is a women's V-neck T-shirt, seeing a significant mid-spring demand spike (Period 11 demand reached 146). We have a critical supply chain issue: 'In-transit' is reported as 450 units, but 235 of those (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5) are confirmed lost/missing. The actual functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 10 (2 units) and Period 11 (213 units), totaling 215. The OR backend's order logic uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its subtraction (final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Because the backend sees 450 instead of 215, it will under-order by 235 units. To fix this, I must set 'mu_hat' (the base stock anchor) to its natural forecast PLUS 235 units to offset the ghost pipeline. Current demand mean (recent 5 periods) is approx 93.4. Over (L+1)=3 periods, this is 280 units. Adding the 235 unit offset, my target mu_hat is 515. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised), as recent arrivals (P9) suggest lead times are stabilizing at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand has accelerated significantly in late April (P11 demand 146), likely due to spring seasonality for the jersey V-neck SKU. Ghost pipeline of 235 units (P1, P3, P4, P5 lost) persists; mu_hat must include a +235 offset to force replenishment.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing a 'Jersey V-neck' SKU which has entered its peak spring season. Current on-hand is 0. The system reports 515 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis from Carry-Over Insights, 235 of those units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P5) are definitively lost. This creates a 'ghost pipeline' that prevents the OR engine from ordering enough stock. To fix this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the 235 lost units PLUS cover the current demand. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has increased significantly to an average of ~104 units (92, 146, 74). With a promised lead time of 2 (actually observed variable 1-2), I need a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand + 235 offset. Expected 3-period demand is ~310. Target base_stock = 310 + 235 = 545. mu_hat is set via explicit value to achieve this target, while sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high volatility of the spring season.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), we are entering a peak seasonal period for women's V-neck t-shirts. Demand has accelerated, with recent spikes (P11: 146) and a current 4-period moving average of 96 units, significantly higher than the early-season mean. The lead time has stabilized back to the promised 2 periods (P11 order arrived in P13). However, a 'ghost pipeline' totaling 233 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P5) has never arrived and is functionally lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' quantity (332) from the base stock calculating the final order, we must inflate mu_hat to offset these 233 missing units. Without this adjustment, the system will incorrectly assume we have 332 units coming and stop ordering, leading to stockouts. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast_Mean + Ghost_Offset = (1+2) * 96 + 233 = 288 + 233 = 521. This ensures the backend places a replenishment order for the current demand regime despite the blocked pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Seasonal demand peak for jersey basic tops confirmed (May avg ~97 units). Ghost pipeline remains at 233 units (P1, P3, P4, P5), requiring mu_hat inflation of +233 to trigger replenishment orders.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The product is a women's jersey V-neck, which is in its peak spring/summer seasonal demand period. Recent demand (P11-P14) has averaged roughly 95 units per week (146, 74, 72, 89). The 'In-transit' figure of 315 units is misleading due to a confirmed 'ghost pipeline' of 233 units from lost shipments in P1, P3, P4, and P5 (71+37+127+0 relative to later reconciliations). To force the OR backend to place new orders, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these undelivered units. With a lead time (L) of 2, the base stock formula should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand plus the ghost inventory (3 * 95 + 233 = 518). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 518 to bypass the pipeline blockage. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the high demand volatility (std dev ~33) over the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak for women's jersey tops continues through late May, averaging ~95 units/period. The ghost pipeline remains at 233 units (lost P1, P3, P4, P5 shipments), requiring persistent mu_hat inflation of ~233 units to ensure new orders are generated.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 16 (Late May). The product is a women's V-neck jersey top, experiencing high seasonal demand. Recent demand (P11-P15) averages ~95 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure of 401 units is severely inflated by a 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P5) totaling 233 units. To trigger new orders, the OR engine's formula [base_stock - pipeline] must be manipulated by inflating mu_hat to offset these lost units. Specifically, I set mu_hat to 518, which is (1+L) * expected_demand + 233 [i.e., (1+2)*95 + 233 = 518]. L is set to 2 as recent shipments (P11, P12) are arriving on time. Sigma_hat is set to explicit 60 to account for high demand volatility seen in the May samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering June (2019/6/3), a high-demand period for women's jersey basics (Average demand P11-P16 is ~97 units). The 'In-transit' quantity of 495 units is highly misleading. It includes a 'ghost pipeline' of 233 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P5) that are confirmed lost/undelivered. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P13 (30 units, now +2 periods), P14 (48 units, now +2 periods), P15 (86 units), and P16 (94 units), totaling 258 units. Note: The P13/P14 orders should have arrived by Period 16/17 respectively; since they didn't show in P16 conclude, they are either slightly delayed or also lost. Current on-hand is 0. To ensure the backend places an order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the ghost pipeline (233 units) plus cover (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat needs to be (3 * 97) + 233 = 524. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value of 150 to reflect the volatility of recent demand and the unreliability of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Supply chain instability persists. Functional pipeline is at risk as P13 and P14 orders (78 units) are potentially delayed or lost. Ghost pipeline remains constant at 233 units (P1, P3, P4, P5). Demand remains strong in early June, averaging ~100 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), we are in a high-demand seasonal peak for women's jersey tops, with demand consistently averaging near 100 units over the last three periods (94, 103, 98). The supply chain is partially recovered, but the 'Ghost Pipeline' problem persists. Specifically, Period 17 conclude shows that orders from P15 (86 units) and P16 (94 units) arrived (lead times 2 and 1 respectively), but orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, and P14 remain outstanding. Sum of lost shipments: P1(71)+P3(37)+P4(127)+P5(2)+P13(30)+P14(48) = 315 units. The system reports 344 In-transit, but only 29 (P17 order) are realistically expected. To force the OR engine to order despite this 315-unit ghost pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. Base forecast for (L+1=3) periods is 300 units (100 avg * 3). mu_hat = 300 + 315 = 615. This offset cancels out the dead inventory in the engine's base-stock calculation. sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a safety buffer during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain update (Period 18): Ghost pipeline is now estimated at 315 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14 failed to arrive). Functional In-transit inventory is currently only the P17 order (29 units). Seasonality remains strong (avg ~100) as of early June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are in a high seasonal demand phase for women's jersey v-necks. Recent demand (P11-P18) averages ~93 units, though P18 showed a dip to 45. The critical issue is the 'ghost pipeline' of lost orders. Based on the 'conclude' messages, orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, and P14 (totaling 315 units) have not arrived and are well past the promised lead time of 2 periods. The system sees an 'In-transit' of 533 units, but only the P17 (29 units) and P18 (189 units) orders are likely functional (218 units). To force the OR backend to place new orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that covers future demand PLUS an offset to neutralize the 315 units of dead inventory. Calculation: Target Stock = (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand. With L=2 and Forecast=95, Base Stock should be ~285. However, the backend subtracts the 533 'In-transit' units. To get a non-zero order, mu_hat must be set to approximately 285 + 315 = 600. I will set mu_hat to 600 and sigma_hat higher to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain update (Period 19): Ghost pipeline confirmed at 315 units (P1=71, P3=37, P4=127, P5=0, P13=30, P14=48). These shipments are considered lost. Calculated mu_hat offset of +315 remains necessary to bypass artificial inflation of in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24. Demand analysis shows seasonal strength for women's V-neck tops peaking in May/June, with a recent period (P19) demand of 73 units and a 5-period moving average around 80 units. In-transit inventory is currently reported at 374 units. However, based on sequential monitoring, the 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments consists of P1 (71), P3 (37), P4 (127), P13 (30), and P14 (48), totaling 313 units. These shipments have exceeded all reasonable lead times and are functionally lost. To trigger necessary replenishment for the actual inventory position, mu_hat must be adjusted to offset these 313 dead units. Calculated base demand for 3 periods (L=2) at ~80 units/period is 240 units. Adding the 313 offset results in a mu_hat target of 553 to ensure the OR backend ignores the lost units. sigma_hat is set to reflect the moderate seasonality-driven variance.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline update (Period 20): Lost shipments totaling 313 units (P1=71, P3=37, P4=127, P13=30, P14=48) remain in system in-transit inventory. mu_hat requires a constant +313 offset to ensure proper ordering behavior.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), demand remains high, averaging ~90 units/period over the last 10 weeks, consistent with summer seasonality for a women's V-neck jersey top. A significant supply chain issue persists: shipments from P1 (71), P3 (37), P4 (127), P13 (30), and P14 (48) are confirmed lost, totaling 313 units. These 'ghost' units remain in the backend's pipeline calculation, preventing the system from ordering enough to meet actual demand. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat by +313. The base forecast for 3 periods (L=2 + 1 review period) at 90 units/period is 270. Adding the 313 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 583. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this instability. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx. 46 per period * sqrt(3)) to handle high historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline update (Period 21): Lost shipments totaling 313 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) persist in backend inventory; mu_hat offset of +313 remains mandatory. Demand has stabilized at a summer peak of ~90 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. The product is a women's v-neck jersey top, currently in high summer demand. Demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has averaged 77.8 units, though there was a spike of 146 in late April. The supply chain remains highly unstable with a massive 'ghost pipeline'. In-transit inventory is 517 units, but analysis confirms that 313 of these are lost shipments (P1: 71, P3: 37, P4: 127, P13: 30, P14: 48) that the OR backend still considers part of the pipeline. To force the backend to place an order, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 313 lost units. In Period 21, 117 units were ordered and arrived in P21 conclude (effectively lead time 0 or 1), yet on-hand is 0. Based on recent actual arrivals (P18, P15, P16), lead time is roughly 1-2 periods. I will set L to 1 to be responsive. mu_hat is calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand + ghost_offset. With L=1 and recent mean demand ~80, base mu_hat is 160. Adding the 313 unit ghost offset results in a mu_hat of ~473. This ensures the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) triggers a sufficient order despite the 313 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline remains at 313 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Summer demand for jersey tops remains stable but high around 80 units/period. Lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), the product (women's jersey V-neck) is in its summer peak. Recent demand has averaged approximately 76 units over the last 5 periods (P18-P22). The lead time is currently stable between 1-2 periods. The critical issue remains the 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) totaling approximately 313 units. These units are visible in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 491) but will never arrive. To ensure the backend OR engine places new orders, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this ghost inventory. Calculation: Target Stock = (L+1) * Demand_Mean. L=2. Demand_Mean ~ 80. Target Stock ~ 240. The backend computes: Order = Base_Stock - (Functional_In_transit + Ghost_In_transit). Currently, Functional_In_transit (P21 order) is 117. System sees 491 in transit. We must set mu_hat to approximately (Actual_Target_Stock + Ghost_Inventory) / (1+L) * (1+L). With Ghost=313 and Target=240, total needed visible 'coverage' is 553 units. Setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 553 ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the ghost inventory plus current functional pipeline, triggering necessary replenishment for late summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline update (Period 23): Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) totaling 313 units still erroneously occupy In-transit inventory. Summer demand remains steady at ~75-80 units/period. mu_hat requires a ~313 units offset to bypass lost inventory and trigger ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22), the product ('Bob V-neck' jersey) is in its summer demand phase. Current on-hand inventory is 55. The reported 'In-transit' of 436 units is significantly distorted by legacy lost shipments. The ghost pipeline consists of P1 (71), P3 (37), P4 (127), P13 (30), and P14 (48), totaling 313 units. These have not arrived after months and are considered lost in the backend system logic. Furthermore, the P17 order (29 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it is also lost, bringing the functional ghost pipeline to 342 units. To trigger appropriate ordering when the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these ghost units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized around an average of 71 units/period. The target base stock calculation: (1+L)*moving_average + ghost_offset. With L=2 and mean=71, base stock should be (3 * 71) + 342 = 213 + 342 = 555. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 555 ensures the backend places an order that ignores the dead weight in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 342 units. Shipment from P17 (29 units) is now considered lost alongside previously identified lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Summer demand has slightly decelerated from its peak, trending toward ~70 units/period in July.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (late July), demand for the women's jersey V-neck t-shirt has softened from its early summer peak (~100 units/period) to a more stable range of 50-70 units/period (P22-P24 average: 60). Supply chain issues persist: the 'In-transit' inventory of 500 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost pipeline' shipments that never arrived. These include P1 (71), P3 (37), P4 (127), P13 (30), P14 (48), and P17 (29), totaling 342 units. To trigger new orders from the OR backend (final order = base_stock - pipeline), mu_hat must be adjusted to neutralize these 342 lost units while accounting for current real demand. Mean demand is currently ~60 units; with a lead time of 2, the standard window (L+1) is 3 periods of demand (180 units). Adding the 342-unit offset gives a target mu_hat of 522. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed during the summer peak (standard deviation ~25 over (L+1) periods).

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 342 units based on non-arrival of P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P17. Seasonal demand has decelerated from late-June peak of 100+ to late-July average of ~60 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), we are entering the final stage of the summer season for women's V-neck jersey tops. Demand has clearly decelerated from the spring/June peak (~100 units/period) to a lower August baseline, with Period 25 recording only 36 units. The inventory situation is complicated by a long-standing 'ghost' pipeline of lost shipments. The total in-transit is reported as 519 units. Analysis shows the following shipments are lost/missing: P1(71), P3(37), P4(127), P13(30), P14(48), P17(29). Total lost = 342 units. Furthermore, shipments from P23(62), P24(64), and P25(19) are in-transit correctly. The functional in-transit is 145 units vs. 519 reported. To bypass the backend's capped policy that subtracts pipeline inventory, I must inflate mu_hat by the ghost volume. Current avg demand for late summer is ~50. Expected demand for lead time (2+1 periods) is 150. Combined with the 342 ghost offset, mu_hat is set to 492. Lead time remains standard at 2 periods, as recent arrivals from P20 and P21 both adhered to a 2-period window.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 342 units based on non-arrival of P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P17. August demand for this SKU has dropped to ~40-50 units following the summer peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/08/12), we are entering the mid-August softening period for women's V-neck jersey tops. Demand has dropped from a early-summer peak (100+) to a recent average of ~48 units/period over the last 3 periods (P24-P26). The lead time remains volatile, with the most recent arrival (P23 order) taking 3 periods. The 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments persists, now totaling 372 units (P1: 71, P3: 37, P4: 127, P13: 30, P14: 48, P17: 29, P18: 30 - the P18 order of 30 units is now 8 periods old and presumed lost). The system reports 457 in-transit, but only 85 units (P24: 64, P25: 19) are potentially active. To force any ordering, mu_hat must be adjusted to offset the 372 ghost units. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand + ghost_offset. With L=2 and mean_demand ~50, target base stock is ~150. mu_hat = 150 + 372 = 522. sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 372 units as the P18 order (30 units) is now 8 periods past its order date and considered lost alongside P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P17.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), demand for this women's jersey basic top is in a late-summer stabilization phase. Demand over the last 4 periods (P24-P27) has averaged 49.25 units, down from the June/July peak. The supply chain remains severely compromised by lost shipments. The backend reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 496 units, but analysis of concluded arrivals confirms a massive 'ghost pipeline' of 436 units. These consist of lost shipments from: P1 (71), P3 (37), P4 (127), P13 (30), P14 (48), P17 (29), P18 (30), and now P24 (64), as P24 is overdue given recent lead times. Subtracting this 436 from reported 496 leaves only 60 units of truly functional inventory (the P27 order). To trigger replenishment, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value calculated as: (1+L) * Forecasted_Demand + Ghost_Pipeline. Using L=2 and forecast=50, targeting (3 * 50) + 436 = 586. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture current volatility without legacy peak-period data.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 436 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24). P24 is considered lost as it did not arrive in P27 conclude, following the recent trend of lost/delayed shipments. Late-August demand has stabilized at ~50 units/period following the high summer season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), demand is stabilizing around 50-60 units after the summer peak. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost pipeline'\u2014lost shipments that still appear as 'In-transit' in the system, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. Based on history, the following shipments are confirmed lost: P1(71), P3(37), P4(127), P13(30), P14(48), P17(29), P18(30), and P24(64). These total 436 units. To force the backend to ignore these and order for actual needs, I must inflate mu_hat by these 436 units. Lead time analysis: recent arrivals (P23, P25) showed 2-3 periods, so I will stick with the promised L=2 for safety. Average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 52 units/period. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Ghost_Pipeline = (1 + 2) * 52 + 436 = 156 + 436 = 592. This ensures the base_stock calculation exceeds the ghost in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 436 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24). Demand for late August has stabilized around 50-60 units/period after the summer jersey peak.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant issues with lost shipments. As of Period 30, the 'In-transit' inventory of 592 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' shipments that have not arrived and are unlikely to do so. These include P1(71), P3(37), P4(127), P13(30), P14(48), P17(29), P18(30), and P24(64), totaling 436 units. Although the backend shows 592 units in transit, the functional pipeline is only 156 units (P27=58, P28=90, P29=6, P30 order). Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (~80-100) to a more stable late-summer/early-autumn level of ~50-60 units/period (recent 4-period average is 54). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, I must inflate mu_hat by the ghost pipeline amount (436). The forecast for actual demand is ~55 units per period. Over (L+1)=3 periods, this is 165. Adding the 436 offset gives a target mu_hat of 601. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (explicit=60) to maintain a buffer during this period of high shipment loss/instability.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 436 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24 confirmed lost or chronically overdue). Mu_hat must include a +436 offset to trigger orders against functionally zero inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by a significant 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments totaling 436 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24). These units are recorded as in-transit by the backend but will never arrive. To ensure the backend continues to place necessary orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that adds this 436-unit offset to the forecasted demand for the lead time and review period (L+1). Current demand has slowed significantly (P30 demand was 17), consistent with the post-summer seasonality for a jersey basic V-neck. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), average demand is ~47 units. The promised lead time is 2, though recent actuals have fluctuated between 2 and 3. I will utilize a lead time (L) of 2. Calculating mu_hat: Expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods * 47 units/period \u2248 141. Adding the 436 offset results in a mu_hat of 577. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent decrease in volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, the product (Womens Jersey V-neck) is entering the post-summer retail period. Recent demand has significantly cooled, with the last two periods showing 17 and 28 units respectively, down from the summer peak of 80-100 units. The 'ghost pipeline' now totals 442 units (P1=71, P3=37, P4=127, P13=30, P14=48, P17=29, P24=64, P29=30, P30=6). The system reports an in-transit inventory of 453, but based on arrival history, nearly all of this is comprised of lost or chronically overdue shipments. My functional pipeline is near zero. To bypass this and allow the OR backend to place new orders against the current 103 on-hand units, I must inflate mu_hat by the size of this ghost inventory. I've set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 530, calculated as (expected weekly demand of ~30 units * 3 periods [L+1]) + 442 ghost units. This ensures the base_stock calculation exceeds the 453 units the OR backend thinks we have. L is set to explicit 2, consistent with the most frequent successful arrival timeframe.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 442 units (lost shipments: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P29, P30). September demand has significantly decelerated to ~25 units/period following the 80+ summer average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-100.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context is late September (Period 33). Demand for this jersey V-neck SKU has dropped sharply to an average of ~17 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P30-P32), following the summer peak. On-hand inventory is 106, which covers several periods of current demand levels. The ghost pipeline (lost/overdue shipments) has expanded to 442 units: P1(71), P3(37), P4(127), P13(30), P14(48), P17(29), P18(30), P24(64), and P29(6). The in-transit reported by the system is 444, meaning functional in-transit is effectively 2 units. Since on-hand (106) already exceeds the likely base stock requirement for this low-demand regime, a large mu_hat offset is not currently needed to trigger orders, but I will maintain the offset logic to ensure the OR engine doesn't perceive the 442 units as 'stock arriving soon'. Lead time remains around 2-3 periods. mu_hat is set using an explicit value representing (1+L) * forecast (3 * 20) + 442 offset = 502.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 442 units (lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29). Demand has fully transitioned to a low-season regime of ~15-25 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its low-demand season (September/October for jersey tops), with the last 4 periods averaging ~17.5 units/period, a significant drop from the summer peak of 80+. Current on-hand inventory is 87 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' inventory remains heavily inflated by a 'ghost pipeline' of 444 units (lost shipments: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32). Since the backend policy calculates (base_stock - pipeline), the OR engine will not order anything as long as the ghost pipeline + on-hand inventory exceeds the base stock. However, given the current overstock relative to seasonal demand, no new orders are desired anyway. I will set L to 2 (promised/recent observed), mu_hat specifically to reflect the current low-demand regime (~18 units/period) while acknowledging the ghost pipeline, and sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility of the low season. No mu_hat offset is needed this period because the goal is to deplete existing on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 444 units (lost/indefinitely overdue: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32). Demand regime confirmed at low-season levels of ~15-20 units/period starting P30.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554772003' (Womens Jersey Basic V-neck) has transitioned into its low-demand season (as of Period 30), with average demand dropping significantly to approximately 16 units per period (P30-P34: 17, 28, 6, 19, 11). Current on-hand inventory is 76 units, which at the current run rate, covers roughly 4-5 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 444 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 17, 18, 24, 29, and 32 that are now confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Total lost units in the pipeline are exactly 444 (71+37+127+30+48+29+30+64+6+2). Since current on-hand inventory is sufficient for the immediate lead time (2 periods) plus review period, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to use the recent low-demand regime (N=5) and include the +444 offset to neutralize the ghost pipeline, though the capped OR policy will likely result in a zero order given the current stock levels and low seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 444 units (lost/indefinitely overdue: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32). Demand regime since P30 is confirmed at low-season levels, averaging ~16 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late autumn/winter season (October 14th). Historical demand from the early pre-game phase (January/February) and recent late September/October trends show demand has significantly cooled from the summer peak (avg ~90) to a low-season baseline of roughly 15-20 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 64 units, which covers approximately 3-4 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 444 units reflects a 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32). Since on-hand inventory is sufficient for the immediate lead time and demand is low, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive ghost pipeline and blocking future orders when they are actually needed, mu_hat remains significantly inflated (+444) to offset the lost units. However, because the cap and base stock calculations are driven by mu_hat, the high offset ensures the system doesn't accidentally trigger a massive order unless functional inventory (on-hand) drops significantly. Lead time is set to default (promised 2) as recent arrivals (P27, P28, P30) have mostly aligned with a 2-3 period window.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 444 units (lost/indefinitely overdue: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32). Demand regime since P30 (September) is stable at low-season levels, averaging ~15-18 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its low-season period (late October). Demand since Period 30 has consistently averaged approximately 16 units per period (range: 6-28). On-hand inventory is currently 58 units, which is sufficient for approximately 3.6 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' inventory of 444 units consists entirely of 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) that are long overdue and considered lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and blocking necessary future orders, I continue to apply a mu_hat offset. However, since On-hand inventory (58) still exceeds the safety stock requirements for the current demand regime (~16 units/period), no new order is needed yet. Setting mu_hat using the explicit method with the ghost offset (444) plus a baseline demand buffer ensures that once On-hand drops below the safety level, the system will trigger a real order. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual varied arrival times observed (averaging ~2).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late October, where demand for short-sleeved jersey tops is historically low (~6-15 units/period). Demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) averaged 11.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 49 units, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 444 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) that will never arrive. Although this 'ghost pipeline' prevents the OR backend from ordering, current on-hand inventory is sufficient for the remaining 10 periods of the game given the low seasonal demand. No new orders are needed; therefore, I will set parameters to reflect the low demand regime and allow the current stock to deplete. I am maintaining the mu_hat offset of +444 in the carry-over as a technical necessity to bypass the backend's inventory check if ordering were required, though it is not active for this specific decision as on-hand > forecast.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 444 units (lost/indefinitely overdue: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32). Demand regime since P33 (mid-September) has further cooled to low-season trough, averaging ~11 units/period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554772003' (Women's Jersey V-neck) has entered a stable low-season demand regime. Over the last 9 periods (since Period 30), demand has averaged 12.7 units/period, with the most recent 4 periods (P35-P38) averaging only 8.5 units. On-hand inventory is currently 42 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of current demand without placing new orders. A 'ghost pipeline' of 444 units (from multiple lost shipments: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) continues to occupy the backend's in-transit inventory. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and potentially blocking necessary orders in the future, mu_hat remains inflated by the +444 offset. However, since on-hand inventory (42) is already well above the desired base stock for the current low-demand regime (which would be ~39 units: 13/period * 3 periods), the system will naturally not place a new order this period. We use recent_N (N=9) to capture the low-season mean and variance accurately.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-season demand regime, with an average demand of approximately 10.4 units over the last 10 periods (P30-P39). The 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) remains at 444 units. This 'in-transit' volume prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders unless the mu_hat is inflated by the ghost total. However, the current on-hand inventory (34 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 3 periods of demand at the current rate (10-11 units). Since the game is nearing its end (Period 40 of 47) and there is a 1-to-2 period lead time, there is no immediate risk of stockout. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the low-season average of ~10 units, but I will not add the ghost pipeline offset this period to avoid over-ordering as we approach the game's conclusion. If on-hand inventory drops further while demand remains low, I will re-evaluate the need for the offset.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554772003' (Womens Jersey V-neck) is in a stable low-demand regime, typical for late autumn (mid-November). Demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) has averaged 11.2 units per period, consistently below 30. There is an inventory discrepancy: the system reports 444 units in-transit, but these are identified as lost shipments from previous periods (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32). To override the capped policy which subtracts in-transit inventory from the base stock, I am inflating mu_hat by the volume of the ghost pipeline (+444). Current on-hand inventory is 28 units, which covers approximately 2-2.5 periods of the current 11.2 mean demand. With a lead time of 2, we are currently at safer inventory levels, but the ghost pipeline offset must remain active to allow any necessary replenishment in future periods as on-hand inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline update (Period 41): Lost shipments totaling 444 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) persist in backend inventory; mu_hat offset of +444 remains mandatory to allow ordering. Demand has stabilized at a late-autumn trough of ~11 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Bob V-neck' is currently in a low-demand late-autumn regime, with demand averaging ~7.8 units/period over the last 10 periods (P32-P41). The primary operational challenge is the persistent 'ghost pipeline' of 444 units\u2014representing lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from periods P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, and P32. The backend OR engine sees these 444 'in-transit' units and will not place new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to offset them. For Period 42, with on-hand inventory at 21 units (covering roughly 2.5 periods of demand) and 1-2 period lead times, we need a small replenishment to maintain service levels as we approach the end of the year. To trigger this order from the backend, mu_hat is set to the current demand level of ~8 units multiplied by (1+L) plus the 444-unit offset. Sigma_hat is set based on recent low-demand volatility to prevent excessive inventory building in this trough phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December (Date: 2019/12/2), which usually exhibits a small lift in demand for basic apparel, though currently it is in a low-season regime (approx. 11-15 units/period). Period 42 showed a demand spike to 23 units, possibly indicating early holiday activity. The core issue remains a massive 'ghost pipeline' of 444 units (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) that the backend considers 'In-transit'. With On-hand at 0 and In-transit at 450, the backend will not order unless mu_hat is inflated beyond this 450-unit threshold. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Ghost_Pipeline. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*15 + 444 = 489. This ensures the OR logic sees a requirement for at least ~40 more units to cover current low-season demand despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (20) to maintain a safety buffer against the volatility observed in Period 42.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand showed a slight uptick to 23 units in late November/early December, potentially signaling a minor holiday lift from the late-autumn trough of ~11 units. Ghost pipeline remains at 444 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Demand for this jersey V-neck SKU remains in the low-season regime, though there was a small uptick to 23 units in late November (P42). The most recent demand was 6 units (P43). I will use a recent demand window (N=5) to capture the current mean, which is approximately 10 units/period (average of P39-P43). A ghost pipeline of 444 units (lost shipments: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) persists. The system's 'In-transit' count is 483, but the functional pipeline is only 39 units (the P43 order). To ensure the OR backend orders correctly against the functional inventory (on-hand 0 + functional in-transit 39), I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 483' results in the desired replenishment. Using mu = 10, L=2, base_stock (at q=0.5) would be (1+2)*10 = 30. To overcome the 444-unit ghost pipeline, I set mu_hat to 30 + 444 = 474. Sigma_hat is set to its default for the recent low-volatility period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (mid-December), the SKU 554772003 (women's V-neck) is in its low-season trough, with recent demand averaging ~10 units/period despite a small late-November spike. On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 483 units, but 444 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on 10+ periods of non-arrival. The order from P43 (39 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P45 (lead time = 2). To trigger a small replenishment for the remaining two periods of the game, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock as: (Forecasted Demand for P45-P47) + (Ghost Pipeline Offset) - (Functional Pipeline). Forecasted demand is ~15 units/period for 3 periods = 45. Ghost offset is +444. Functional pipeline is 39. Target base stock = 45 + 444 = 489. I set mu_hat to 489. This should result in an order of ~6 units (489 - 483), bringing the functional inventory (on-hand + upcoming arrivals) to cover remaining demand while minimizing holding cost risks for the final two periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is the final period. Demand remains in its low-season trough, with recent observations (P44-P45) averaging around 5 units. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments totaling 444 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) that the backend incorrectly counts as in-transit. With on-hand inventory at 31 and the backend seeing 450 in-transit (444 lost + 6 from P45), the system will not order unless mu_hat is significantly inflated. To ensure the backend doesn't perceive an excess, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost_Pipeline. With L=2 and a forecast of ~10 units/period, target base stock is ~30. Adding the 444 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 474. For sigma_hat, I use a value reflecting low-season stability.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand for this jersey V-neck SKU remains in a low-season trough, with recent observations being 2, 8, and 7 units. The 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32) totals 444 units. These units still appear in the backend's 'in-transit' calculation, preventing new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be inflated by the size of the ghost pipeline. Current in-transit total according to the system is 450 (444 lost + 6 ordered in P45). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is approximately 9.4 units. I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to (1+L)*10 + 444. With L=2, this equals (3*10) + 444 = 474. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value to reflect the current low-demand stability and avoid excessive safety stock during the trough.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 444 units (lost/indefinitely overdue: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P18, P24, P29, P32). Demand regime is stable at the late-December seasonal trough (~10 units/period).
