The average demand is approximately 173 units/week. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods.

I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods). e) Logic: Estimated demand for P1-P3 is ~520 units (3 * 173).

  "rationale": "The SKU is a 'Mariette Blazer', a seasonal item that typically sees peak demand during transitional weather (Spring and Autumn). Entering mid-November (Period 40), we expect demand to remain relatively steady at the current regime (avg ~295 units/period) before potentially cooling as Winter approaches. Analysis of past data shows the current regime since Period 30 has fluctuated but averaged around 300 units, excluding the extreme outlier in Period 33. Supply chain reliability remains the primary concern: the system reports 3,900 units in-transit, but 3,500 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, P29, P34). Therefore, the 'True Viable Pipeline' is 400 units (representing P38 and P39 orders). With 1,206 units on-hand and 400 in-transit, our total available stock is 1,606 units. This covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (1,606 / 295 \u2248 5.4). Given the lead time is varying between 1-3 periods and the high loss rate (~50% of orders), I will place a maintenance order of 300 units to ensure the flow remains steady while mitigating holding cost risk, as inventory is currently quite high.",

Over the last four periods (P37-P40), demand has averaged approximately 302 units per week, showing stability as we enter mid-November.

The true viable pipeline includes the orders from P38, P39, and P40 (300 units each), totaling 900 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 928 units. Target inventory is calculated using a (L+1) coverage model where L is 3 periods due to volatility. For a 4-period window at ~300 units/period, the target is 1,200 units. Since current On-hand (928) + Viable Pipeline (900) = 1,828 units, we are currently over-stocked relative to immediate demand. However, given the ~50% historical loss rate of shipments for this SKU, it is prudent to place a small maintenance order to ensure flow for the final periods of the year (ending at P47), while acknowledging that a large order now risks high holding costs if the legacy pipeline suddenly clears or demand drops post-November.",

However, demand typically tapers off in December as the seasonal peak for blazers concludes. The game ends at Period 47, leaving only 5 periods (including this one). The current on-hand inventory is 250. The reported In-transit of 4100 is highly distorted by historical losses.

This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 600 units (300 from P38, 300 from P40, 200 from P41). P38 is now 5 periods old and likely lost, while P40 is 3 periods old and might arrive. With 250 on hand and potentially 200-500 arriving, and demand expected to return to a baseline of ~250-300 units/period (post-surge), I have enough stock to cover the 2nd/3rd period. Ordering now (Period 43) with a 2-3 period lead time means arrival in Period 45 or 46, very close to the game end.

Historical December demand (P44-P45) has averaged 281 units. However, given we are in the penultimate period (P46), we must ensure we have enough inventory for P46 demand and potentially some for P47, but we must be extremely cautious not to over-order and incur significant holding costs at the end of the simulation. \n\nInventory Assessment: \n- On-hand: 419\n- In-transit: 3700 units (Reported), but Carry-over insights confirm that 3,800 units are actually lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, P29, P34, P38).

However, given that this is the final period, the priority shifts to liquidating current stock and avoiding holding costs on surplus inventory that cannot be sold. The 291 units on hand are likely sufficient to cover the final period's demand without adding more to the pipeline.
