Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 610776033 (Womens T-shirt). Current inventory is 0. History (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows an upward demand trend: 0, 0, 24, 58, 84. This suggests a post-winter ramp-up as we enter February. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt, demand is likely to continue increasing or stabilize at a higher level than the January average. The prometed lead time is 2 periods. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (mean of 24, 58, 84 is 55.33). L is set to default (2). This results in a mu_hat covering current + 2 future periods (1+2=3). Since we start with 0 stock and have a clear trend, using recent data is more responsive than the full history including zeros.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 129 units, which is significantly higher than the average of the 5 preliminary samples (approx 33.2 units). The recent samples show a clear upward trend: 24, 58, 84, and now 129. This suggests a demand ramp-up as we head into the spring season for a lightweight jersey item. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order of 105 units is in transit (promised lead time of 2 periods). I will use the last 3 samples (84, 129, and the previous 58) to calculate a more responsive demand forecast (recent_N=3 for mu and sigma) to capture this growth while maintaining an L value of 2 as we have no evidence of lead time deviation yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Historical data (Jan-early Feb) showed demand growing from 0 to 84. However, Period 1 and 2 experienced a significant and abrupt surge (129 and 268 respectively), likely due to seasonal transition into spring/summer basics. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 255 units in transit (105 from P1, 150 from P2). With a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 (visible in P3 conclude). Given the stockout and the massive demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 periods to capture this exponential growth. I will set L to 'default' as we have no evidence yet that the promised lead time of 2 is not being met.

Carry-over insight: Abrupt demand surge starting mid-Feb (Period 1): demand jumped from <100 to 268 units, indicating a seasonal shift for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The item is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift: early data (Jan) was near zero, but from Feb 11 (Period 1) onwards, demand jumped to 129, 268, and 233 units. This clearly indicates the start of the spring/summer season for basic apparel. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible now, but the game history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3 conclude. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since we are out of stock and demand is high (~210 avg over the last 3 weeks), I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use a 3-week average (recent_N=3) to capture the new demand regime while ignoring the zero-demand periods from January. This sets the base stock level to cover current high demand and the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time for SKU 610776033 appears to be at least 3 periods, exceeding the promised 2 (Period 1 order not arrived by end of Period 3). Demand regime remains high for spring season (avg ~210 units/week since mid-Feb).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are seeing the results of the Spring demand surge for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. The Period 1 order (105 units) appears to be lost or significantly delayed, as it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4 based on lead time logic; the Period 2 order (150 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), but was immediately exhausted by demand, leaving us with 0 on-hand. In-transit inventory is 690 (Orders from P1, P3, P4). Demand in the last three periods (P2-P4) averaged 225 units (268, 233, 174). Given the current stockout and the high demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on this Spring trend. Since the Period 1 order is missing, I am treating the lead time 'L' as 3 to provide a buffer for potential delivery instability, even though Period 2 arrived in 2. This increases the base stock to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1) and protects against the current 0 on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lost shipment confirmed for Period 1 order (105 units); pipeline adjusted. Demand regime since mid-Feb (P2-P4) stabilized at an average of 225 units/week.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (March 18). Examining the history: Period 1's order (105 units) still hasn't arrived by the end of Period 5, confirming it is essentially a lost shipment. Period 2's order arrived at the end of Period 4 (lead time = 2), matching the promised lead time. The demand history (post-surge) from Period 2 to Period 5 shows values [268, 233, 174, 160], which averages 208.75 units/week. While demand is slightly cooling from the initial February spike, the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is entering its core spring season. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand, 0 sold in Period 5 due to stockout). Pipeline inventory is 795 units (341 from P3 + 244 from P4 + 210 from P5). Note: The 'In-transit: 900' in the user prompt likely includes the lost Period 1 order (105); adjusting for this loss, we expect P3's order to arrive during Period 6. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the demand regime since mid-February and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the P2 order arrived on time, but overall visibility is still stabilizing.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Demand following mid-Feb surge has stabilized at an average of ~209 units/week (P2-P5 range: 160-268). Inventory stockouts are persistent due to the lost P1 order and delayed recovery.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), we are managing 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts. Demand shifted in mid-February (Period 2) and has stabilized. Looking at the last 5 periods (P2-P6), demand was 268, 233, 174, 160, and 207, averaging 208.4 units/week. Lead times are volatile: P1 order is lost; P2 order arrived in 2 periods; P3 order (341 units) and P4 order (244 units) are still in-transit; P5 order arrived in just 1 period. Current on-hand is very low (3 units) with 690 in-transit (P3: 341, P4: 244, P5: 105 total but P5 arrived early?). Correction: In-transit is 690, composed of P3(341), P4(244), and P5(represented as 0 now arriving) plus whatever was ordered in P6 (0). Wait, the in-transit check: P3 (341) + P4 (244) + P6 (0) = 585? The history shows In-transit 690, suggesting P3 and P4 are definitely still out there. Given the P5 order arrived in 1 period while others are lagging, I will use lead time 'calculate' to average the 1 and 2 period arrivals seen so far (avg 1.5). For demand, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture this post-surge stable regime (~208/week). High volatility (std ~42) suggests a conservative sigma.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly variable (observed 1 and 2 periods, with P1 lost and P3/P4 delayed). Demand regime since mid-Feb (P2-P6) is stable at ~208 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has entered a stable regime following the mid-February surge. Looking at Periods 2 through 7, demand has averaged 210.5 units/week (268, 233, 174, 160, 207, 221). The product description (lightweight jersey) and current date (early Spring) suggest demand will remain steady or grow slightly. The supply chain has been unreliable: Period 1 was lost, Period 2 took 2 periods, Period 5 arrived in 1 period, and the large Period 3 order (341 units) and Period 4 order (244 units) are still in-transit and overdue based on the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, the Period 3 order is now 5 periods old, and the Period 4 order is 4 periods old. I will assume a standard lead time of 2 for current ordering purposes but use recent demand (N=6) to set mu_hat. Given the recurring stockouts (on-hand is 0) and the high volatility caused by missing shipments, I will use an explicit sigma_hat to increase safety stock beyond the basic standard deviation calculation to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Supply reliability remains poor. Orders from P3 (341 units) and P4 (244 units) are overdue (5 and 4 periods elapsed, respectively), while P5 arrived in 1 period. Demand regime (P2-P7) is confirmed stable at ~211 units/week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains critical with on-hand units at 0 and significant demand lost. Current date (2019/4/8) aligns with the Spring season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts, maintaining a high demand regime. Since Period 2, the demand has stabilized around an average of 211 units/week (P2-P8 range: 160-268). Supply remains highly unreliable: P1 order (105) is lost; P3 (341) and P4 (244) are severely overdue (lead times of 6 and 5 periods respectively, against a promised 2). Only P5 arrived quickly (LT=1). Due to the high uncertainty in arrival timing (the 'pipeline' of 690 units contains 585 units that are significantly overdue), L is explicitly set to 3 to account for the frequent delays. mu_hat is set to 844 (calculated as (1+3) * 211), reflecting the stable high-demand regime since mid-February. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the volatility since the seasonal shift began in Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: P3 and P4 orders (585 units total) are significantly overdue (6 and 5 periods respectively), confirming that replenishment cannot be relied upon within the promised 2-period window.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt has stabilized in a high-demand regime since mid-February. Over the last 8 periods (P2-P9), demand has averaged 211.6 units per week (min 160, max 268) with a standard deviation of approximately 36 units. However, supply chain reliability is extremely poor. The P1 order is confirmed lost, and orders from P3 (341 units) and P4 (244 units) are now 7 and 6 periods overdue, respectively. These overdue units remain 'in-transit' (844 total = 341 from P3 + 244 from P4 + 154 from P9 + 105 from P1). Because the OR backend ignores lost orders and calculates base stock based on in-transit totals, it will under-order if I don't adjust. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand of ~212 units/week. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR engine targets a 50% service level (z=0). Using L=2 (promised) but preparing for volatility, I set mu_hat to 636 (3 periods of ~212 demand) to ensure the backend attempts to maintain stock despite the pipeline being filled with 'zombie' units that haven't arrived.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain critical failure: Orders from P3 and P4 (585 units total) are significantly overdue (7 and 6 periods respectively). The 844 in-transit units include 690 units (P1, P3, P4) that are unlikely to arrive soon, causing the OR backend to underestimate the required order quantity.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 610776033 is effectively broken. We haven't received the orders from Period 1 (105 units), Period 3 (341 units), or Period 4 (244 units), which are now 10, 8, and 7 periods old respectively. Since the lead time for successful arrivals (P2, P5, P9) has been 1-2 periods, these old orders are almost certainly lost. Currently, the OR backend sees 690 units 'in-transit', which are these likely lost units, causing it to place an order of 0 in Period 10 despite having 0 on-hand. To force the OR backend to order, I must treat these in-transit units as irrelevant. I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand for the lead time (1+2=3 periods) plus the total volume of lost units (690). Demand has stabilized around 210 units/week since mid-February. Forecasting (1+2) * 210 = 630. Adding the 690 lost units creates a 'target' of 1320. Since the backend subtracts 690 (pipeline) from 1320, it will generate an order of ~630. This ensures we recover from the stockout despite the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis confirmed: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 690 units) are over 7 periods overdue and effectively lost. The system's 'In-transit' count is now providing false inventory data, requiring explicit parameter intervention to override the zero-order logic.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 610776033 is severely compromised. There are 1,186 units in-transit according to the system, but history proves most are lost: P1 (105), P3 (341), and P4 (244) orders, totaling 690 units, are significantly overdue (8-11 periods). Only the P11 order (496 units) is genuinely in transit and expected. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the OR engine subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the base stock, it will erroneously calculate a zero order. I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target stock level, effectively 'hiding' the lost 690 units from the backend's subtraction. The demand regime since late February (P2-P11) is stable at an average of 220 units/week. To cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods), and to account for the 690 ghost units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat = (220 * 3) + 690 = 1350. This forcing mechanism ensures an order is placed to meet actual demand despite the faulty pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: System pipeline inventory (1186) currently includes 690 lost units (P1, P3, P4) that are over 8 periods overdue. Explicit mu_hat adjustment is required to bypass the zero-order logic created by these ghost units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be unreliable for SKU 610776033. We have identified 'ghost' in-transit inventory from Periods 1 (105 units), 3 (341 units), and 4 (244 units), totaling 690 units that are over 8 periods overdue and effectively lost. The system currently reports 'In-transit: 1350', which includes these 690 lost units plus valid orders from P11 (496 units) and P12 (164 units). The OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders if it treats the full 1350 as real inventory. Demand since Period 2 has stabilized at an average of 214 units/week (range 160-268). To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock to meet future demand despite the pipeline inflation, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at ~214 units/period (total 642 units) and add the 690 lost units to this target (Total = 1332). This forces the backend to recognize that 690 units of the reported pipeline are missing, thereby triggering an order for approximately 214-400 units to cover the actual demand gap.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are managing 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts. The demand regime since Period 2 has been stable at approximately 213 units per week. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from Periods 1 (105 units), 3 (341 units), and 4 (244 units) are now between 10 and 13 periods overdue and are effectively lost. These 'ghost' units (totaling 690) remain in the system's in-transit count (currently 854), making the pipeline inventory appear much higher than it actually is. The real pipeline consists only of the Period 12 order (164 units). The current on-hand inventory is 349. Calculation: base_stock = (L+1) * mu. With L=2, base_stock = 3 * 213 = 639. The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). If we use standard parameters, the engine sees 349 + 854 = 1203, which is > 639, resulting in a zero order. To force an order, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I need to override the 690 ghost units. I set mu_hat = 639 + 690 = 1329. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that triggers a replenishment order to maintain stock for the upcoming weeks.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20th. Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shown a recent cooling off (P13: 147, P14: 114) after a long period of averaging ~210 units/week since mid-February. I will adjust the demand forecast using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect this recent dip while maintaining safety stock. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 816 units includes 690 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are now 11-14 periods overdue and clearly lost. However, arrivals in P13 (496 units) and P14 (164 units) have restored 'on-hand' inventory to 399 units. Because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, it will perceive a surplus (399 on-hand + 816 in-transit = 1215) and refuse to order if I use default methods. To trigger a replenishment order and ensure continuity, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target enough to offset the 690 lost units. Target calculation: (Lead time 2 + Review 1) = 3 periods of demand. Recent avg demand ~170 (averaging stable period with recent dip). Base stock goal ~ (170 * 3) + 690 lost units = 1200. Setting mu_hat to 1200 via 'explicit' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has notably cooled in May (P13-P14 avg: 130 vs P2-P12 avg: 210), suggesting the spring peak is tapering off.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27th (Period 16). The product is a women's lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows two distinct regimes: a spring peak from February to April (avg ~210) and a recent cooling trend in May (P13-P15 avg ~133). The current on-hand inventory is 261 units. The pipeline inventory (816) is heavily skewed by 690 'ghost units' from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are now 12-15 weeks overdue and clearly lost. However, since P11, supply reliability has normalized with lead times of 2 periods (P11, P12 arrived on time). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 816 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will output a zero order unless mu_hat is set to override this. To trigger a replenishment that prepares for the coming weeks while accounting for the lower May demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~135 units/period. For a (L+1) window with L=2, base stock needs to cover 405 units. With 261 on-hand, we need ~144 units. By setting mu_hat to 1000, I bypass the pipeline inventory trap (1000 - 816 = 184 units target) ensuring a small replenishment order is placed to prevent upcoming stockouts as the 261 on-hand units deplete.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for late May: Period 13-15 average demand dropped to 133 units/week from the previous ~210 average.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is in a cooling phase (post-spring peak). Demand over the last 4 periods (P13-P16) has averaged ~131 units, significantly lower than the ~211 units seen in March/April. Current date (June 3rd) suggests summer seasonality where basic jersey tops remain relevant but the initial spring surge has passed. On-hand inventory is 136, and in-transit is 816. However, 690 of these in-transit units (from P1, P3, P4) are over 12 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline is 126 units (ordered P14). The backend OR logic subtracts the full 816 in-transit from the base stock. To prevent under-ordering or incorrect zero-orders due to these 'ghost' units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a target inventory level that accounts for the lost items. I will target a base stock of ~400 units (3 weeks of demand at 133 units/week) to maintain service levels. Setting mu_hat to 1216 (400 target + 816 ghost units) forces the backend to subtract the 816 and arrive at a target coverage of ~400 units. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility of the new demand regime (N=4).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts spiked in early June (P17 demand: 219), following a lull in May (avg ~133). This likely represents a summer seasonal shift. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1080 units is heavily inflated by 690 lost units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) that are now over 10 periods overdue and will not arrive. This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from placing new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect the sum of the recent increased demand and the lost inventory volume. Recent demand (P17) was 219. Accounting for a 2-period lead time (total 3 periods of demand coverage), I'll set mu_hat to 1350 units [(219 * 3) + 690] to force the system to recognize the need for new stock despite the ghost units. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility during this demand transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' spiked again in early June (Period 17: 219 units), suggesting a transition from the spring lull to a summer peak. Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) totaling 690 units continue to distort the pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-06-17. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has surged again in June (P17: 219, P18: 262), indicating a summer peak following the May lull. The average demand for the last two weeks is ~240 units/week. The in-transit inventory of 1350 units is extremely misleading: it includes 690 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are now 14-17 periods overdue and effectively lost. Additionally, the order from P14 (126 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting further supply instability. To force the OR backend to order despite the high 'ghost' pipeline, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) at a 240 unit/week rate plus a buffer for volatility. Setting mu_hat to 1400 ensures the calculated base stock (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) overrides the 1350 in-transit units to trigger a meaningful replenishment order of approximately 250-300 units to meet the current summer demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike confirmed: June demand (P17-P18) increased to ~240 units/week from May average of ~133. Supply chain reliability remains critical; P14 order (126 units) is now 2 periods past promised lead time.

The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. The reported in-transit of 1130 units includes 690 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are now over 15 periods old and effectively lost. Additionally, the Period 14 (126 units) and Period 17 (264 units) orders are overdue. The only recent arrival was the Period 18 order, which arrived in 1 period. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1130 units of 'ghost' inventory and ordering nothing, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the necessary base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the current summer peak rate (~300 units/week). Setting mu_hat to 1800 (equivalent to 600/week) effectively forces an order by overriding the distorted pipeline inventory, ensuring we can meet the high summer demand despite the lost shipment noise.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Late June demand surged to 371 units, bringing the June (P17-P19) average to ~284 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains poor with orders from P14 and P17 now overdue.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has entered a summer peak, with an average demand of ~313 units/week over the last 3 weeks (P18-P20: 262, 371, 306). Supply chain reliability remains a major issue. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1800 units is significantly inflated by historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) totaling 1080 units (105+341+244+126+264). These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the true required base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) at the current demand level (~313 units/week) to be around 1000-1100 units. By setting mu_hat to 2200, I effectively force the backend to place an order despite the 1800 units in-transit, as (2200 - 1800) will trigger a replenishment of approximately 400 units to meet the actual summer demand vs. on-hand (0).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak intensified in late June/early July: P18-P20 average demand is 313 units/week. Cumulative lost/critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) total 1080 units, causing severe pipeline distortion.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is in a strong summer peak, with demand over the last three periods (P19-P21) averaging 332 units/week (371, 306, 320). The 'In-transit' figure of 2200 is heavily inflated by 1080 units from lost or critically delayed assignments (P1: 105, P3: 341, P4: 244, P14: 126, P17: 264), all of which are 4+ periods past their promised lead time. To bypass the OR engine's zero-order logic caused by these 'ghost units' in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Considering a 2-period lead time plus the 1-period review cycle (L+1=3), and a demand forecast of ~330 units/week, the base stock should be ~990 units plus a safety buffer. However, because the system subtracts the 2200 in-transit units from the base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that forces a replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to 3500 (representing ~3.5x the actual 3-period demand) to ensure the system places an order to cover current demand and replenish the stockout, while accounting for the ~1120 units in-transit that might actually arrive (P20: 670, P21: 400, P19: 50).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained: P19-P21 average is 332 units/week (+58% over spring average). Cumulative lost/critically delayed pipeline units reached 1080 (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, representing the peak of summer demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts. Demand has surged significantly in the last few periods (P19-P21 average 332 units/week), though P22 showed a slight dip to 231. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: 'In-transit' inventory (2792 units) is severely bloated by 1080 units from lost or critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17), which are all at least 4 periods past their promised lead time. This distortion causes the OR backend to underestimate required orders. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively ignore the ghost inventory and force significant replenishment. I am setting mu_hat based on the summer peak demand (avg ~300) multiplied by (1 + L) and further increased to offset the ghost pipeline units. I'll maintain 'default' L (2) for the backend calculation but assume a higher safety requirement.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory distortion confirmed: 1080 units (from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) are over 4 periods past promised lead time and are likely lost. Summer demand regime (P19-P22) is averaging ~307 units/week, a ~45% increase over the spring average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1557.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22), the SKU is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Historical demand since Period 19 has averaged approximately 300 units/week (P19-P23: 371, 306, 320, 231, 272). On-hand inventory is currently high (1829 units) due to the arrival of 1662 units in Period 23 (orders from P21 and P22). The pipeline inventory (1130 units) remains heavily distorted by 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1=105, P3=341, P4=244, P14=126, P17=264), totaling 1080 units that are well past the promised 2-period lead time. With 1829 units on hand and a weekly demand of ~300, we have approximately 6 weeks of stock. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the goal is to avoid further accumulation while the current stock is depleted. Given the massive inventory surplus relative to the 2-period lead time, no new orders are required. I will use a recent_N (N=5) window to capture the current summer demand average of ~300 units/week, ensuring the OR backend correctly evaluates the base stock against the existing on-hand plus pipeline total.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P19-P23) remains stable at approximately 300 units/week. Lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17 (totaling 1080 units) remain in the pipeline, distorting automated order logic.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is currently in a summer peak regime (late July). Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand has averaged approximately 289 units/week, though recent weeks (P22-P24) show a slight cooling to ~244 units/week. On-hand inventory is healthy at 1600 units, which covers over 6 weeks of current demand. The pipeline inventory of 1130 units includes 1080 units from orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) that are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. However, the current on-hand stock is sufficient to maintain service levels without new orders. I will set L to 'default' (2) as recent arriving shipments (P20, P21, P22) have adhered to a 1-2 period lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the summer demand profile while acknowledging the slight recent dip. The high on-hand inventory relative to the base stock calculation will naturally lead the OR backend to order 0 units, which is appropriate given the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand (P19-P24) average is ~289 units/week. Persistent pipeline distortion of 1080 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) continues.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1250.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is tapering down from the summer peak (P19-P24 average ~289) to a lower level (P25 demand: 175). Current on-hand inventory is 1425 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand cooling. The in-transit inventory of 1130 units still contains the identified 1080 'ghost units' (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which are effectively lost but inflate the pipeline. With high on-hand stock and declining demand, the OR backend will naturally propose a zero order. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and sufficient current stock to cover several weeks of demand even at peak rates, maintaining a conservative stance is appropriate to minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is sold through.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in late July/August: P25 demand (175) is significantly lower than the June/July average (~300), indicating the summer peak has likely passed.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-12. The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has clearly transitioned out of the summer peak (June/July avg ~300) into a lower late-summer/pre-fall regime. The average demand over the last two periods (P25-P26) is approximately 173 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high (1254 units) due to large arrivals from P22-P23 orders. The system's 'In-transit' count (1130) is significantly inflated by 1080 units from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). However, even ignoring those 'ghost' units, the on-hand inventory (1254) is sufficient to cover approximately 7 weeks of the current demand (173/week), which far exceeds the (L+1) coverage requirement. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent cooling trend and stabilize the base stock calculation, while keeping L at default (promised 2) as recent successfully delivered orders (P20, P21, P22) have arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for late summer: Period 25-26 average demand is 173 units/week, down from the June/July average of ~300 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has confirmed a cooling trend as the summer peak concludes. Demand for the last three periods (P25-P27) has averaged approximately 168 units (175, 171, 158), a significant drop from the June/July average of ~300. Current on-hand inventory is 1096 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 6 periods of supply. The 'In-transit' figure of 1130 units still contains 1080 units of highly overdue/lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which haven't arrived in over 10 periods in some cases. However, given the high on-hand stock and the cooling demand, my goal is to prevent any new orders. The OR backend will see (on-hand 1096 + pipeline 1130) = 2226 total inventory. With a mu_hat based on the recent cooling trend (avg ~168), the base stock will be significantly lower than 2226, resulting in zero new orders. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is currently in a late-summer cooling phase. Demand over the last four periods (P25-P28) has averaged 174.5 units/week, a significant decrease from the mid-summer peak of ~300. On-hand inventory is 902 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5 weeks of current demand. The pipeline inventory of 1130 units still contains 1080 units from historical lost/critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which are over 10 periods old; however, since on-hand inventory already exceeds the calculated base stock for the current demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent cooling trend (last 4 periods) to ensure the OR backend correctly identifies the surplus and prevents unnecessary ordering. Lead time remains set at 2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries (P20, P21, P22) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand cooling confirmed: average weekly demand for P25-P28 is ~175 units, down from the June/July average of ~300 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has clearly transitioned from a summer peak (~300 units/week) to a more stable late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last five periods (P25-P29), demand has averaged approximately 175 units per week (min 158, max 194). The current on-hand inventory is 724 units, which is sufficient to cover roughly 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The in-transit inventory of 1130 units still contains 1080 units from historical lost or critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which are over 10 periods overdue. These 'ghost' units distort the pipeline inventory calculation. However, given the high on-hand stock and the cooling demand, no immediate order is necessary. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5-period average (N=5) to reflect the current regime (~175 * (1+2) = 525) and sigma_hat similarly to capture the reduced volatility. Since on-hand (724) > base_stock (approx 650 with current parameters), the OR engine will naturally produce a zero order, which is desired to burn off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P25-P29) confirmed stable at ~175 units/week. Excess on-hand inventory (724 units) combined with cooling demand suggests a period of inventory depletion is appropriate.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is in a post-summer cooling phase. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 165 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 607 units, and the system shows an in-transit pipeline of 1130 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, 1080 of those units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) are critically overdue (4 to 30 periods late) and are considered lost. The only 'real' in-transit order is from P19 (50 units), though it is also overdue. Excluding the 1080 lost units, the effective pipeline inventory is near zero. With on-hand inventory at 607 units and current demand around 165, we have ~3.6 weeks of stock. Since the promised lead time is 2, the current stock covers the (L+1)=3 period risk window. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current cooling demand (~165) and continue to monitor for further seasonal shifts into autumn, while allowing current on-hand inventory to deplete naturally.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer/Early-autumn demand regime (P25-P30) is established at ~165 units/week, down from the June/July peak of ~300. Pipeline distortion remains at 1080 lost units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is in a post-summer cooling phase. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P25-P31) is approximately 157 units/week, significantly lower than the June/July peak of ~300. Current on-hand inventory is 498 units, which covers more than 3 weeks of the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' count of 1130 units is still heavily distorted by 1080 units from historical lost or critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). Because these 1080 units are essentially ghost inventory and are treated as part of the pipeline by the OR backend, and because on-hand inventory is still sufficient to cover short-term demand, I will continue to hold ordering (allowing depletion). mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the cooled autumn demand level (~157/week). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to capture current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time average, though the high on-hand stock makes lead-time sensitivity low this period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P25-P31) confirmed stable at ~157 units/week, a ~48% decrease from the summer peak.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has clearly entered an autumn cooling phase. The average demand over the last four periods (P29-P32) is approximately 122 units/week, a significant drop from the summer peak of ~300 and the late-summer average of ~175. Currently, on-hand inventory is 415 units. With current weekly demand averaging ~122, this on-hand stock covers more than 3 weeks of demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1130 units is heavily distorted by 1080 units from lost or critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17), meaning the true pipeline is effectively only 50 units (ordered P19). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the cooling demand regime, I will continue to allow on-hand inventory to deplete toward a safer baseline before placing new orders. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the most recent demand cooling, and L to explicit 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering against the 'ghost' pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand cooling confirmed: Period 29-32 average demand is ~122 units/week, down from the late-summer average of ~175.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 34 (2019/09/30). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has transitioned into an autumn regime. The average demand for the last five periods (P29-P33) is approximately 121 units/week. This Cooling trend follows the summer peak (~300 units) and the late-summer transition (~170 units). On-hand inventory is currently 298 units, which covers roughly 2.5 periods of the current demand level. The 'In-transit' count of 1130 units remains heavily distorted by 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17 totaling 1080 units). Consequently, the actual functioning pipeline is only 50 units (the P19 order). Total usable inventory (On-hand + Adjusted Pipeline) is 348 units. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the current period (T=1), we need to cover demand for 3 periods (~363 units). Since 348 is very close to 363, and there is significant holding cost ($1.0), I will target a conservative base stock level to allow the remaining on-hand inventory to cycle before placing significant new orders in the face of supply chain instability. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent autumn demand regime (avg ~121, std ~35).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has entered a distinct autumn cooling phase. Over the last four periods (P31-P34), demand has averaged approximately 94 units/week (109, 83, 117, 68), significantly down from the early autumn average of ~165. On-hand inventory is currently 230 units, which is sufficient to cover over two weeks of the current demand regime. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1130 units is highly distorted by historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17 totaling 1080 units). To ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order soon (as on-hand is approaching safety levels for a 2-period lead time), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to 300 (roughly (1+L)*94 with L=2) to target a base stock level that accounts for the 1080 'ghost' units in the pipeline. This overrides the OR logic that would otherwise see 230 on-hand + 1130 in-transit and order nothing. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed variability in lead times (ranging from 1 to 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand cooling intensified: P31-P34 average demand dropped to ~94 units/week, down from the previous regime of ~160.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is continuing its autumn cooling trend. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has dropped to approximately 85 units per week, significantly lower than the late-summer regime. Furthermore, the pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by 1080 units from lost or critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17), which are all more than 15 periods past their promised arrival dates. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (~85 units/week over L+1 periods) while ignoring the distorted pipeline. With current on-hand inventory at 181 units and demand at ~50-85 units, we have about 2-3 weeks of coverage. An explicit mu_hat of 255 (3 * 85) ensures the base stock calculation target is sensitive to current demand without being suppressed by the lost in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P31-P35) has further cooled to an average of ~85 units/week, down from the mid-autumn average of ~160. Supply chain distortion of 1080 units remains a persistent factor.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has continued its sharp decline as we enter late October. The recent 5-period average (P32-P36) is approximately 70 units/week, with the most recent observation dropping to 31 units. This aligns with a seasonal transition away from lightweight jersey basics for the autumn/winter season. Current on-hand inventory is 240 units, which covers over three weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory remains heavily distorted by 1080 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17 that never arrived). I will continue to set mu_hat explicitly to account for this distortion; if I used default or recent_N methods, the OR backend would see the 1130 in-transit units and refuse to order. However, given the high on-hand stock and rapidly cooling demand, no new orders are necessary this period. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5-period regime (Avg: 70, Std Dev: ~33) to maintain a lean inventory profile.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand cooling confirmed: P32-P36 average demand has dropped to ~70 units/week, a significant decrease from the mid-autumn average of ~160.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has entered a significant cooling phase as we approach the end of October (Autumn/Winter transition). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 63 units/week, down from the mid-autumn average of ~160 and the summer peak of ~300. Current on-hand inventory is 191 units, which covers about 3 weeks of the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' count of 1130 units remains heavily distorted by historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17 totaling 1080 units). However, because on-hand inventory (191) is already sufficient given the current low demand (63/week) and the OR engine uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline inventory, the OR backend would naturally produce a zero-order recommendation. Given the current inventory buffer and the cooling demand, no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent low-demand regime and use default for L as recent arrivals (P35) have been within the promised window.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' continues to decline as we enter November, reflecting the end of the autumn season. Recent demand from Period 35 to Period 38 (49, 31, 49, 27) shows a consistent cooling trend with an average of approximately 39 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 164 units, which is sufficient to cover about 4 periods of demand at this current rate. The in-transit inventory remains significantly distorted by 1080 units from lost or critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17), which have not arrived for several months. Additionally, an order of 50 units from Period 19 is over 19 periods old and also lost. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the decreasing demand, the priority remains to deplete the existing 164 units of on-hand inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to accurately reflect the current low-demand regime. The OR backend will see the distorted in-transit total (1130) and on-hand (164) and correctly calculate that no new orders are needed (order = 0), which is the desired outcome for this phase of the product lifecycle.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand cooling confirmed: P35-P38 average demand has dropped to ~39 units/week, down from the early autumn average of ~70 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has reached a winter trough, with recent demand (P35-P39) averaging approximately 36 units/week. On-hand inventory is 138 units, which covers nearly 4 weeks of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 1130 units includes 1080 units from historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) that are now months overdue and must be considered lost. Since the OR backend uses pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly see a massive surplus and never place a new order. To fix this, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target base stock that forces an order. Based on the current demand of ~36 units/week and a lead time of 2, a safe base stock (L+1) would be ~108 plus safety stock. However, simply setting a low mu_hat won't work while the 1080 'ghost' units exist in the pipeline calculation. I will set L to 'calculate' (the backend's view of avg lead time) and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at 'recent_N' (N=5 for the winter regime) to maintain low inventory until the on-hand stock is depleted further. No order is needed this period as 138 units are sufficient for the immediate lead time plus review period.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: Period 35-39 average demand is 36 units/week. On-hand inventory of 138 units is sufficient for ~4 weeks at current demand levels.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has reached a winter trough, with the last five periods (P36-P40) averaging approximately 32 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 113 units, which covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at this rate. The pipeline of 1130 units is heavily distorted by 1080 units from historical lost/critically delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which are all over 20 periods overdue. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR engine from ordering. However, given the current on-hand stock and the low seasonal demand, no additional orders are necessary for Period 41. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current winter demand regime (N=6 for recent stability) and keep L at default to allow the natural depletion of existing stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the winter trough for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts. Demand has significantly cooled, with the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging only ~28 units/week. On-hand inventory is 101 units, which covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at this rate. The 'In-transit' count of 1130 units remains heavily distorted by historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17 total 1080 units and are many months overdue). Excluding these ghosts, the true pipeline is 50 units (1130 - 1080). However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) and sufficient on-hand stock for the current low-demand regime, no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat to a low 'explicit' value to ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order despite the pipeline distortion, effectively managing the depletion of current on-hand stock during this seasonal low.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: Period 37-41 average demand has dropped to 28 units/week, down from the early autumn average of ~70 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has reached its seasonal winter trough, with recent demand (P37-P42) averaging approximately 34 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 37 units, which roughly covers one week of demand. The 'In-transit' count of 1130 units remains heavily distorted by historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17 totaling 1080 units). The OR backend's order logic is still paralyzed by these 'ghost' units. To ensure availability for the next reflection period (L+1 = 3 weeks), I need a base stock of approximately 100-110 units (3 weeks * 34 units/week + safety stock). However, the system sees 1130 units in the pipeline and will order 0 unless the base stock exceeds that pipeline. Since I cannot clear the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a small replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to 1250 (calculated as pipeline 1130 + goal on-hand 120) will bypass the distortion and trigger a target order of roughly 80-90 units, replenishing the depleted stock for the final periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts is in a winter trough, though there was a slight uptick in early December (Periods 42-43 avg: 63.5 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system shows 1213 units in-transit, but 1080 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, and 17) are long-overdue and confirmed as lost/critically delayed, meaning real pipeline inventory is effectively the Period 43 order (83 units) plus any very recent shipments. To prevent the OR backend from seeing '1213' in pipeline and placing zero orders while we are stocked out, I am using an explicit mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the distorted pipeline. Based on the most recent 2 periods of stable demand (avg 63.5), and assuming a lead time of 2, the required inventory to cover the review and lead time (L+1 = 3 periods) is approximately 190-200 units. By setting mu_hat to 1300, I force the OR backend to 'see' a need that offsets the 1080 ghost units in the pipeline, triggering a small replenishment order to meet the current winter demand level.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has notably increased in early December (P42: 64, P43: 63) compared to the November trough (avg ~25), likely due to holiday shopping or early preparation for the next season. While P44 shows a low demand of 12, the average over the last 3 periods is ~46 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory of 1300 includes 1080 units from much earlier in the year (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which are confirmed as lost or critically delayed. Excluding these 'ghost' units, the true pipeline consists of orders from P43 (83 units) and P44 (87 units), totaling 170 units. Since the OR backend uses the full 1300 units in its logic, it will erroneously see a massive surplus and order 0. To ensure the system orders enough to meet the rising demand while we have 0 on-hand, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. With a 3-week lead time coverage requirement (L=2 promised + current period) and an estimated demand of ~50 units/week, a mu_hat of 150 is appropriate to force replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand uptick: Early December (P42-P43) demand rose to ~63 units/week from the Nov avg of ~25. Cumulative lost/critically delayed shipments remain at 1080 units, distorting pipeline calculations.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, heading into the Christmas/New Year period. Recent demand has been quite volatile (P42: 64, P43: 63, P44: 12, P45: 7), likely reflecting the tail end of a small holiday uptick followed by a pre-holiday lull for this specific T-shirt SKU. On-hand inventory is 76 units. The pipeline (1217 units) remains heavily distorted by 1080 units from 2018 (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which are long-confirmed as lost. Effectively, the real pipeline is only the 137 units ordered in P44 and P46. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1217 in transit and ordering zero, I will continue to use an explicit mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 135 units, which covers 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at an estimated demand of 45 units/week (blending the recent surge with the current lull). Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the high coefficient of variation observed in the last 4 weeks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 falls on Dec 30, following the Christmas/holiday peak. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has hit a seasonal trough in late December (P45-P46 demands were 7 and 6 units). The current on-hand inventory of 70 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next several weeks at this rate. The in-transit inventory of 1217 units continues to be heavily distorted by 1080 units from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) and more recently, the P44 order (87 units) which is still within the promised lead time. Given the extremely low demand and current stock, no new order is required. Setting L=2 (promised) and using N=4 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the post-holiday cooling trend (P43-P46 average demand ~22 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand trough established in late December: P45-P46 weekly demand dropped to <10 units.
