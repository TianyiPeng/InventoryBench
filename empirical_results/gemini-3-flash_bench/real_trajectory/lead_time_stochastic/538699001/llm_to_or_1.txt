Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for a Women's V-neck strap top (Everyday Basic). Inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. Promised Lead Time (L) is 2. The sample demand shows a clear upward trend from late January into February (98, 95, 128, 120, 190). The most recent sample (190) is significantly higher than the previous mean (~110), likely indicating a seasonal shift as 'Everyday Basics' ramp up for spring/summer, or responding to specific retail cycles. To avoid stockouts with a 2-period lead time, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand, which captures the leap from ~100 to ~150 mean. For lead time, I will assume 'default' (2) until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck top. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 98, 95, 128, 120, 190, and most recently 292 in Period 1. This suggests a strong seasonal ramp-up as we move toward spring. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 210 in-transit from Period 1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in Period 4). We currently have an inventory deficit against high demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the accelerating trend (avg of 190, 292, plus the projected growth) and use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure we cover the (L+1) period demand which is roughly 250-300 per week. For L, I will stay with 'default' (2) as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck top. Historical demand shows a significant increase in the last three weeks (292, 265, and pre-observation samples increasing from ~95 to 190). The average demand over the last four observable points (Feb 4 to Feb 18) is (190+292+265)/3 = 249 per week. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The orders from Period 1 and 2 (totaling 636 units) are in-transit and haven't arrived yet; given the 2-period lead time, the P1 order (210 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P3). With demand significantly higher than the initial samples, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new level (~249 units/week) and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect recent volatility. The base stock will aim to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 4: Mean weekly demand increased from ~110 to ~250 (+127%) coinciding with the transition into early Spring seasonal stocking.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019/3/4). The item is a 'V-neck strap top', a seasonal basic. Analysis of demand shows a significant regime shift starting Feb 4. Pre-Feb 4 mean demand was ~110 (5 samples). Post-Feb 4 demand (Period 1-3) has jumped to a mean of 250.3 (292, 265, 194). Despite the lower demand in Period 3 (194), the spring trend is established. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution and be visible now, but 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. On-hand is currently 0 with 747 units in-transit. I will set L to 3 manually to account for the observed delay and use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the new seasonal level while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting L=3 and using the higher recent mean will increase the base stock calculation to cover the extended lead time and protect against stockouts once shipments finally land.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay observed: Period 1 order (L=2) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude, suggesting actual lead time is at least 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. The SKU is a 'V-neck strap top', a typical Spring/Summer basic. History shows a demand shift from ~110 (pre-Feb) to an average of 229.75 over the last 4 periods (292, 265, 194, 168). While demand has softened slightly in the last two weeks, it remains higher than the initial January samples. In Period 4, we received the order from Period 2 (arrived=426, LT=2), but the order from Period 1 (210 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in Period 3). This suggests the Period 1 shipment is likely lost. I will assume an explicit lead time of 2 (matching the most recent successful delivery) but set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period mean (~230/week). For L=2, mu_hat = (1+L)*230 = 690. Given the high pipeline (576 units) and current inventory (258), the OR backend will calculate base_stock and order accordingly to maintain the service level while accounting for the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment loss confirmed for Period 1 order (210 units) as it is 2 periods past promised/actual lead time with no 'conclude' message. Demand stabilized at a higher mean of ~230 units/week since Feb 11.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/03/18), the SKU (Women's V-neck strap top) is entering the mid-Spring season. Historical demand samples (before simulation) were low (95-190), but the simulation history shows a higher mean. Since Feb 11 (Period 1), demand has been 292, 265, 194, 168, and 150. There is a downward trend from the initial spike, stabilizing around a mean of 214 over the last 5 periods. Lead time analysis: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (as promised), but Period 1 order (210 units) is now definitively lost as it hasn't arrived by Period 5 conclude (3 periods late). Current inventory: 108 on-hand + 576 in-transit (Orders from P3, P4). Total pipeline is 684. With a mean demand of ~214 and a lead time of 2, the 'coverage' needed is (L+1) * mean = 642. The OR backend's capped policy will likely order 0 this period as pipeline (684) > base_stock targets. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent mean of 214 and sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility to ensure the safety stock is appropriately sized for the 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has stabilized at ~214 units/week over the last 5 periods, moving away from the initial Feb spike. Lead time for successful deliveries remains 2 periods, but one failure (P1 lost) is confirmed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU is a 'V-neck strap top', a typical Spring/Summer basic. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 6 (demand was 233, but only 108 units were available). Total in-transit is 576 units (ordered in Periods 3 and 4). The Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). The Period 1 order is confirmed lost. Since the stockout occurred, demand has remained significant (averaging ~217 units over the last 6 periods). Given the current on-hand of 0 and the expected arrival of Period 3's order (111 units) in Period 7 arrival resolution, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the stockout deficit and maintain service levels for the upcoming periods. I am setting L=2 (default), mu_hat for the (L+1) horizon based on the recent stable demand of ~217 units/week, and sigma_hat based on the variance of these recent periods to account for the volatility seen in February and March.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (women's V-neck strap top) is entering the peak Spring/Summer season. Historical demand since the Feb 4th regime shift has averaged ~221 units (292, 265, 194, 168, 150, 233, 248). While there was a slight dip in late Feb/early March, the last two weeks (233, 248) indicate a return to a high-demand regime, likely driven by warmer weather transitions. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to an stockout in Period 6 and 7. The Period 1 order (210 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 2 order (426 units) arrived in Period 4 (L=2). The Period 3 order (111 units) was placed in Period 3 and is now 5 periods old without arriving, suggesting it is likely lost as well. The Period 4 order (255 units) should arrive during Period 6 or 7, but was not visible in 'conclude' yet, or might arrive now. To ensure service levels for this seasonal item, I will set L to 2 (default), and use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the Spring regime (Avg ~221). Since current on-hand is 0 and we have lost shipments, I need mu_hat to be robust. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Shipment loss of Period 3 order (111 units) is suspected as it is 3 periods past promised lead time. Demand remains in high-regime Spring state (avg ~220-230 units).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (V-neck strap top) is entering peak Spring/Summer seasonality. On-hand inventory is 0 after exhausting the 75 units that arrived last period (a lead time of 1 period for the Period 7 order). There are 590 units in-transit, but we must account for likely lost shipments: Period 1 (210 units) is confirmed lost, and Period 3 (111 units) is now 4 periods past its order date with no arrival, making it highly likely lost. The remaining valid pipeline is likely orders from Periods 4 and 8. Demand has surged to 313 in Period 8, confirming an upward seasonal trend. We use recent_N=5 to capture the high-demand regime (avg ~212, but trending higher). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the 1-period and 2-period arrivals seen so far, and use explicit mu_hat to ensure we cover the rising demand + potential lead time (L+1=3). mu_hat is set to 750 (approx 250 units/week * 3 periods) to ensure a robust base stock that overcomes pipeline gaps.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 3 order (111 units) is confirmed lost (5 periods since order, promised L=2). Seasonal demand spike observed in April (P8 demand = 313), suggesting a new peak regime for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/04/15 (Period 10). The product is a 'V-neck strap top' (Everyday Basics), which is currently seeing a seasonal demand spike as we enter the Spring/Summer peak. Demand in Period 8 was 313, and Period 9 was 240, indicating a higher mean regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 217 units/week. Since profit is $1 and holding cost is $1, the critical ratio is 0.5, implying we should target the median demand (z=0) to minimize total cost. Supply chain reliability is a major concern: Period 1 and Period 3 orders were lost. Period 2 arrived on time (L=2) and Period 7 arrived early (L=1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent orders for P8 (14) and P9 (160) are in-transit. To ensure we capture this seasonal peak while accounting for the ~20-30% shipment loss risk observed so far, I will set L to 'default' (2) but use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the Spring regime) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (Std Dev of the last 5 periods is approx 60, and sqrt(1+L)*60 \u2248 104).

Carry-over insight: April seasonal peak confirmed: Demand mean for V-neck strap tops has increased to ~220-250 units/week. Reliability warning: 2 out of 7 historical orders (P1, P3) have been lost, suggesting a ~28% risk of shipment failure.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late April, a high-demand period for 'Womens Everyday Basics' V-neck tops. Demand in the most recent regime (Periods 8-10) has averaged 251.6 units (313, 240, 202). On-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 576 units (likely from orders placed in P4 and P10, as P1 and P3 are confirmed lost). Historical lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 2 periods, with multiple lost shipments. To manage this high risk and prevent stockouts during the seasonal peak, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to capture the April surge (~252/week), and using the promised L=2 to calculate the base stock requirements. sigma_hat is also set to reflect recent volatility. This conservative approach aims to replenish stock quickly to meet the sustained high demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29), we are in a high-demand Spring/Early-Summer regime for the V-neck strap top. Historical demand in the last 4 periods has averaged ~182.5 units (313, 240, 202, 175), though earlier April figures exceeded 220. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 755 units in transit (including 179 from P11 and 576 from P12's automated logic). Reliability is a major concern: orders from P1 and P3 were lost, and we currently have zero stock to satisfy demand. Given that the promised lead time is 2, and recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P7 took 1, P8 took 2, P9 took 1), I will use an explicit L of 2 to ensure coverage for the review period plus lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current plateau of demand (avg ~182), and sigma_hat is set to explicit (60) to account for the high volatility seen in April (peak 313 vs trough 175) and to mitigate the impact of historically frequent lost shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are managing a 'V-neck strap top', a summer-season basic. There is currently 0 on-hand inventory and 755 units in-transit. Historically, we've seen significant shipment reliability issues (Period 1 and Period 3 orders were lost). Demand has stabilized in a high-regime Spring/Summer state; the average demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 228 units per week (313, 240, 202, 175, 211). The promised lead time is 2, and while recent arrivals (P10) showed lead times of 1-2 periods, the stockouts are primarily driven by lost shipments and high demand volatility. I will set L to 'default' (2) but use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current seasonal average of ~228. This results in a mu_hat covering current + 2 future periods (1+2=3 periods) of roughly 684 units. Given the pipeline is 755 units, the OR engine will likely moderate ordering this period while waiting for the P11 order (179 units) and other recent orders to arrive, balancing the high holding cost (equal to profit) against stockout risks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-regime demand confirmed for Spring/Summer season (P8-P12): Mean demand is ~228 units/week. Shipment reliability remains a core risk with two confirmed lost orders (P1, P3).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13, 2019), the SKU (V-neck strap top) is in the middle of its Spring/Summer peak season. Historically, demand has averaged ~228 units/week since early April. Period 13 concluded with 13 units on-hand after satisfying 166 demand (of 166 units). There are 576 units in-transit (orders from Period 12, potentially Period 13, and currently). A notable risk is shipment reliability (2 out of 9 historical orders lost: P1 and P3). The lead time for delivered orders is consistently 2 periods (except for two 1-period instances). Mean demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N=6 (covering Periods 8-13) to capture the current seasonal regime which averages ~214 units/week. Since profit=holding_cost=$1, the critical ratio q=0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I'm using L=2 (default) but inflating sigma_hat to account for the ~22% historical shipment loss rate, ensuring the base stock level is robust against supply disruptions while demand remains relatively stable.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), we are firmly in the Spring/Summer demand regime for V-neck strap tops. Recent demand (P9-P14) has averaged approximately 195 units/week (240, 202, 175, 211, 166, 177). While slightly lower than the April peak (313), it remains significant. A major concern is the ongoing stockout situation (on-hand is 0) despite 641 units being 'In-transit'. However, historical data shows P1 and P3 orders were lost, and we are currently waiting for orders from Periods 14 (65 units) and unspecified previous periods to arrive. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR engine's service level target is 50%. I will set \u03bc\u0302 based on the most recent 7 periods (P8-P14) where demand has hovered near 210 units to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers (L+1) demand. I'll maintain L=default since the backend prometed 2 periods usually holds, though shipment reliability (loss) remains the primary risk.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the 'V-neck strap top' remains in a stable Spring/Summer demand regime. Analyzing demand from Period 8 to Period 15 (8 samples), the mean demand is approximately 212 units per week. The ending inventory for Period 15 is 0, and there are 641 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent orders from Period 14 (65 units) and likely any unfulfilled logic from the OR backend in previous periods. Since the promised lead time is 2, the Period 14 order should arrive during Period 16, but inventory is currently 0. Given the history of lost shipments (P1, P3), there is a significant risk that pipeline inventory is inflated by phantom 'lost' orders not yet cleared. However, looking at the recent history, shipments from P7, P8, P9, and P11 arrived successfully with lead times of 1 or 2. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the recent 8-period window (N=8) to capture the stabilized seasonal mean (~212 units) rather than the volatile early Feb spike. I will keep the lead time at 'default' (promised L=2) as recent successful arrivals have adhered to L=1 or L=2. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~636 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Mean demand for the Spring/Summer period (P8-P15) has stabilized at ~212 units/week, down slightly from the April peak of ~230.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), we are in the peak summer season for the 'V-neck strap top'. Historical demand from Period 8 to Period 16 shows a stable but high-volume regime with a mean of approximately 213 units per week (min 150, max 313). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 641, but we have a history of significant shipment loss (Period 1 and Period 3 orders were never delivered). Specifically, the order from Period 14 (65 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting a possible delay or loss. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time varies between 1 and 2. Given the critical stockout situation and the high demand regime, I will set L to 'default' (2) to align with promised expectations, but use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the sustained high demand since April (P8-P16). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the volatility seen in this seasonal peak. This strategy aims to rebuild inventory to meet the ~213 units/week demand while the backend OR logic balances the 1:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), the SKU 538699001 (V-neck strap top) is in the middle of its Spring/Summer peak season. Current on-hand inventory is 0, with 641 units in transit (likely encompassing orders from Periods 14 and earlier that are significantly delayed or lost). Historical analysis shows a high risk of lost shipments (Orders from P1 and P3 were confirmed lost; P14 is now 3 periods overdue). Demand has been stable since the April peak (Period 8). I will define a demand regime using the last 10 samples (P8-P17) to capture the current seasonal mean (avg ~212 units/period). Given the unreliability of arrivals and current zero on-hand status, I choose an explicit mu_hat covering (L+1) = 3 periods based on this 212 mean (~636 units) and set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average valid historical lead times (typically 1-2 periods). sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent 10-period volatility to ensure the base stock is robust against existing demand variance.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17, moving towards mid-summer. The product is a 'V-neck strap top', which is a quintessential summer item. Since Period 14, no orders have been placed (ordered=0), leading to stockouts from Period 15-18 as reflected by sold=0 and on-hand=0. Demand has recently softened from ~212 units (Spring/Summer avg) to 125 units in Period 18, though this may be a fluctuations. The In-transit balance of 641 units is problematic: it likely includes the 65 units ordered in Period 14 (now 4 periods old, likely lost) and various historical lost orders (Period 1, 3). However, to trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, I must acknowledge the stockout. I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (Spring/Summer regime) and keep lead time at the promised 2 periods to ensure a robust base stock calculation. The high pipeline count (641) from 'lost' orders might prevent ordering, so I am setting mu_hat explicitly high to force the system to see the need for units despite the phantom inventory, aiming to cover at least 3 weeks of demand (~600 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand appears to be softening slightly in June (P18 demand 125), but the 10-period average remains ~190-200. Shipment from Period 14 (65 units) is now 4 periods old and likely lost, joining P1 and P3 in the 'lost' category.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for the V-neck strap top has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the April peak. Moving from June into July, historical samples suggest demand remains steady or slightly declines. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 189 units/week, down from the Spring/Summer peak of ~228. Inventory position is highly precarious: on-hand is 0, and while 'in-transit' shows 641 units, we have high evidence of shipment loss. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, and now P14 (65 units, 6 periods old) are confirmed or highly likely lost. The backend base-stock calculation includes all in-transit units, which creates a significant risk of under-ordering if those lost units are never cleared. Since I cannot manually subtract lost units from the pipeline, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current demand level (~189/week) and use 'default' lead time (2) as recent arrivals (P2, P7, P8, P9, P11) show actual lead times of 1-2 periods. I am setting the backend to react to the modern demand regime while acknowledging the supply reliability issues.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Shipment from Period 14 (65 units) is confirmed lost (ordered P14, current P20, promised L=2). Cumulative shipment reliability for this SKU is poor, with 3 of 10 significant orders lost (P1, P3, P14).

As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in the peak Summer season for the 'V-neck strap top'. Demand has recently shown some volatility but remains relatively high, with a mean demand of approximately 187 units over the last 10 periods (P11-P20). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 641 units is problematic because it includes historical orders from P1, P3, and P14 which were confirmed lost (totaling 386 units). Realistically, only 255 units (from the order in P4, which never arrived? No, P4 arrived. Wait, history shows P1, P3, P14 orders totaling 210, 111, 65 = 386 are lost). The remaining pipeline inventory calculation by the OR backend will be inflated by these 'ghost' units, leading to under-ordering. To compensate for the 386 phantom units and ensure we cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Mean demand is ~190; for 3 periods, that is 570. However, because the backend subtracts the full 641 'In-transit' from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that fills the actual inventory gap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the current Summer regime (~187 * 3 = 561) and 'default' for L and sigma_hat, but the primary concern is the pipeline inflation.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 22 (July 8, 2019). The SKU 538699001 (V-neck strap top) is a seasonal summer item ('Womens Everyday Basics'). Demand since June (Period 17 onwards) shows a cooling trend: 181, 125, 204, 158, 79. This suggests a seasonal peak trailing off as we move through July. The 5-period average is now ~149 units/week, significantly lower than the Spring peak of ~228. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and the in-transit amount is 641 units. Reviewing the pipeline: Orders from P1 (210), P3 (111), and P14 (65) are confirmed lost (Total = 386). This means the 'true' pipeline is 641 - 386 = 255 units (from P2, though P2 is extremely old and likely lost too, it remains in the system count until the conclude message system allows closure). However, the logic for the backend OR engine needs us to provide mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the *current* demand level. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the cooling demand phase (avg ~149) rather than the historical high mean, which prevents over-ordering during the seasonal decline. Lead time parameter remains 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P11, P9, P8) averaged 1.66 periods, close to the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand has decreased to ~149 units/week over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) as the peak Summer season begins to transition. Shipment reliability remains poor with 3 verified losses (P1, P3, P14).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of July 15 (Period 23), the V-neck strap top (Womens Everyday Basics) is exhibiting a clear seasonal decline. Demand has decreased from a Spring peak of ~230 to a current 5-period average (P18-P22) of 124 units. The most recent demand (P21: 79, P22: 55) confirms this downward trend as we move into Late Summer. Inventory management remains complicated by reliability; three historical orders (P1, P3, P14) were lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but in-transit inventory is high (641 units), likely consisting of orders placed in recent periods not yet concluded or potentially overdue. Given Profit=HoldingCost ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (current mean ~124) correctly reflects the end-of-season softening, preventing over-ordering. I use L = recent_N=5 for lead-time to base the inventory target on the most recent observed arrival behaviors (while acknowledging the 2-period promise), and mu_hat/sigma_hat on the last 5 samples to capture the immediate demand drop.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand softening confirmed: Weekly demand has dropped significantly in July, with the most recent two periods (P21-P22) averaging 67 units/week compared to the early summer average of ~150.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 24 (late July). The demand for 'V-neck strap tops' (a summer staple) has clearly entered a late-season decline. The mean demand for the last three periods (P21-P23) is 56.3 units/week, down significantly from the spring/summer peak of ~220. My current on-hand inventory is 0, but I have a substantial 641 units in-transit. Given that several historical orders (P1, P3, P14) were lost, the reliability of the pipeline is a concern; however, 641 units is nearly 10x the current weekly demand. Ordering more now would likely result in excessive holding costs as we move further away from the summer peak. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this sharp downward regime shift and set L to 'calculate' to account for recent arrival timings, while the pipeline inventory (even adjusted for potential losses) will prevent the backend from over-ordering during this tapering demand phase.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand decline confirmed: Late July demand (P21-P23) has dropped to a mean of ~56 units/week, representing a ~73% decrease from the early summer average (~212).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. The SKU (V-neck strap top) is experiencing a clear end-of-season demand collapse. Demand has dropped from a Spring/Summer average of ~212 units/week to a very low level over the last four periods: P21 (79), P22 (55), P23 (35), and P24 (23). The mean of the last 4 periods is ~48 units/week. Additionally, the store currently has 0 on-hand inventory but 641 units in-transit. Given the plummeting demand and the massive incoming pipeline (which is more than 10x the current weekly demand), no further orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering more, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the sharp downward trend. While the backend's base-stock calculation might still suggest an order, the pipeline inventory of 641 units will significantly exceed any calculated base-stock level, resulting in a zero order (capped policy). Reliability remains poor (30% loss rate), but with 641 units in the pipeline for a product selling <30 units/week, even massive losses will not cause a stockout.

Carry-over insight: Seasonality update: August transition confirmed. Demand has reached a localized floor of <30 units/week, representing a >85% decline from peak April/May levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (early August). Historically, this SKU (V-neck strap top) is highly seasonal. The data shows a dramatic decline in demand from over 200 units/week in May/June to just 17 units in the most recent period (P25), confirming the end of the summer season. On-hand inventory is 0, but there is a significant 'In-transit' quantity of 641 units. Although the game history shows several likely lost shipments (P1, P3, P14), the 641 units in-transit are likely a result of recent large orders placed manually or by previous controllers that haven't arrived yet. Given the current demand floor of 17-23 units, even if most of the 641 units are lost or delayed, any arrivals will likely exceed the current low demand, leading to high holding costs if more is ordered. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (the current low-demand regime) to prevent the OR backend from placing more orders while we wait for the pipeline to clear or the demand to recover (unlikely in late August). I will use default for L and sigma_hat as the primary objective is to stop new ordering until the existing pipeline is reconciled.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'V-neck strap top', a summer-seasonal item. Demand has entered a clear end-of-season decline, dropping from peak levels (~200+) to a consistent low range of 17\u201335 units over the last 5 periods (P22\u2013P26). The mean demand over the last 3 samples is 22.3 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 641 units in-transit. These in-transit units include large orders from Periods 2, 4 (255 units), and potentially others that the OR engine logic is tracking. Even though P1, P3, and P14 are identified as lost in the carry-over insights, the remaining pipeline (specifically the 255 units from P4 and subsequent residuals) is significantly larger than any projected demand for the remainder of the season. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend service level target (q) is 50%, favoring lean inventory. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand floor (approx 23 units/week) and use recent_N=3 to capture the most current stabilization in August. Lead time remains default (2).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (late August), the demand for this SKU (Jersey V-neck strap top) has firmly entered a low-volume end-of-season state. Demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) has averaged ~26 units/week, a massive drop from the Spring/Summer peak of ~230 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0, but there is a massive in-transit balance of 641 units. This in-transit likely consists of the original Period 4 (255 units) and Period 14 (65 units) orders which are confirmed lost, plus others that are significantly overdue. However, even if only a fraction of these units arrive, they will far exceed the current low demand. Given that holding cost ($1.0) equals profit ($1.0), the critical priority is to avoid any new orders that would incur holding costs on stagnant end-of-season stock. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect historical variability and use a 'recent_N' of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand floor (~26 units/week). This will result in a base stock level that is likely lower than the current (mostly lost) in-transit, preventing the OR backend from placing any new orders while we wait for any remaining viable shipments or the season to fully conclude.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Late-summer demand floor confirmed. Mean demand for the last 5 periods has stabilized at ~26 units/week, confirming the end of the high-demand Spring/Summer cycle.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey tops has reached a seasonal minimum, averaging ~26 units/week over the last five periods (P24-P28: 23, 17, 27, 28, 18). This aligns with the end of the Spring/Summer fashion cycle. The on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 641 units 'in-transit'. Most of these in-transit units are from orders placed early in the game (P4: 255, P2: 426 which arrived, but P1: 210, P3: 111, P14: 65 are confirmed lost). Accounting for the confirmed losses of P1, P3, and P14 (total 386 units), the effective pipeline is significantly lower (approx 255 units remaining, likely from more recent un-concluded orders if any, though the history shows no orders since P14). Since demand is currently very low (~25 units) and the backend cap will prevent over-ordering, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand floor and default settings for lead time as there are no recent arrivals to calculate a shift. The high in-transit count relative to demand will likely result in a zero order from the OR backend.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Demand for the 'V-neck strap top' has stabilized at a late-summer floor, with the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) at approximately 22.8 units/week. This SKU has a significant history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P14), and although there are 641 units currently marked as 'In-transit', these are largely ghost units from failed deliveries earlier in the year that have not been cleared from the pipeline inventory by the backend. Specifically, most of that 641 likely consists of the lost P1, P3, and P14 orders. However, since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is very low, any new order would be small. Given the high inventory holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable low-demand regime. Lead time is set to default (2) as recent successful arrivals (P11, P9, P8) aligned with 1-2 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the 'V-neck strap top' has stabilized at a late-summer floor, with the last 5 periods (P26-P30) averaging 22 units/week. This follows a significant seasonal decline from the Spring/Summer peak (which averaged ~212 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0. There are 641 units 'In-transit', but historical data shows three confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P14). Even if we assume a high loss rate, the current pipeline is extremely high relative to the current demand regime (641 units vs a demand of ~20-30 units/week). No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the stabilized low-demand floor, and use the 'default' lead time of 2. The OR backend will naturally suppress ordering because on-hand + pipeline exceeds the base stock level calculated from these low-demand parameters.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for this SKU (V-neck strap top) is in a deep post-summer trough. The last five periods (P27-P31) have seen an average demand of approximately 18 units/week, with the most recent two periods dropping to 11-13 units. This signifies a localized floor for the fall season. There is an extremely large 'in-transit' volume of 641 units. This total is composed of early-game lost orders (P1: 210, P3: 111, P14: 65, totaling 386 units) and newer pipeline units. Given that on-hand is 0 and the net pipeline (excluding likely lost units) is still roughly 255 units, which covers over 14 weeks of current demand (~18/week), no new orders are necessary. I will set the lead time to the promised 2 periods (as recent successful arrivals confirmed 2) and use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand floor and prevent the OR backend from over-ordering based on the high spring/summer historical mean.

Carry-over insight: September demand floor confirmed: Mean demand has dropped further to ~18 units/week (P27-P31), down from the late-summer floor of ~26. SKU is entering a minimal-volume fall regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '538699001' (V-neck strap top) is in a clear end-of-season, low-demand regime for the Fall. Current date is late September (Period 33). Historically, demand for this item peaked in Spring (April/May) at ~230 units/week and has steadily declined to a floor of ~15 units/week over the last 5-10 periods. Specifically, demand for P28-P32 was 18, 24, 13, 11, 12. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this current floor of 15.6 units/week. While there is a massive 'In-transit' balance of 641 units, history shows a significant pattern of lost shipments (P1, P3, P14). However, even if those are lost, the 641 units in transit (likely from older un-concluded orders or system carry-over) far exceed the required base stock for a demand of 15 units/week. Therefore, I will set parameters to reflect the low demand regime and allow 'In-transit' to cover any needs, effectively preventing new orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The SKU (V-neck strap top) is in a minimal-volume fall demand regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) has averaged 13.8 units/week, consistent with the identified September demand floor. I am maintaining a base stock level that reflects this lower demand environment to avoid excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are 641 units in-transit (though a significant portion of this in-transit inventory originates from much earlier periods and likely contains lost shipments, the OR backend's capped policy will manage the order flow). I am using recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the current floor while being sensitive to the low volumes. Lead time is set to default (promised L=2) as recent successful deliveries were within 1-2 periods, despite the historical risk of lost orders.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019 (Period 35). The demand for this V-neck strap top (a Summer/Spring staple) has reached a minimal fall floor. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged 10.8 units per week (13, 11, 12, 9, 9). The inventory position shows 0 on-hand and 641 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent historical orders (specifically Period 1, 3, 4, and 14) that were previously flagged as likely lost but technically remained in the 'pipeline inventory' in the backend system. Because pipeline inventory (641) far exceeds any reasonable base stock level for the current low-demand regime (approx. 11 units/week), the OR backend will not place new orders unless specifically overridden. Given the product's extreme seasonality and the current entry into the fall/winter season, the objective is to maintain zero or minimal inventory to avoid holding costs on a low-demand SKU. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current floor of ~11 units per week, ensuring the OR backend sees the low demand. No new orders are needed and none will be generated given the massive (though likely lost) in-transit balance.

Carry-over insight: October demand floor confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~10-11 units per week (P30-P34). Pipeline inventory of 641 units consists entirely of orders from P1, P3, P4, and P14 which are long-confirmed lost, but still block automated ordering due to the backend's accounting of 'in-transit' units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '538699001' (V-neck strap top) is in a deep late-cycle demand floor as of mid-October, with demand averaging approximately 10 units per week over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). A critical issue persists with the 'In-transit' quantity of 641 units, which consists of orders from P1 (210), P3 (111), P4 (255), and P14 (65), all of which are long-confirmed lost. However, the OR backend logic subtracts this phantom pipeline from the base_stock calculation (final order = base_stock - pipeline), effectively preventing any new orders from being placed. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a value high enough so that (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) exceeds the 641 'phantom' units. Based on current demand of ~10 units/week and a promised lead time of 2 (L+1=3), a 'normal' mu_hat would be ~30. To force an order that covers the current demand floor despite the 641-unit blockage, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will target a base stock of 670 units to trigger a small replenishment (approx 29 units) to resume service while minimizing holding cost risk for this low-velocity period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a very low-demand Fall regime, with a mean demand of approximately 9 units/week over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). Pipeline inventory is reported as 660, reflecting the sum of historical lost orders (P1: 210, P3: 111, P14: 65, P4: 255) and the small recent order from P36 (19 units). Since lost orders never 'conclude', they remain in the backend's pipeline inventory indefinitely, blocking the base-stock logic from placing new orders if mu_hat is set too low. To bypass this and ensure we can fulfill the current low demand, I am using the 'explicit' method. For L, I use 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I calculate (1+L) * mean_demand + confirmed_lost_units. Mean demand is ~10, L=2, so (3 * 10) = 30. Adding the 641 confirmed lost units (210+111+65+255) gives 671. This ensures the backend (base_stock - 660) > 0, allowing for a small maintenance order. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value to reflect the current stability of the demand floor.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable low-demand fall regime, with mean demand of approximately 9-11 units per week observed in October. Period 36 and 37 demand was 6 and 10 units respectively. The core operational challenge remains the ghost 'In-transit' inventory of 641 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, and P14), which exceeds the OR backend's calculated base stock, effectively blocking automated replenishments. To force the system to order despite these ghost units, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the 'ghost pipeline' plus the expected demand for the (L+1) window. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 700 units (641 ghost units + approx. 60 units for 3 weeks of fall demand) to bypass this check and ensure small safety stock is maintained. L is set to default (2). Sigma_hat is set to 20 to account for recent demand volatility (6 to 10 units is a 66% relative variance).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-volume Late-Fall regime with weekly demand averaging ~8 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). A critical issue remains the 689 units listed as 'In-transit', which include historical lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P14. These phantom units prevent the OR backend's automated ordering because they inflate 'pipeline inventory'. To circumvent this and ensure availability for the current demand, I must use 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 35 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of current demand (1+L=3), and sigma_hat to 10 to provide a small safety buffer. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate recent successful deliveries like the P37 order which arrived in 1 period.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost pipeline inventory (641+ units from lost P1, P3, P4, P14 orders) continues to block the OR engine's standard logic. Demand has reached a stable late-autumn floor of ~8 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable late-autumn low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 8 units per week over the last 5 periods. The main operational challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 641 units from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, 4, and 14. These lost units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary replenishment orders because it believes the pipeline is overstocked. To circumvent this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. I calculate mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at the current rate of ~8 units/week (total 24). However, to trigger an order despite the 641 ghost units, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the total pipeline plus on-hand inventory. Since the ghost inventory is ~670 and current on-hand is 19, mu_hat must be significantly higher than 689 to generate an order. Given the low demand and 1:1 profit/holding cost ratio, large orders would incur excessive holding costs. In Period 38 and 39, small arrivals (11 and 19 units) based on recent manual-like parameters were observed. I will continue to use explicit parameters to maintain a small but sufficient on-hand buffer (~20-30 units) without triggering massive over-orders.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable low-demand late-autumn regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) has averaged 7.2 units/week. The logistics system continues to show inconsistencies: while recent trials (P36, P37) eventually arrived, the lead times varied (3 periods and 1 period respectively), and a massive 'ghost inventory' of 641 units from lost orders early in the year (P1, P3, P4, P14) remains in the in-transit accounting. This ghost inventory blocks the OR backend's standard replenishment logic because it believes the pipeline is overfilled relative to the low demand. To force any necessary procurement and maintain a safety stock against the current 7-8 unit demand floor, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to 24 (covering 3 periods of demand at ~8 units/period). Sigma_hat is set to 8 to provide a modest safety buffer. This ensures that even with the ghost inventory, the OR backend sees a target base stock that reflects current real-world needs rather than historical seasonal peaks.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime stabilized: mean demand for P36-P40 is 7.2 units/week. Ghost inventory from lost early-season shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14) totaling 641 units remains permanently in-transit, necessitating explicit parameter overrides to bypass automated pipeline logic.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for this V-neck strap top has stabilized in a low-volume late-autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging 7.6 units/week. The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory (approximately 641 units) from four confirmed lost shipments in the first half of the year (P1, P3, P14, and likely P4). Because the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) treats these lost units as incoming, it will block all new orders unless parameters are explicitly manipulated. I will use the 'explicit' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to bypass the phantom inventory. I estimate demand at 8 units/week. For a lead time of 2, the total demand over L+1 periods is 24. To trigger an order that maintains availability despite the 641-unit phantom inventory block, I set mu_hat to 680 (covering the 641 lost units plus 3 periods of expected demand) and provide a moderate sigma_hat to ensure some safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed late-autumn demand stability at ~8 units/week. Ghost pipeline inventory (641 units) continues to necessitate explicit parameter overrides to ensure replenishment.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand for this SKU (V-neck strap top) has stabilized at a very low late-autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P38-P42) averaging 6.4 units/week. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 701 units is heavily inflated by ghost inventory from lost orders in the first half of the year (P1, P3, P4, P14 totaling 641 units). Only the order from P38 (29 units) and P40 (31 units) are likely viable. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 701 units 'in-transit', I must set mu_hat to a value significantly higher than the ghost inventory. Since the real demand is actually ~7 units/week, a target of roughly 25 units total (3-4 weeks of stock) would be ideal, but to trigger the OR engine to order past the 641 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 750. This 'tricks' the backend into seeing a stock requirement greater than the pipeline, while the 'cap' logic in the OR engine (using mu_hat and sigma_hat) will prevent it from ordering an excessive amount.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable late-autumn/winter low-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 7-8 units per week over the last 8 periods (P36-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 27 units, which covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at the current rate. However, a significant 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 719 units exists, primarily composed of lost shipments from earlier in the year (P1, P3, P14 totaling 210+111+65=386 units plus other likely lost units). This ghost inventory prevents the OR engine's automated logic (base stock - pipeline) from placing necessary orders. To ensure continuous availability while avoiding excessive holding costs, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at 8 units/week, totaling 24 units. By setting mu_hat to 743 (719 ghost units + 24 units required), the OR engine will calculate a base stock that accounts for the ghost units and triggers an order to maintain the desired service level. Sigma_hat is set relatively low to reflect the current low-variance demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-19.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable late-autumn/winter demand regime with a mean of approximately 5-6 units per week (P40-P44 demand: 9, 8, 4, 4, 4). The 'ghost' pipeline inventory (719 bits in-transit) significantly exceeds the desired base stock for this low-demand phase. These in-transit units are from long-lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P14) and recent orders already accounted for. To bypass the backend logic that subtracts this ghost inventory from the order quantity, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the ghost inventory + on-hand inventory. The goal is to maintain a small buffer of ~40 units on-hand (approx. 6-8 weeks of stock at current rates). Current on-hand is 23. To trigger a small replenishment order of ~15-20 units, mu_hat must be set to approximately (On-hand 23 + In-transit 719 + desired order 17) = 759. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P38, P39, P43) show variable lead times of 1-3 periods, and the backend average is now more representative.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Demand for this vest top has reached a winter floor, averaging 5.2 units/week over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), with the most recent sample at only 2 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 687 units is primarily comprised of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, 4, and 14 (totaling 641 units). However, recent successful deliveries (P36, P37, P40, P43) confirm that the supply chain is functional with an average lead time of approx 2.25 periods. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 641 lost units as available pipeline and blocking necessary replenishment, I am using explicit overrides. I set mu_hat to 25 to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the current rate plus a small safety buffer, and sigma_hat to 10 to manage low-volume volatility. This ensures a base stock high enough to trigger an order if on-hand (70) drops, while acknowledging that current stock is sufficient for the immediate winter floor.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed (P36-P45): Mean demand has decreased to ~5 units/week. Supply chain remains functional for current orders (P43 arrived in 2 periods), despite significant historical losses (641 units) remaining in-transit indefinitely.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable Winter demand floor, with an average demand of approximately 4-5 units per week over the last 10 periods. The most recent demand (P46) was only 1 unit. On-hand inventory is 69 units, which is ample to cover current demand levels for several months. However, the 'in-transit' inventory of 687 units is primarily comprised of historical lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P14 totaling 641 units) that have never arrived. Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock target, it will never place a new order as long as these 'ghost' units exist in the pipeline. To ensure the system remains capable of ordering if demand spikes (though not expected this week), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit method. I have calculated mu_hat to be 750 (representing the 'ghost' inventory of 641 plus coverage for demand) to force the backend to consider placing orders if on-hand inventory were to drop significantly. Given current on-hand of 69 and low demand, no actual order is expected or needed this period.
