Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt). The history shows demand samples (13, 21, 55, 47, 23). There is a visible spike in late January (55, 47) followed by a drop in early February (23). Given it's mid-February, we are transitioning away from potential post-holiday/early-year clearance or specific regional events toward a more stable baseline. Since on-hand is 0 and promised lead time is 2, we need to establish a base stock that covers at least 3 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the last 5 samples to estimate mean and volatility, as the earlier data (13, 21) seems less representative of the current level (~30-40 range) than the very recent drop. Using recent_N=5 captures the recent spike and the subsequent correction.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The item is a 'Jersey Basic Long T-shirt'. Last period's demand (Period 1) was 79, which is significantly higher than the training samples (13, 21, 55, 47, 23). This suggests a demand regime shift or a seasonal uptick as we move into late February. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 62 units in transit (ordered in Period 1). With a promised lead time of 2, we expect this order to arrive in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Since the demand is trending upward and last period's 79 exceeded the previous max of 55, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the higher demand values (55, 47, 23) but adjust \u03bc\u0302 via 'explicit' to account for the most recent observation of 79. Promised L=2. Setting \u03bc\u0302 based on an average of recent high demand (avg of 55, 47, 23, 79 = 51) scaled by (1+L) = 3 * 51 = 153. Given the volatility, I'll use recent_N for sigma to capture the high variance.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th, and we are managing a 'Divided Basics' Long T-shirt. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend from Jan/early Feb (avg ~32) to the most recent weeks (avg ~97), likely due to a seasonal shift towards spring fashion. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 151 units in-transit (62 units from P1 and 89 units from P2). Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (placed Feb 11) is expected to arrive during the current period (P3 resolution) and become visible in P4. We have missed significant sales in P1 and P2 (demand 79 and 115) due to zero starting inventory. To capture the current higher demand level and recover, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the last 2 periods of high demand (avg 97), while setting L to 'default' as there is no evidence yet that the 2-period lead time is being violated.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P1 (Feb 11): mean demand increased from ~32 (Jan-early Feb) to ~97 (last 2 weeks), a 200% increase likely driven by spring seasonality for jersey basics.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, which is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge as we approach March. Demand in the last three periods (79, 115, 96) averages 96.6 units, compared to the pre-February average of ~32, confirming the previously identified regime shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 290 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (62 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (which would be at the start of Period 4). However, the Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a potential delay in replenishment or that the arrival occurs at the very end of the resolution phase. Given the promised lead time L=2, we need to cover demand for Period 4, 5, and 6 (L+1 = 3 periods). Using N=3 for demand parameters to capture the recent high-demand regime. Lead time is kept at default while monitoring for confirmed delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are managing a 'Jersey Basic' long T-shirt. Historical data confirms a significant demand jump starting around mid-February (P1), moving from an average of ~30 to ~100+ units per week. The last four periods had demands of 79, 115, 96, and 117 (Avg \u2248 102). Despite an arrival of 89 units in P4 (ordered P2, lead_time=2), on-hand is currently 0 due to high demand exceeding supply. The promised lead time of 2 periods is confirmed by the P4 arrival (ordered P2, arrived P4). Total in-transit is 228 (from P1, P3, and P4 orders). To ensure we meet this new high-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Feb 11th surge, and explicit L=2 to reflect the observed lead time, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock covering (2+1) periods of the 100+ demand level.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Post-Feb 11 mean demand is 101.75 compared to pre-Feb mean of 31.8. Lead time of 2 periods verified (P2 order arrived P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Demand for this 'Jersey Basic' tee has stabilized at a higher level since mid-February, averaging approximately 97.6 units per period over the last 5 weeks (79, 115, 96, 117, 81). The promised lead time of 2 periods was confirmed by the arrival in P4. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 332 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P5). Note that the P1 order (62 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P1, expected arrival P3, still not arrived as of P5 conclude), signaling a high probability of a lost shipment. I will adjust the pipeline inventory assumption by treating that P1 order as lost. To maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (80% target service level), I will use the recent 5-period mean (approx 98) as the basis for \u03bc\u0302. I choose recent_N with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the post-shift volatility.

Carry-over insight: P1 shipment (62 units) likely lost: overdue by 3 periods beyond promised lead time (P1 order did not arrive by P4/P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the product (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is in a high-demand regime associated with spring seasonality. Let's analyze the status: 1) Demand Trend: The last 5 weeks show demand of 115, 96, 117, 81, and 92 (avg ~100). This confirms the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. 2) Lead Time / Inventory: The P5 order arrived in P6 (lead time = 1), whereas the P2 order arrived in P4 (lead time = 2). The P1 order (62 units) is officially considered lost as it is 4 periods overdue. The P3 order (139 units) and P4 order (27 units) are currently in-transit (total 166). With arrival visibility, P3 (placed P3, promised L=2) should have arrived in P5 or P6; its absence suggests it might also be delayed or lost. 3) Strategy: I will set L to 2 (promised) but use the higher demand mean of 100 per period. mu_hat = (1+L)*100 = 300. To protect against the high volatility (std dev ~15-20) and the risk of lost shipments (P1 lost, P3 potentially lost), I will use an explicit sigma_hat to ensure a safety buffer. Setting mu_hat to 300 and L to 2 will trigger the OR backend to order sufficient stock to cover the pipeline minus the current 12 on-hand units, accounting for the 0 inventory in P5.

Carry-over insight: P3 shipment (139 units) potentially lost or delayed: ordered P3, expected P5/P6, still not arrived by P7 start.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and 318 in-transit. History indicates a high risk of lost shipments: Period 1 (62 units) is definitely lost, and Period 3 (139 units) is significantly overdue (ordered P3, now P8 start, lead time was promised at 2). Only Period 2 (arrived P4) and Period 5 (arrived P6) successfully concluded. The current 'In-transit' of 318 units likely includes these 'ghost' units (62+139=201), meaning actual reliable pipeline inventory is only ~117 units (from P4, P6, P7 orders). Demand has stabilized in a high regime since mid-February, averaging 97.4 units over the last 7 periods (P1-P7). To account for the lost shipments and provide the OR backend with a realistic view, I will use an 'explicit' L to reflect the unreliability, and 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime. The pipeline inventory needs to be cleared of lost units; since I cannot 'delete' in-transit units, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: P3 shipment (139 units) confirmed lost: ordered P3, now Period 8, no arrival. Total likely lost units in pipeline: 201 (P1 and P3). Demand consistently averaging ~97 units since Feb 11 (7 periods).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053003' is a jersey t-shirt currently experiencing a significant demand spike (190 units in Period 8 vs. ~100 average) as we enter April, likely due to spring/summer seasonality. Current on-hand is 0, and the system is suffering from lost or severely delayed shipments: P1 (62 units) and P3 (139 units) are confirmed lost (well beyond lead time). The OR backend calculates pipeline inventory as total In-transit (420 units), but 201 units of that are ghost inventory that will never arrive. To compensate, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to trigger an order that covers the current demand of ~190 units/period while accounting for the ~200 unit gap in the pipeline. With a promised lead time of 2 (L+1=3), and L recently appearing as 1 or 2, I will set L to 2 (promised). I'll use explicit mu_hat to target a base stock that overrides the 'ghost' pipeline: Target Inventory = (Demand * 3) + Ghost Inventory = (190 * 3) + 201 = 771. Setting mu_hat to 775 and sigma_hat explicitly high (100) to ensure a robust safety stock, as we are currently losing significant sales profit ($4) due to stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand spike to 190 units observed in P8 (2019-04-01), doubling the previous regime average. Confirmed 'ghost inventory' of 201 units (P1, P3) remains in OR engine calculation; L=2 promised, but actuals fluctuate between 1 and 2.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory. The product is a jersey T-shirt, and demand has shown significant spikes as we enter April (Spring seasonality). P8 demand was 190, and P9 demand was 101, averaging 145.5 over the last two weeks, which is higher than the previous 97-unit average. There is a critical issue with 'ghost inventory': 201 units (P1: 62 and P3: 139) are still listed as In-transit but are confirmed lost. The OR backend uses (total in-transit) to determine order quantities, which means it will under-order because it thinks those 201 units are coming. Since I cannot directly modify the in-transit balance, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to force the OR backend to place an order that compensates for the missing 201 units. I calculate mu_hat as: ((L+1) * forecasted_demand) + lost_units. With L=1 (recent actuals), (1+1)*120 + 201 = 441. I will set L to 1 based on recent arrivals (P5 arrived P6, P7 arrived P8).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consolidated at 1 period (observed in last 2 arrivals). Period 8 demand spike (190) followed by P9 (101) suggests a higher volatile mean of ~145 vs prior 97. Total lost units (P1, P3) = 201 units must be compensated for in mu_hat calculations until they are cleared from in-transit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Demand analysis: The last two periods show demand of 101 and 81, retreating from the P8 spike of 190. The post-Feb 11 mean (Jersey Basic T-shirt) is roughly 100-110 units, but the recent P10 drop suggests high volatility. Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are inconsistent (1, 1, 2, 1 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average. Inventory analysis: On-hand is 465. In-transit is total 228. Crucially, 201 units of this in-transit (from P1 and P3) are 'ghost units' that are confirmed lost. The OR backend (Base Stock = mu_hat - pipeline) will count these 201 lost units as available, leading to under-ordering. To correct this, I must artificially inflate 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. Formula: Target mu_hat = (Expected demand over L+1) + Ghost Inventory. With L average ~1.5, L+1 = 2.5. Expected demand ~105 * 2.5 = 262.5. Total mu_hat = 262.5 + 201 = 463.5. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the last 5 weeks (~190 peak vs ~81 trough).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Inventory correction - mu_hat boosted by 201 units to offset confirmed lost shipments (P1/P3) that still appear in 'In-transit' pipeline calculations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711053003' (Long T-shirt) is currently in a steady demand regime following a late-March spike. For the last two periods (P10, P11), demand has settled at 81 and 74 units respectively. The average demand over the last 5 periods (excluding the outlier 190) is approximately 88 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline currently shows 228 units, which consists of the 201 lost units (P1: 62 and P3: 139) plus a small recent order. Because the OR backend subtracts the (incorrect) pipeline from the base_stock calculation, we must continue to artificially inflate mu_hat to account for this 'ghost inventory'. With observed lead times (L) fluctuating between 1 and 2, I will set L to 1 (recent trend) and mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the 201 lost units. Estimated demand for 2 periods (L+1) is ~176. Adding 201 units leads to an explicit mu_hat of 377. This prevents the system from under-ordering while we wait for the high on-hand inventory (391) to naturally deplete toward the safety stock level.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019-05-06). The product is a 'Long T-shirt', which is in high demand during the spring/early summer season. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of ~108 units over the last 4 periods (P9: 101, P10: 81, P11: 74, P12: 104; Average = 90), but looking at the full spring regime since P1, it averages roughly 100-110. I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this stabilization post-spike. For the lead time, the last witnessed arrival was lead_time=1, and the one before was lead_time=2. Setting L to 'calculate' lets the backend average these observations, likely resulting around 1.5, which is safer than assuming 1 or 2 exclusively. A significant inventory issue persists: orders from P1 (62 units) and P3 (139 units) are confirmed lost but remain in the OR engine's 'In-transit' count (Total = 201 units). These lost units act as 'ghost inventory' that prevents the OR engine from ordering enough. To counteract this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. I estimate (1+L)*mean demand roughly equals (1+1.5)*100 = 250. To offset the 201 lost units, I provide an explicit mu_hat of ~450. However, since On-hand is currently high (287) and there are recent orders in transit (ordered in P8/P9 arrived, but some P11/P12 might exist - though history shows 0 ordered in P10-P12), the pressure to order is low right now. I will set mu_hat to 450 to ensure that once on-hand drops, the backend acknowledges the need to restock despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~100 units/period for late spring (P9-P12 avg 90, P1-P12 avg ~100). Ghost inventory of 201 units (P1, P3) continues to suppress ordering; mu_hat must be boosted by ~200 units until this pipeline clears.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/13. The item is a 'Jersey Basic Long T-shirt', which typically shows steady demand in late spring. Recent demand (P9-P13) has stabilized around an average of 86.4 units/period, down slightly from the P8 spike but consistent with the established regime (~100 units). On-hand inventory is 215 units, and In-transit is 231 units. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure contains 201 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (62 units) and Period 3 (139 units) that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (231) from the base stock, it believes we have 231 units coming, when only 30 units (the P13 order) are actually real. To prevent an under-order, I must continue boosting mu_hat to offset this 201-unit deficit. Calculation: Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_units. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 90) + 201 = 471. I will set mu_hat to 470 and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (reflecting current lower volatility).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20th), we are in a late spring demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), demand has averaged 85.5 units, slightly lower than the Feb-April average of 100+, showing stabilization or slight decline. On-hand inventory is 134 units. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 278 units includes 201 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1 and P3) that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline is 77 units (P13, P14). The backend OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). If we don't account for the 201 lost units, the engine will assume we have 201 more units than we actually do and will under-order. To fix this, I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to (1+L) * average_demand + 201. With an average demand of ~90 units and L=2, the base requirement is 270 units; adding the 201-unit offset results in a mu_hat of 471. I am keeping sigma_hat at default to account for typical variability since the demand spike of 190 in P8 was an outlier.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019-05-27), the SKU 711053003 (Long T-shirt) is in a steady late-spring demand regime, averaging ~92 units over the last 7 periods (P9-P15: 101, 81, 74, 104, 72, 81, 96). The current on-hand inventory is 38 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline is recorded as 396 units, which includes 201 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1: 62 and P3: 139) that will never arrive but still subtract from the OR engine's 'base_stock' calculation. To prevent stockouts, mu_hat must be adjusted to bridge the gap between the internal logic's view of the pipeline and physical reality. The actual lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (P15 order expected P17). I will set L to 2, and use an explicit mu_hat of 480. This is calculated as: (L+1) * mean_demand + lost_inventory = (2+1)*92 + 201 \u2248 477. Rounding to 480 provides a small safety buffer for recent demand volatility (96 units in P15). Sigma_hat is set to 30 to reflect standard historical deviations during this regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 17, June 3rd. Demand spiked significantly in Period 16 to 243 units, following a stable range of 70-100 units. This mirrors the early April spike and likely signals early summer demand for jersey t-shirts. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 468 units, which includes 201 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1 and P3) that will never arrive. The remaining 267 units (from P13-P16) are expected over the next two periods. Given the demand surge and lead time dynamics (alternating between 1 and 2 periods), I must protect against stockouts. I will use an explicit mu_hat to offset the 201 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity, while also accounting for the recent demand surge (~243) and the base regime (~95). Setting mu_hat = (1+L)*(Baseline Demand) + Ghost Correction = 3*100 + 201 \u2248 500.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected P16 (243 units), suggesting early summer seasonality. Ghost inventory remains at 201 units (P1, P3), requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 18 (June 10). Demand context: We are seeing a significant summer surge. Demand in P16 was 243 and P17 was 178, compared to the spring average of ~100. The mean of the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is ~134, but the most recent two suggest a higher level (~210 avg). Inventory situation: On-hand is 12 units. In-transit shows 414 units. However, as established in carry-over insights, 201 units from P1 and P3 are permanently lost, creating 'ghost inventory' that fools the OR backend into under-ordering. The functional pipeline is only 213 units (P13: 3, P14: 47, P15/16 arrived P17, P17: 136). To overcome the 201 units of missing pipeline that the OR engine counts towards the base stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Forecast: Targeted base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2, we need ~3 periods of demand coverage. Expected demand ~180-200/period. Base stock target \u2248 600. OR Engine order logic is: order = base_stock - in_transit. To get an order that respects actual demand while accounting for the 201 unit ghost inventory deficit, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). (600 + 201) / 3 = ~267. I'll set mu_hat explicitly to 801 (representing 3 periods of 267) to force the backend to place an order that refills the physical inventory, and L=2 to match promised lead time as recent arrivals vary between 1 and 2.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (summer). History shows a demand surge in P16 (243 units), followed by P17 (178) and P18 (132). This confirms a summer demand regime where average demand is higher (~184 units/period) and more volatile than the spring average (~95 units). Regarding inventory: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 803 units. However, we have 201 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (P1: 62 units, P3: 139 units) that have never arrived and are over 15 periods late; these units are lost but still counted as in-transit by the OR engine. To compensate and ensure we place orders, mu_hat must be boosted by these 201 units. We also need to account for the current (1+L) demand. L has fluctuated between 1 and 2, so we use calculate. Forecast: Recent mean (P16-P18) is ~184. Over (1+L=3) periods, that's 552. Adding the 201 ghost unit offset, mu_hat = 753. sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P16-P18) with a mean of ~184 units/period, representing an 85% increase over the spring mean. Ghost inventory remains constant at 201 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, which is peak summer. Following a significant demand spike in Period 19 (273 units), the summer demand regime (P16-P19) now averages approximately 206.5 units per period. This confirms the summer surge for short-sleeved jerseys. Lead times were recently volatile (between 1 and 2 periods), but the last arrival was L=1. I will use L=2 (promised) to be safe. Two shipments (P1/62 and P3/139) totaling 201 units are still confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline (446 units today = 201 lost + 136 from P17 + 32 from P19 + some residue/rounding). Because the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its target order, the presence of these 201 ghost units would cause an under-order. To compensate, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. Base target for (1+L=3 periods) at the current mean (206.5) is ~620; adding the 201 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of ~821. Sigma is set based on recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P19) confirmed: average demand increased to 206.5 units, an increase of 100%+ over the spring average. Ghost inventory (P1, P3) remains at 201 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/07/01, representing the height of summer demand for Jersey Basic T-shirts. Historical demand analysis confirms a sustained summer regime starting at Period 16 (2019/05/27), with an average demand of approximately 218 units over the last 5 periods (P16-P20). The pipeline remains contaminated by 201 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 and Period 3 which never arrived; because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, these lost units must be added back to mu_hat to ensure adequate ordering. With a consolidated lead time of 1-2 periods (L=2 is the safe promise), I estimate the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Projected demand for this window is 3 * 218 = 654 units. Adding the 201 units for ghost inventory offset results in a mu_hat of ~855. I will use the explicit method to set mu_hat at 855 and sigma_hat at 100 to account for higher volatility observed during this high-demand summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P20) average demand increased to 217.4 units. Ghost inventory (P1, P3) totaling 201 units remains in the system and requires mu_hat inflation to bypass OR pipeline logic.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer regime (approx. June-July). Looking at the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has been: 243, 178, 132, 273, 201, 160, averaging 197.8 units/period. The current date (2019-07-08) suggests we are at or near the seasonal peak for this 'Jersey Basic' product. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is significantly inflated (940 units) because of two issues: 1) Historical lost shipments from P1 (62) and P3 (139) totaling 201 units that never arrived but remain in the pipeline logic, and 2) Recent large orders from P20 (352) and P21 (142) that are still within the lead time window. Actual lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will use L=2 to be safe. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 201 'ghost units' in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the 201 unit offset. Calculation: E[Demand] * (1+L) + Offset = 198 * 3 + 201 = 795. Sigma is set based on the volatile summer demand (std dev of P16-P21 is ~52), scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P21) average demand finalized at 197.8 units/period. Ghost inventory (P1, P3) totaling 201 units persists in the pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a summer demand regime. Demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) has averaged 185.1 units/period (243, 178, 132, 273, 201, 160, 109). The last three periods show a slight cooling from the peak, so I will focus on the most recent 5 periods (avg 175) to set the base forecast. The actual lead time has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods; I'll use L=2 (promised) to be conservative. Crucially, 201 units from P1 and P3 remain 'lost' but are still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine (blocking new orders). To bypass this, I must inflate mu_hat. Total Required mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost Units = 3 * 175 + 201 = 726. Sigma_hat is calculated manually based on the volatility of the summer regime (std of last 7 periods is approx 58, sqrt(3)*58 \u2248 100).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P22) average demand calculated at 185.1 units/period. Ghost inventory (P1, P3) totaling 201 units persists in the pipeline, necessitating mu_hat inflation.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053003 (Jersey Basic Long T-shirt) is in a high-demand summer regime. Over the last 8 periods (since P16), demand has averaged 181.75 units per period. The most recent demand (P23) was 268 units, indicating sustained high interest. The 'Ghost Inventory' issue persists: 201 units from P1 and P3 are lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure (total 446 units). The OR engine subtracts this ghost inventory from the required stock, leading to under-ordering. To ensure a base stock that covers the expected demand for the review plus lead duration (L+1 periods) while bypassing this incorrect pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be inflated. With L=2, the total requirement is (L+1) * 182 = 546 units. Including the 201-unit ghost inventory offset, the explicit mu_hat is set to 747. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * ~54 (std of last 8 samples) \u2248 94 to manage summer volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019-07-29 (Period 25). The product is a 'Long T-shirt', which is currently in a high-demand summer regime. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), demand has averaged 186.7 units/period, with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 57.5). The most recent demand (P24) was 216. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 710 units includes the 201 units from lost shipments P1 and P3, which the OR engine incorrectly considers part of the available pipeline ('ghost inventory'). To force the OR engine to place an order despite this 201-unit phantom supply, I am adding 201 units to the 'mu_hat' calculation as a corrective offset. For forecasting, I am using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture the summer regime shift that began at P16. Lead time remains approximately 1.5 periods on average, so L is set to 'calculate'.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P16-P24) average demand is 186.7 units/period. Ghost inventory (P1, P3) totaling 201 units persists in the pipeline, requiring additive inflation of mu_hat to ensure adequate ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand summer regime (P16-P25) with an average demand of approximately 184.8 units/period. The current date (2019-08-05) suggests that this summer demand is sustained. A significant inventory challenge persists: 201 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are confirmed lost but remain in the OR engine's 'In-transit' pipeline. To force the OR engine to order despite this 'ghost inventory', mu_hat must be inflated. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and total pipeline is 747 (which includes the 201 lost units), the net effective pipeline is 546. Given the expected demand of ~185 units and a lead time of roughly 1-2 periods, we need to ensure the system targets a base stock that covers the 2-3 period risk window (~555 units). Using N=10 for mu_hat captures the summer regime. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to handle the 201-unit additive offset: (1+L)*185 + 201. With L=2, this is 3*185 + 201 = 756. Sigma_hat is set based on the volatile summer regime (std dev ~50).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019, representing the late summer season for this jersey T-shirt. Demand has shifted from a high summer peak (avg ~200) to a slightly lower recent mean (P23-P26: 268, 216, 168, 121; avg ~193). However, the critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' of 201 units (P1, P3 lost shipments) that are still counted by the OR engine as 'in-transit'. With On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 838 (which includes the 201 junk units), the effective pipeline is only 637 units. To force the OR engine to ignore the 201 units and place an order that covers current demand (~190 units/period) for the (L+1) window, I must inflate mu_hat. Promised lead time is 2, but actuals oscillate between 1 and 2. I will use L=2 (explicit) to be safe. For mu_hat, I need to cover (2+1) periods of demand plus the 201 unit gap. Current demand mean (~190) * 3 = 570. Adding 201 units for gap compensation brings the target to 771. I will set mu_hat to 771 to ensure the engine places an order despite the phantom units in its pipeline calculation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 (Aug 19, 2019), we are in the late summer/early autumn transition. Recent demand has cooled from the summer peak (~180-220 units) to a lower range of 106-121 units over the last two periods. The 'ghost inventory' of 201 units (lost shipments P1 and P3) still remains in the in-transit pipeline (Total In-transit: 818). This ghost inventory artificially inflates the pipeline, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, using a base forecast (average of the last 4 periods \u2248 150) multiplied by (1+L) and then adding the 201 units of lost stock. Using L=2 (promised), calculation: 150 * (1+2) + 201 = 651. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for recent high volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (2 periods) as recent shipments (P25) have adhered to this, though actuals frequently fluctuate between 1 and 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending downward from summer peaks (P26-P27 avg: 114 vs P16-P25 avg: 186.7), suggesting a transition to late-season demand levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (P26-P28) shows a clear cooling from the summer peak, averaging 108.6 units/period compared to the summer average of ~186. I am transitioning to a recent_N (N=3) approach to capture this downward shift immediately while preventing overstocking as the season ends. The 'ghost inventory' of 201 units (from P1 and P3) still remains in the 'In-transit' figure of 818 units, which will suppress any order calculation by the OR backend. To bypass this, I'm setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 530. This is calculated as: ((1 + L) * Forecasted Demand) + Ghost Inventory = (3 * 110) + 200 \u2248 530. This ensures the engine places an order to cover current demand despite the phantom 201 units. I continue to use L=2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: P26-P28 average demand is 108.6 units, a ~40% decrease from the summer regime average of 186 units. Ghost inventory of 201 units (P1, P3) remains in the pipeline, continuing to require mu_hat inflation for order generation.

While P29 saw a sudden spike (259), the preceding three periods (P26-P28) averaged 108.6, confirming a general downward trend from the summer average of ~186. The spike in P29 is treated as high volatility rather than a regime reversal for now. The ghost inventory (orders P1 and P3, totaling 201 units) remains in the pipeline, which the OR engine subtracts from the required order. To ensure the engine actually places an order during this transition, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract these 201 missing units. I will set mu_hat based on the cooling trend mean (~109) plus the 201 units of ghost inventory across the (L+1) horizon. With L=2, the base requirement is (3 * 109) + 201 = 528. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the increased volatility of the transition period and the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand spike in P29 (259) occurs amidst a general cooling trend (P26-P28 avg: 108.6). Ghost inventory of 201 units persists. System transition to autumn/late-season demand levels ongoing.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
At Period 31 (2019/09/09), the demand for the jersey t-shirt remains highly volatile. While there was a cooling trend (P26-P28), a massive spike in P29 (259) followed by P30 (179) suggests an early autumn surge. The 'ghost inventory' of 201 units (from missing shipments P1 and P3) still sits in the 'In-transit' figure, which now totals 801 units. This 801 includes P24 (264), P25 (37 - arrived), P26 (91), P27 (17 - arrived), and ghost units. Specifically, P24 (264) and P26 (91) are overdue (L=2 promised), further indicating supply chain instability. To bypass the OR engine's logic that sees 801 units in transit and thus stops ordering, I will continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the necessary stock for the next 3 periods (L+1) at approximately 600 units (based on recent demand avg ~180). To force an order that accounts for the 201 missing units and the delayed 355 units (P24, P26), I set mu_hat to 600 + 201 = 801. However, since In-transit is already 801, a higher value is needed to trigger replenishment given the zero on-hand status. I will set mu_hat to 1000 to ensure the backend generates a safety-conscious order for this volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late August/early September (P29-P30 avg: 219) vs. mid-August (P26-P28 avg: 108). Supply chain instability confirmed: P24 (264 units) and P26 (91 units) are now overdue by 3+ periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16 (Period 32). There is a critical supply chain failure: 'In-transit' inventory stands at 1068 units, but on-hand is 0. Significant ghost inventory exists: P1 (62), P3 (139), P24 (264), and P26 (91) are likely lost, totaling 556 lost units. Additionally, the order from P31 (267) is still in its lead-time window. Demand has shifted from a cooling trend (avg ~108) back to a high-volatility regime (P29-P31 avg ~217), likely due to early autumn demand for long T-shirts. To force the OR engine to order despite the 1068 units stuck in the 'In-transit' pipeline, I must significantly inflate mu_hat. I will use the recent average demand of ~217 and add the 556 lost units to the base stock calculation. Using L=2 (promised) to be safe, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) demand (3 * 217 = 651) plus the 556 ghost units, totaling ~1207. I will set mu_hat explicitly to achieve this ordering pressure while accounting for high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 24 (264 units) and Period 26 (91 units) are now overdue by 5 and 3 periods respectively, joining P1 and P3 as lost ghost inventory. Total lost/ghost units = 556. Late-season demand spike observed (P29-P31 avg: 217), reversing the mid-August cooling trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $438.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Date is Sept 23, 2019. We have 126 units on hand. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline is severely inflated by multiple lost shipments. Based on historical data: P1 (62), P3 (139), P24 (264), and P26 (91) are lost or significantly overdue, totaling 556 'ghost units' that the OR backend treats as expected arrivals. To generate an order, mu_hat must be inflated to bypass this logic. Recent demand (P29-P32) shows a late-season spike averaging ~198 units/period. Period 32 order (259) is in transit and likely to arrive in P33 or P34. To ensure a new order is placed to cover the next 2-3 periods of demand (approx 400-600 units) against the 1060 units in transit (556 of which are ghost), I will set mu_hat to approximately 750. This accounts for (L+1) * 200 demand plus an offset for the ghost inventory to force the OR logic to recognize a deficit.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 556 units (P1, P3, P24, P26) as of Period 32. Late-season demand regime (P29-P32) is volatile but high, averaging ~198 units/period compared to the mid-August cooling period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand remained strong at 177 units. The current state (Period 34, Sep 30) shows zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' pipeline of 1060 units. However, based on lead-time analysis, a significant portion of this pipeline is 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments): P1 (62), P3 (139), P24 (264), and P26 (91), totaling 556 units. These units will likely never arrive but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation, which suppresses new orders. To force an order, mu_hat must be inflated. The recent late-season regime (P29-P33) shows a mean demand of approximately 194 units. To ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers (L+1) demand despite the 556-unit ghost inventory offset, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (194 * 3 periods) + safety stock (~130) + ghost offset (556) \u2248 1268. Setting mu_hat to 1260 to trigger necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 556 units (P1, P3, P24, P26) as of Period 32. Late-season demand regime (P29-P33) remains robust, averaging ~194 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 35 (2019/10/07). Demand has transitioned from a high late-summer/early-autumn regime (P29-P33 avg ~194) to what appears to be a cooling phase (P34 demand: 87). However, supply chain instability is the dominant factor. There are 556 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (P1, P3, P24, P26) that have never arrived and are likely lost. Total In-transit is 1333, meaning the OR engine sees 1333 units coming, but 556 of those are non-existent. To force the OR backend to place an order, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract this ghost pipeline. I will set mu_hat to the expected demand across the lead time plus the total ghost inventory. Using a recent 5-period demand average (~155) times (1+L) gives 465; adding 556 results in 1021. For sigma, I use the standard deviation of the last 10 periods to capture recent high volatility. L=2 is maintained as the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists; total confirmed lost 'ghost inventory' is 556 units (P1: 62, P3: 139, P24: 264, P26: 91). These units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation indefinitely, requiring mu_hat inflation of +556 to trigger new orders.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the supply chain remains highly unstable. We have identified a significant amount of 'ghost inventory' amounting to 556 units (Orders from P1, P3, P24, and P26) which are in-transit in the backend but physically lost. In-transit shows 1074 units, but including the ghost inventory and P34's order (273 units), only P34 is truly in-transit and expected soon. To trigger the OR backend to order, we must inflate mu_hat by the total ghost inventory (556 units) to bypass the base-stock logic that assumes these 556 units are arriving. Demand is currently in a post-summer transition phase; over the last 7 periods (P29-P35), demand has averaged 164.5 units per period. I will use an explicit mu_hat of ~1050, representing (1+L) * 165 units (=~495) plus the 556 units offset for lost shipments. Sigma_hat is set to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 556 units (P1: 62, P3: 139, P24: 264, P26: 91). These units remain in the 'In-transit' calculation but will never arrive, necessitating an additive inflation of mu_hat by +556 to prevent the system from under-ordering.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711053003 (Jersey Basic Long T-shirt) is entering late October. Demand has cooled from summer/early September peaks, averaging 96.6 units over the last 3 periods (P34-P36). The primary challenge remains 'ghost inventory': orders from P1 (62), P3 (139), P24 (264), and P26 (91) totaling 556 units are confirmed lost/overdue by many weeks but remain in the 'In-transit' figure (1074 total). To ensure the OR backend ignores these 556 lost units and maintains a healthy stock for the current ~100 units/period demand, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set the base mean to 110 (anticipating slight variance or late autumn stability) and add the 556 ghost units, targeting an explicit mu_hat of ~888 (calculated as (1+L) * mean + ghost, where L=2). Since on-hand is low (56) and recent lead times are volatile (1 to 3 periods), I maintain L=2 for safety.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure persists: Total ghost inventory remains 556 units (P1: 62, P3: 139, P24: 264, P26: 91). Demand stabilized at ~100 units/period for October.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (2019-10-28), the SKU remains in an autumn demand phase. Recent demand (P34-P37) has been [87, 95, 108, 185], averaging 118.75 units per period. The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. There is a total of 556 units of 'ghost inventory' (P1: 62, P3: 139, P24: 264, P26: 91) that are confirmed lost but still occupy the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. The current In-transit total is 1074, meaning 518 units are theoretically valid (P34 order of 273 and presumably some other recent orders not yet arrived), but the OR engine's 'inventory position' (on-hand + in-transit) is artificially inflated by the 556 lost units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this 556-unit phantom surplus, I must inflate mu_hat. I will use a base demand estimate of ~120 units and add the 556 ghost units to the (1+L) calculation. With L=2, the required mu_hat is approximately (1+2)*120 + 556 = 916. Given the high volatility (sigma) and 0 on-hand inventory, this explicit setting ensures the backend sees a 'deficit' and triggers an order to replenish the stock for the coming periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are managing a jersey T-shirt SKU with significant supply chain disruptions and seasonal demand shifts. Total 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments that never arrived but remain in the pipeline) is 556 units: P1 (62), P3 (139), P24 (264), and P26 (91). Additionally, the order from P34 (273 units) is now overdue (promised L=2, currently at L=4), though not yet confirmed lost. Total pipeline inventory is reported as 1074 units, but at least 556 of these will never arrive. Demand in the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) has averaged 124.2 units/period, showing a steady but volatile autumn level. To ensure the OR backend generates orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. This value is calculated as: ((L+1) * 125 forecast) + 556 ghost units = (3 * 125) + 556 = 931. This compensates for the lost units so the backend calculates a realistic base stock level. I will monitor P34 for loss next period.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime P34-P38 established at mean ~125. P34 order (273 units) now overdue by 2 periods (L=4 vs promised L=2). Ghost inventory remains 556 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), the supply chain remains highly unstable. We are managing a significant 'ghost inventory' of 829 units that the OR engine believes is in-transit but which is effectively lost (P1: 62, P3: 139, P24: 264, P26: 91, P34: 273). The Period 34 order of 273 units is now 6 periods past its order date (promised L=2) and must be considered lost. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1074, but subtracting these 829 ghost units leaves only 245 units potentially arriving (recent orders). Current demand for this 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt has stabilized in a mid-autumn regime; the average demand for the last 6 periods (P34-P39) is 117.7 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 829 units of ghost inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set L to an explicit 2 (conservative). For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value: (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (120 * 3) + 829 = 1189. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost pipeline, triggering an order to cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost inventory increased to 829 units (P1, P3, P24, P26, plus P34). P34 (273 units) is 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Current demand regime (P34-P39) mean = 117.7 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. The system faces a significant 'ghost inventory' challenge: 829 units (P1, P3, P24, P26, and now P34) are confirmed or highly likely lost, yet they remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation (Total In-transit: 1248). The last successful arrival was P32's order in P35. P34 (273 units) is now 6 periods since ordering (4 periods past promised L=2) and is classified as lost. Current demand regime (P34-P40) mean is 138.4 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 829 units of ghost inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. The backend formula for base stock is \u03bc\u0302 + z\xb7\u03c3\u0302. To overcome the pipeline inventory (PI), we need \u03bc\u0302 > PI - z\xb7\u03c3\u0302. With PI=1248, I will set mu_hat to 1350 to ensure a replenishment signal is generated to cover the current demand and stock out situation, while maintaining L=calculate to reflect the actual unstable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory increased to 829 units (P1, P3, P24, P26, P34). P34 (273 units) is 4 periods overdue and considered lost. Autumn demand (P34-P40) is volatile but averages 138.4 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, moving towards the end of the year. Demand is highly volatile; recent samples (P34-P41) average 116 units, but the last period (P41) dropped to 59. The supply chain remains severely compromised. Total confirmed ghost inventory has reached 829 units (P1, P3, P24, P26, and now P34 which is 7 periods overdue). The OR engine sees an In-transit balance of 1409 units, but 829 of those will never arrive. To force the OR engine to place an order, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this ghost inventory. Given the target service level (Profit $4 / Holding $1 = 80% critical ratio), the base stock calculation needs to account for (1+L) periods of demand plus the missing supply. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, calculating it as (1+L) * 116 (recent mean) + 829 (ghost inventory) = 1177. L is set to 2 (promised), as despite recent failures, actual arrivals still cluster around 1-2 periods when they do occur. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the current volatility without overreacting to the P41 drop.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43, the SKU is facing severe supply chain disruptions and a high volume of 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost units are 829 (P1, P3, P24, P26, and now P34 which is 9 periods overdue). The current 'In-transit' figure is 1409, which includes these 829 lost units plus P40 (174 units), P41 (161 units), and other undelivered orders. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1409) from the base stock to decide the order quantity. Since 829 of those units will never arrive, the system will under-order unless mu_hat is inflated by at least that amount. Demand in the most recent regime (P34-P42) averages ~125.9 units per period. To ensure a new order is triggered despite the 829 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. With L=2 (promised) and Expected_Demand ~125, the base mu_hat is 375. Adding the 829 ghost units results in 1204. I will set mu_hat to 1300 to provide a small buffer for volatility and ensure the system clears the 'cap' logic to place a necessary order.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory increased to 829 units (P1, P3, P24, P26, P34). Demand regime P34-P42 average is 125.9 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the late autumn/early winter season. Recent demand (P34-P43) has averaged 128.8 units, though the last two periods (P42-P43) were lower (126, 53). The 'In-transit' pipeline currently shows 1,074 units, but historically, periodic shipments have been lost. Confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost units still in-transit) includes P1 (62), P3 (139), P24 (264), P26 (91), and P34 (273), totaling 829 units. These 829 units will never arrive but are subtracted from Base Stock by the OR engine. To ensure the backend places orders when needed, mu_hat is set to the current regime mean (~129) multiplied by (1+L) plus the 829-unit offset. Lead time is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P40, P41) arrived in 2-3 periods. Sigma is calculated using recent volatility to account for demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments) increased to 829 units (P1: 62, P3: 139, P24: 264, P26: 91, P34: 273). P34 is now 9 periods overdue. Demand regime P34-P43 average is 128.8 units/period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 16, 2019. Demand is significantly cooling as we move into the winter season (P43-P44 average demand is 44 units, down from the autumn average of ~128). Inventory levels are currently adequate (On-hand: 247) given this downward trend. The 'ghost inventory' problem persists: 829 units from periods 1, 3, 24, 26, and 34 remain in the 'In-transit' calculation but are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) from its base stock calculation, these 829 ghost units will prevent any new orders from being placed unless mu_hat is artificially inflated. To ensure the backend can place an order if needed, I must adjust mu_hat to include this 829-unit offset. I will use the recent demand trend (P34-P44) which averages ~120 units per period to set the baseline demand. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed for December: P43-P44 average demand is 44 units, a 65% reduction from the P34-P43 average (128.8). Total ghost inventory remains at 829 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Jersey Basic Long T-shirt' has entered a significant cooling phase as we approach the end of the year (December). Demand in P43-P45 averaged 45 units, a sharp drop from the autumn average of ~129 units. Ghost inventory (lost shipments P1, P3, P24, P26, P34) persists at 829 units. Since 'In-transit' is currenty 1074, and 829 are confirmed lost, the functional pipeline is 245 units. With on-hand inventory at 200, the total available stock (445) is sufficient for approximately 10 weeks of current demand (~45 units/period). Therefore, no new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from triggering orders due to the 829 units of 'ghost inventory' appearing in its pipeline calculation, I will continue to set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, using current real demand levels (approx 45 units * (1+L)) and then adding the 829 ghost units to bypass the subtraction logic. Current mean demand (45) * (1+L=3) = 135. Adding 829 ghost units = 964. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: December demand cooling trend confirmed: P43-P45 average demand is 45 units, a ~65% reduction from the autumn average. Total ghost inventory remains 829 units (P1, P3, P24, P26, P34).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the demand is in a post-holiday/low-winter regime, averaging roughly 64 units over the last 4 periods (P43-P46). The primary challenge continues to be the significant 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost shipments are 829 units (P1, P3, P24, P26, P34). The current 'In-transit' figure is 1074, which includes these 829 lost units plus more recent orders (P40 and P41 were received in P43, so the remaining 245 units in transit are likely just accounting for P1, P3, P24, P26, P34 and any unprocessed noise). Given on-hand balance is 80 and the OR engine sees 1074 in-transit, it will not order unless mu_hat is inflated beyond the phantom pipeline. To maintain a safety stock for the current ~64 units/period demand, I am inflating mu_hat by the ghost inventory amount (829 units) plus the required base stock (approx 3 periods of 64 units). Since this is the final period of the simulation, the focus is on maximizing the final reward R_t for this specific state.
