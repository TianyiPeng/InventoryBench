Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Skirt Mini Bea', a denim short skirt. Historical data shows a clear upward trend: 0, 24, 125, 150, 153 units over the last 5 weeks. This suggests a seasonal 'early spring' ramp-up. The average of the last 3 samples is approximately 143 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the decision window covers L+1 = 3 periods. To avoid stockouts during this growth phase, I will use recent history (N=3) to estimate demand and volatility, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for 3 periods (~430 units plus safety stock) while considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which justifies a high service level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Skirt Mini Bea', a denim short skirt. Historical data shows demand increasing significantly: 0 -> 24 -> 125 -> 150 -> 153. Period 1 demand was 99, but we sold 0 units because on-hand inventory was 0. We have 168 units in transit from Period 1's order. Promised lead time is 2, so this order is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in Period 4). For Period 2, we must prepare for continued high demand as we enter the spring season. Since the recent demand average (last 4 weeks) is approximately 130 per week (125, 150, 153, 99), using recent_N=4 for mu_hat will capture the current level. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility of this ramp-up phase. L is kept at default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a denim mini skirt. Historical demand data from late January/early February shows a significant regime shift: demand jumped from 0-24 units to 125-153 units, likely due to spring season preparation. Recent demand in Period 1 (99) and Period 2 (102) suggests a stable high-demand regime, though slightly lower than the initial peak. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 342 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since the P1 order (placed at the start of P1) is expected to arrive during P3, it is not yet visible in the 'Period 2 conclude' message. I will use the last 4 samples (P1, P2, and the two weeks prior to simulation start) to estimate demand, as they capture the current 'active' season better than the full history. L is kept at the default (2) as there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019/3/4) shows high tension. We have zero on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units despite a total demand of 276 units over the first three periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1 (168 units), 2 (174 units), and 3 (121 units). Promised lead time is 2, so the Period 1 order (ordered 2019/2/11) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, the Period 3 'conclude' message (read now) shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the Period 1 order did not arrive within the promised 2-period window (it would have arrived during P3 resolution). We are either facing a lead-time extension or lost shipments. Data to date (Demand: 0, 24, 125, 150, 153 from historical + 99, 102, 75 from game history) suggests a mean demand around 90-110 per week. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+2=3) periods. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the delay, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the recent game demand levels using N=3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees rising demand as spring approaches in the northern hemisphere. Historical demand shows a significant jump around late January/early February (125, 150, 153), followed by a lower stable phase in the recent 4 periods (99, 102, 75, 82). Period 4 conclude confirms an arrival from Period 2 with a lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, the order from Period 1 (168 units) is now overdue (placed Period 1, promised lead time 2, should have arrived in Period 3). It remains in 'In-transit' but hasn't arrived. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the confirmed 2-period arrival. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 samples (P0-P4) average around 102 units/period, but to be conservative given the recent minor dip and the missing stock, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current stable regime (avg ~90). Sigma_hat will use the recent 4 periods to reflect current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a denim mini skirt. Historically, demand showed an early peak (weeks of Jan 21-Feb 4: ~142 avg) and has since stabilized downward (last 5 weeks: 99, 102, 75, 82, 69; avg ~85). The promised lead time is 2, and Period 4's arrival confirmed a lead_time of 2. However, the order from Period 1 (168 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery and has not arrived; it is likely lost. The order from Period 3 (121 units) is expected to arrive during this period (Period 6) as its lead time is 2. Currently, on-hand is low (23), and we face a stockout risk if the P3 order doesn't arrive as expected. I will set L to the default (2), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat (approx 85 * 3 = 255) to reflect the recent demand stabilization, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while ignoring the early-season spikes.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 1 (168 units) likely lost (overdue by 3 periods). Demand stabilized around 85 units/period starting Period 1 after initial Jan spike.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is a denim mini skirt, which is moving into its peak spring/summer season. Historical demand shows a spike in late Jan (likely early season interest), followed by a stabilized regime from P1-P6. Demand values: P1: 99, P2: 102, P3: 75, P4: 82, P5: 69, P6: 53. The mean demand of this recent 6-period regime is approx 80 units/week. Inventory is currently 0. Lead time history: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), but the Period 1 order (168 units) is now 4 periods overdue (6 periods since order) and is considered lost. The Period 3 order (121 units) should have arrived in P5 or P6 but is also missing, though only 1-2 periods overdue. To compensate for potential supply instability or lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly accounting for a 1-period buffer over promised L=2). For Mu_hat, I'll use the recent regime (last 6 periods) mean of ~80. mu_hat = (1+3)*80 = 320. For Sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the variance of this stable period.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Supply instability confirmed; P1 order (168 units) lost, P3 order (121 units) now 2 periods overdue.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The item is a denim mini skirt. Review of history shows a massive demand spike in Period 7 (273 units), likely driven by seasonal warming or a spring promotion. Previous demand was averaging ~80 units. I will use an explicit \u03bc\u0302 to capture this step-change, forecasting demand at 200 units/period (weighted towards the recent spike but acknowledging it might be an outlier compared to the 75-102 range). Lead time issues are severe: Period 1 order (168 units) is lost. Period 3 order (121 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P3, promised P5, now P8) and is likely lost. Only Period 2 arrived on time. Total 'In-transit' is 382 units, which likely includes the lost P1 (168) and P3 (121) orders, meaning real reliable pipeline is only the P7 order (93 units). With 0 on-hand and unreliable shipments, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to force the OR backend to increase the base stock level to cover the longer horizon and potential losses, and set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to (1+3)*200 = 800 to ensure a large order is triggered to rebuild stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Demand spiked from ~80 to 273 (+240%) in P7. Supply failure confirmed: orders from Period 1 and Period 3 are lost (more than 3 periods overdue). Reliable pipeline is significantly lower than 'In-transit' display.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skirt Mini Bea' is entering its peak spring season (early April), but we face massive stockouts and logistics issues. Historical demand shows a mid-March spike (273 units) followed by 126 in Period 8, averaging ~200 units/period for this regime. However, the supply chain is extremely unreliable. Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (289 units total) are confirmed lost as they are 5+ periods overdue. Only the Period 7 order (93 units) arrived successfully with a lead time of 1 period, but it was immediately sold out. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' of 613 units includes the lost 289 units, meaning the 'real' pipeline is only 324 units (ordered in Period 8). To fix the inventory gap, I am setting L to 2 (promised) and using an explicit mu_hat of 600 (3 periods * 200/period) to reflect the new seasonal demand level. I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 173 (sqrt(3) * 100) to account for high volatility seen in the transition to spring.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders from P1 and P3 (289 units) are permanently lost. Period 7 order arrived in 1 period, suggesting variable actual lead times (1-2 periods). Demand regime shifted to ~200 units/period starting P7 as spring seasonality began.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the SKU (Mini Denim Skirt) is entering its peak spring/summer season. Demand has been highly volatile but shows an upward shift (avg ~150 over the last 3 periods vs ~80 earlier). On-hand inventory is currently 0. I must account for significant supply chain issues: orders from P1 (168) and P3 (121) are confirmed lost, totaling 289 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 885 units includes these ghosts; the true reliable pipeline is 596 units (885 - 289). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to reach the target base stock, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate weekly demand at 160 units (reflecting the recent regime including the P7 spike and seasonal ramp-up). For a lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods: 160 * 3 = 480. However, because the backend considers the full 885 in-transit, it would under-order. I will set mu_hat to 769 (480 target + 289 lost units) to force the policy to compensate for the lost inventory and ensure the on-hand stock recovers for the spring peak.

Carry-over insight: True reliable pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 289 units (lost from P1 and P3). Demand regime is shifting higher due to spring seasonality for denim skirts.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the 'In-transit' count of 461 units is misleading because orders from Period 1 (168 units) and Period 3 (121 units), totaling 289 units, are permanently lost (over 8 periods overdue). The actual reliable pipeline is 172 units (ordered in P10). On-hand inventory is 508 units. Demand for this denim mini skirt spiked in P7 (273) and has since averaged 107 units over the last 4 periods (P7-P10). Spring seasonality is active. The actual lead time has stabilized between 1-2 periods (recent arrivals at 1 and 2 periods). I am using 'explicit' L=2 to be safe. I set mu_hat using 'explicit' value of 360 to cover 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted mean of 120 units/period, accounting for spring demand growth. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for the high variance observed since P7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~120 units/period since Period 7 (Spring seasonality). Lead time remains variable between 1 and 2 periods. Pipeline accounting: 289 units in 'In-transit' (P1 and P3) are effectively zero and should be ignored in inventory math.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019. The product is a denim mini skirt, which enters peak seasonality in late spring/early summer. Demand since Period 7 has averaged 138 units/period (mean of 273, 126, 66, 88, 137), showing higher volatility but a sustained increase from the early season. Regarding supply: Period 1 (168 units) and Period 3 (121 units) orders totaling 289 units are confirmed lost, as they are now 9-11 periods overdue. Consequently, the actual pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 289 (461 - 289 = 172 units). The 172 units in the pipeline correspond to the Period 10 order. The backend OR logic uses full In-transit (461) to calculate orders. To correct for the 289 lost units, I will artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure the base stock (target inventory) accounts for this 'phantom' inventory. Target mu_hat calculation: (L+1) * Expected Demand + Lost Units = (2+1) * 140 + 289 = 709. This ensures the backend places an order if current on-hand (371) + real pipeline (172) is insufficient to cover lead time demand, despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are in a spring demand regime for denim skirts. Average demand since Period 7 is approximately 131 units per week (273, 126, 66, 88, 137, 98). A critical supply chain issue exists: orders from Period 1 (168 units) and Period 3 (121 units) totaling 289 units are confirmed lost, as they are over 9 periods overdue. The current 'In-transit' of 568 units includes these 289 phantom units. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is only 279 units (568 - 289). Current on-hand is 273. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost inventory. Target base stock should cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at ~131 units/period = 393 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline of 568, I must adjust mu_hat upward to compensate: mu_hat_required = Target_Base_Stock + Phantom_Transit. 393 + 289 = 682. This ensures the backend calculates (682 - 568) = 114 units to order, effectively ignoring the lost units while maintaining a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory ghosting: 289 units (P1, P3) remain in 'In-transit' but are lost. Parameters must compensate for this phantom pipeline until it is cleared or ignored by the backend.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688105002' (denim skirt) is in its spring/summer sales peak. Demand over the last 7 periods (P7-P13) has averaged 121 units/period with significant volatility (std dev ~70). The current date is May 13, and on-hand inventory is 212 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 620 units is heavily distorted by 289 'ghost' units from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost. The actual reliable pipeline is 331 units (620 - 289), consisting of orders from P10, P12, and P13. To manage this in the OR backend (which subtracts the full 620 from the base_stock), I must artificially inflate the base_stock by the 'ghost' quantity (289 units). Using L=2 (promised), a demand forecast (1+L)*121 = 363, plus a buffer for volatility and the ghost inventory correction (363 + 289 = 652), I set mu_hat explicitly to ensure sufficient orders are placed despite the backend seeing phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory ghosting correction: Internal math must account for 289 units in 'In-transit' that will never arrive. Demand regime for May remains stable at ~120 units/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the demand for the 'Mini Bea' denim skirt is in a stable spring regime, averaging 91 units/period over the last 5 weeks. The critical operational issue is the systemic 'In-transit' ghosting of 289 units from Period 1 and Period 3, which are clearly lost (overdue by 12+ periods). The current In-transit display is 540 units; however, the 'real' pipeline is only 251 units (540 - 289 lost units). Additionally, we have 238 units on-hand. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate base-stock orders [order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)], it 'sees' 289 units that will never arrive and will therefore under-order. To correct this without the ability to edit the pipeline directly, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to force the backend to target a higher inventory level. Targeting a \u03bc\u0302 equivalent to (1+L) * average_demand + 289/ (1+L) will bridge this gap. With a 2-period promised lead time (L=2), (1+L) = 3. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~273 units. To offset 289 units of ghost inventory, I set mu_hat to 562 (273 + 289). This makes the backend's effective base stock high enough to maintain flow despite the phantom units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for this denim skirt remains stable within a spring/summer regime, averaging approximately 102 units per period over the last 9 periods (P7-P15). The 'In-transit' balance of 540 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory: 289 units from P1 and P3 are permanently lost, and the P13 order (52 units) is now 3 periods deep (1 period overdue based on the promised L=2), and the P14 order (27 units) is 2 periods deep. The total reliable pipeline is 540 - 289 = 251 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from its base stock calculation, I must artificially inflate the mean demand (mu_hat) to force the necessary ordering. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * 102 units. With L=2, target is ~306 units. Available reliable inventory = 152 (on-hand) + 251 (reliable pipeline) = 403. However, the OR engine sees 152 + 540 = 692. To offset the 289 lost units and account for the current 152 on-hand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the engine maintains a safety buffer despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed that P13 order (52 units) is now 1 period past promised lead time; monitoring for further supply instability. Demand regime since P7 remains steady at ~102 units/period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 (June). The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees sustained demand during spring and summer (March\u2013August). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 102 units/period since Period 7 (following the initial spring spike). The supply chain is unreliable: 289 units in 'In-transit' from Period 1 and Period 3 are confirmed lost. Additionally, the Period 13 order (52 units) is now at Period 17 and hasn't arrived (Promise L=2), and the Period 14 order (27 units) is also due but hasn't arrived. Total 'phantom' or severely delayed inventory in the 629-unit pipeline is at least 368 units (289 + 52 + 27). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 'In-transit' count being artificially inflated by lost units, I will set mu_hat to 1100 (explicit) and L to 7 (explicit). This math (Base Stock = mu_hat - In Transit) targets a base stock level of roughly 471 units (1100 - 629), resulting in an order that accounts for the 58 on-hand units and expected demand of ~102/period while effectively ignoring the lost 368 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Total 'ghost' inventory in In-transit increased to 368 units (P1, P3, P13, P14 orders). Parameters must explicitly override pipeline inflation to maintain stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), we face a significant discrepancy between the system's 'In-transit' count (779 units) and the actual reliable pipeline. Based on arrival history, the following orders are confirmed lost or indefinite: P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27). Total ghost inventory = 368 units. The actual reliable pipeline is 779 - 368 = 411 units. Demand since P11 has stabilized at a mean of ~85 units (range 54-137). With June/Summer starting, denim mini skirt demand is likely to remain steady or slightly increase. To ensure the OR backend orders enough units despite the 368-unit phantom pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Expected 3-period demand (L+1) is ~255 units. With 93 on-hand and 411 reliable in-transit, we are well-covered. However, the OR engine sees 779 in-transit. To force an order and maintain stock levels, mu_hat is set explicitly to 480 (covering 3-week demand + ghost inventory buffer). This prevents a stockout caused by the backend assuming the 368 lost units will arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Total ghost inventory remains 368 units (P1: 168, P3: 121, P13: 52, P14: 27) which are severely overdue and unlikely to arrive. Demand regime for June is stable at ~85 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are managing a denim mini skirt. The demand regime over the last 12 periods (since Period 7) has averaged approximately 100 units/period, but more recently (last 3 periods), demand has slowed to an average of 63.6 units/period (54, 43, and the preceding 94). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. The most critical factor is the 'ghost' inventory: orders from P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), and P14 (27) total 368 units in the 'In-transit' figure that are severely overdue and almost certainly lost. With 'In-transit' at 779, subtracting the 368 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 411 (primarily the P17 order of 239). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 368 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand at ~85 units/week = 3 * 85 = 255. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 255 + 368 = 623, the backend math (base_stock - in_transit) will effectively net out the ghost units and maintain adequate stock. Sigma_hat is set to cover moderate volatility during the seasonal tail-end.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). The item is a denim mini skirt, which should be in high season during summer. However, recent demand (P18-P19) has fluctuated (43 vs 112). Historical mean since the Spring shift (P7 onwards) is approx 95 units/period. The key challenge is 'Inventory Ghosting': 'In-transit' shows 779 units, but I must subtract 'ghost' units from lost/overdue shipments to find the true pipeline. Ghost units include: P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27). Total ghost = 368 units. Additionally, the order from P17 (239 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) and should arrive this period or next; it is not yet considered ghost. Effective pipeline = 779 - 368 = 411 units. On-hand is 0. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock shift: base_stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost quantity to bypass the subtraction logic: Target Base Stock = [(3 periods * 95) + 368 ghost] = 653. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value that results in this base stock allows the backend to place an order despite the 779 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Ghost inventory in In-transit remains 368 units (P1, P3, P13, P14). On-hand is depleted (0). Effective pipeline is 411 units. Demand remains volatile but averages ~95 units/period during the summer season.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are facing a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 779 units is misleading due to 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Based on historical data, shipments from P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), and P14 (27) totaling 368 units are significantly overdue and likely lost. The real pipeline consists of the orders placed in P16 (89, already arrived in P17) and P17 (239, expected in P19/P20 but not yet arrived). This suggests that the P17 order (239 units) and any subsequent orders are what we must rely on. Demand has been volatile but shows a summer average of approximately 95 units/period (recent average over last 5 periods is 87, but the last two periods spiked to 112 and 134). To compensate for the 368 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must increase mu_hat significantly. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, I set the target to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 100 = 300) plus the 368 ghost units, totaling 668. This ensures the backend triggers an order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost inventory in In-transit remains 368 units (P1, P3, P13, P14). Summer demand is averaging ~100 units/period (P19-P20 average: 123). Current period starting on-hand is 0.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th, peak summer season for denim skirts. Demand has surged over the last three weeks (112, 134, 139), averaging 128 units/period, compared to the spring average of ~85-100. We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0). There is a critical supply chain issue: 'In-transit' shows 779 units, but a significant portion is 'ghost inventory'. Specifically, orders from P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), and P14 (27) total 368 units that are severely overdue and likely lost. The P17 order of 239 units should have arrived by now (L=2) but hasn't; if it doesn't arrive by next period, it also becomes suspect. Subtracting the confirmed 368 ghost units from 779 leaves a 'real' pipeline of 411 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock as Demand * (L+1) = 130 * 3 = 390. To bypass the 368 phantom units, I must add them to the target: 390 + 368 = 758. I set mu_hat to 758 and use recent demand volatility for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 368 units in In-transit (P1, P3, P13, P14). Summer demand peak confirmed: P19-P21 average is 128 units/period (+50% vs spring).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. We are in a high-demand summer season for denim skirts (P19-P21 demand averaged 128 units). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 887 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), and P14 (27) are lost, totaling 368 ghost units. Furthermore, no arrivals have occurred since P17, despite orders placed in P17 (239) and P22 (108). The P17 order is now 6 periods old, suggesting it is also likely lost or severely delayed. To ensure stock arrives, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the 887 in-transit units. The OR backend calculates 'order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)'. With pipeline at 887, base_stock must exceed this to place any order. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat, I'll set it to 1050 (representing roughly (1+L) * 350 demand) to force the backend to reconcile the inventory gap and target a higher service level during this peak season. L remains 2 as the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply failure escalation: Order from Period 17 (239 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost, increasing total ghost inventory from 368 to 607 units. Total In-transit (887) is ~68% phantom stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, reflecting peak summer demand for denim skirts. Recent demand (P19-P23) has averaged 122 units/period, showing a significant increase from the spring average. The supply chain remains highly unreliable. In-transit inventory is listed as 1189 units, but analysis of history confirms a massive amount of 'ghost' inventory: orders from P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27), and now likely P17 (239) and P18 (0 - actually P17 was the last big missing one) are lost. Specifically, P1, P3, P13, P14, and P17 (totaling 607 units) are severely overdue. To maintain availability, I must bypass this phantom pipeline. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and pipeline is inflated by ~607 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base_stock that forces an order despite the 'ghost' units. I estimate needed coverage for 3 periods (L+1) at ~370 units. To offset the 607 ghost units, I'll set mu_hat to approximately 1000 to ensure the backend places a meaningful order. Lead time remains variable (1-2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory in In-transit reached 607 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17 orders), representing ~51% of current reported pipeline. Summer demand regime confirmed at ~122 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29), we are in a high-demand summer season for denim skirts. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is 120.5 units, which is significantly higher than the spring average (~85-90). Supply chain instability is severe: out of the 1189 units reported in 'In-transit', a combined 607 units from Periods 1, 3, 13, 14, and 17 are considered lost (severely overdue). This means the 'effective pipeline' is only 582 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 607 units that will never arrive but are still subtracted from orders by the OR engine, I must artificially inflate the base stock. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus the 607 lost units. Target base stock = (120 * 3) + 607 = 967. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 967, the OR backend (calculating base stock - pipeline) will effectively offset the 607 phantom units and provide enough stock for actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory in In-transit reached 607 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17 orders), representing ~51% of current reported pipeline. Summer demand regime confirmed at ~120 units/period (P19-P24 average).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 26 (2019/8/5). The SKU is a denim mini skirt, which is highly seasonal for summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Demand from Period 19 to Period 25 averaged 114.8 units/period, showing a sustained summer peak. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' of 1189 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory. Orders from Period 1 (168), Period 3 (121), Period 13 (52), Period 14 (27), and now the bulk order from Period 17 (239) are all significantly overdue (L > 6 vs. promised L=2) and are essentially lost. Total ghost inventory = 168+121+52+27+239 = 607 units. The effective reliable pipeline is 1189 - 607 = 582 units (primarily the P23 order of 410 units). Since on-hand is 0 and recent demand remains strong (~115/period), I must ensure the OR backend places a covering order. To do this while 'In-transit' is inflated, I will increase mu_hat and decrease L in the parameters calculation to force a high base stock that exceeds the 1189 'In-transit' figure, as the capped policy 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)' will subtract the full 1189. I'll set mu_hat to an explicit value based on (1+L)*120 plus the 607 ghost units to neutralize the pipeline inflation.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (Period 27). The product is a denim mini skirt, which typically sees strong demand in summer, but we are entering the tail end of the high season. Recent demand (P24-P26: 111, 81, 60) shows a cooling trend, likely as back-to-school season approaches or the core summer peak fades. The 'In-transit' figure of 779 units is misleading due to 'ghost inventory'. Confirming history: P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27), and P17 (239) are all lost/severely overdue, totaling 607 units. Therefore, the true reliable pipeline is 779 - 607 = 172 units. These 172 units represent an order placed between P24-P26 that hasn't arrived yet (actually, history shows zero orders were placed in P24-25, so this 172 must be from a very late order or a misunderstanding of the systemic 'In-transit' count; however, the backend math must be manipulated to ignore the 607 ghost units). To force the backend to place an order despite the 779 in-transit units, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate demand for the next (L+1) periods (3 periods) to be ~240 units (80/week), but because the backend subtracts the full 779 from the base stock, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Target Base Stock + 607 ghost units) to ensure replenishment occurs. Target Base Stock ~ 400. 400 + 607 = 1007. I will set mu_hat to 1007 and keep L=2.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory in In-transit remains 607 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17). Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. Late-summer demand decline observed (P26 demand 60 vs P21 139).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand for this denim skirt has declined from its summer peak (~120 units/period) to a lower late-summer regime (P26: 60, P27: 57). I estimate current demand at ~60 units/period. The In-transit pipeline of 779 units remains heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27), and P17 (239), totaling 607 units. These orders are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods and the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 772 (on-hand 293 + in-transit 779) - 607 = 165 units. With on-hand inventory at 293, even without new orders, we have about 4-5 periods of stock at the new lower demand rate. I will set mu_hat to reflect the lower demand (recent_N=3) and L to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (1-3 periods). Because the 'ghost' inventory leads the OR backend to believe the pipeline is 607 units higher than reality, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a higher base stock that prevents the backend from zeroing out orders due to phantom supply, though currently, on-hand is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Late-summer demand (August) dropped to ~60 units/period from summer peak of ~120. Total ghost inventory in In-transit stabilized at 607 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for this denim mini skirt has shifted from a summer peak of ~120 units/period to a late-summer/early-fall regime of ~62 units/period (based on P26-P28 demand: 60, 57, 68). The inventory system continues to carry 607 units of 'ghost' inventory in the In-transit pipeline (P1: 168, P3: 121, P13: 52, P14: 27, P17: 239) which are severely overdue and will not arrive. This phantom stock significantly inflates the backend's perception of available supply. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. My base stock target is (L+1) * average_demand. With L assumed at 2 and recent demand at 62, the required coverage is ~186 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 'ghost' 607 units from its order calculation, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure it places an order when needed. Currently, on-hand is 225, which is sufficient for ~3.6 weeks of demand at the new lower rate. I will set mu_hat to 186 to reflect the actual demand regime, acknowledging that no new order will be triggered until on-hand + (real) in-transit drops below this level. I use 'explicit' to bypass standard calculations that would be skewed by historical summer peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Late-summer demand (August) dropped to ~62 units/period (P26-P28) from summer peak of ~120. Total ghost inventory in In-transit stabilized at 607 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for this denim skirt follows a seasonal pattern: a spring peak (~120 units), a summer peak (~130 units), and a significant late-summer decline starting in August. For the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has averaged 55.5 units (60, 57, 68, 37). The current 'In-transit' figure of 779 units contains 607 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P17) that are severely overdue and confirmed lost based on game history. Subtracting these from the total leaves a reliable pipeline of 172 units. With 188 units on-hand, the total reliable stock is 360 units. Given the declining demand regime (mu_hat target ~55-60) and the 3-period coverage window (L+1), the current stock of 360 units is more than sufficient. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current late-summer/early-autumn demand level and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. L is kept at default as the OR backend needs to maintain the review cycle, even though actual lead times vary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed for late summer: avg demand Period 26-29 is ~56 units/period compared to ~120 in July. Ghost inventory remains constant at 607 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for the denim skirt has stabilized in a late-summer/early-autumn low, with the last five periods (P26-P30) averaging approximately 52 units per period (60, 57, 68, 37, 37). There is a significant 'ghost inventory' of 607 units in the In-transit column (from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P17) that are long overdue and will not arrive. Currently, on-hand inventory is 151 units, which is enough to cover nearly 3 weeks of the current demand regime (~52 units/week). Because the backend OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (779 units) from the calculated base stock, it will not place any orders. To prevent stockouts once the 151 units are depleted, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current lower demand regime, and using 'explicit' for L to force the backend to consider a 3-period lead time, reflecting recent delivery volatility (P23 arrived in 3 periods). The high pipeline will still likely suppress ordering until on-hand is lower, which is efficient given the holding cost vs. current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for September established at ~52 units/period (P26-P30 average), marking a significant seasonal decline from summer peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for the 'Skirt Mini Bea' has entered a late-summer/autumn low, with current demand stabilization around 40-50 units per period (average of the last 6 periods is ~48). There is a significant 'ghost' inventory in In-transit totaling 607 units (orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P17) which are long overdue and must be discounted. The backend observes 779 units In-transit, meaning the 'true' pipeline is only 172 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 114 units, which is sufficient for ~2.5 periods of the current demand regime. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 607 ghost units as available supply and prematurely stopping orders, I will use 'explicit' values for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set L to 2 (promised). I set mu_hat to 150 (calculated as (1+L) * 50 units/period) to reflect the current lower demand regime. I set sigma_hat to 35 to provide a buffer for the observed volatility in this lower regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized at ~48 units/period (P26-P31). Ghost inventory remains 607 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17). True pipeline is In-transit minus 607.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for the denim skirt has stabilized in a low-seasonal regime (September average is ~36 units/period). On-hand inventory is 82 units, which covers more than 2 periods of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 779 is heavily inflated by 607 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17) that are long overdue and confirmed lost. The true reliable pipeline is 172 units (Total 779 - Ghost 607). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or adjust the pipeline expectation. Given on-hand (82) + true pipeline (172) = 254 units, and expected demand over (L+1) periods (3 * 36 = 108), the system technically has enough stock if the recent orders arrive. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the core of the low-demand regime since early August (Period 26) to avoid overstocking while holding costs are $1/unit.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized at ~36 units/period (P29-P32), significantly lower than previous estimates. Ghost inventory remains 607 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34 (late September), we observe a sustained demand regime shift. Over the last 8 periods (P26-P33), average demand has dropped to 51.5 units/period, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~120 units. The most recent demand of 90 in P33 appears to be a minor fluctuation or final seasonal clearing rather than a trend reversal, as the overall trajectory for a denim mini skirt moving into October is downward. Managing the 'ghost' inventory remains the priority. The system reports 779 units in-transit, but 607 units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory. Thus, the real pipeline is only 172 units. Currently, on-hand is 0. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive (but fake) surplus of 779 units and stopping all orders, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat that incorporate the ghost inventory into the safety stock calculation. Specifically, I set mu_hat based on the recent 8-period average demand (~52 units) multiplied by (1+L), and then add the ghost inventory value (607) to 'trick' the backend into maintaining a real base stock that accounts for the fact that ~78% of its perceived pipeline doesn't exist. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (1-3 periods) observed in actually delivered shipments.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime averaged 51.5 units/period (P26-P33), confirming seasonal decline for denim skirts. Ghost inventory in In-transit remains constant at 607 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. Demand for this denim skirt SKU has seasonally declined and stabilized. For the period P26-P34, the average demand is 51.7 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 17 units. Ghost inventory in In-transit remains a critical issue: 607 units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17) are confirmed lost/severely overdue. Total In-transit is 821, but after subtracting the 607 ghost units, the true reliable pipeline is only 214 units (the P34 order was 42 units; we continue to track the remaining gap). Since on-hand is 0, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover for (L+1) periods of demand. I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the recent 9-period regime (P26-P34) which captures the lower autumn demand level, and sigma_hat explicitly to provide a safety buffer against the recent volatility (e.g., the P33 spike to 90). The L=2 setting combined with the updated mu_hat will help the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime while ignoring the phantom pipeline logic internally by requesting a higher stock target via mu_hat.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in a low-demand phase for denim skirts, with demand averaging approximately 45-50 units/period over the last 10 periods (P26-P35). The 'In-transit' count of 821 units is highly misleading due to substantial 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27), and P17 (239) are severely overdue and almost certainly lost. This totals 607 units of phantom stock. The true reliable pipeline is 821 - 607 = 214 units. Currently, on-hand is 0, meaning we are relying on these 214 units to arrive. Since the OR engine uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will see 821 units and likely refuse to order more, even though most of those units don't exist. To force the OR backend to place an order to cover the current demand regime (~50 units/period) while accounting for the ~3 period lead time (L+1=4), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 50/week and a safety buffer. Setting mu_hat to 800 and sigma_hat to 150 will provide a base stock high enough to exceed the 821 phantom units and trigger a replenishment order to meet actual customer demand during this period of stockout.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand for 'Skirt Mini Bea' has stabilized into a late-autumn regime, with an average of 45.4 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P32-P36). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported In-transit is 1047 units, but this is heavily distorted by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Based on historical data, shipments from P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27), and P17 (239) totalling 607 units are more than 15 periods overdue and effectively lost. Furthermore, orders from P34 (42) and P36 (226) are within the normal lead-time window. The true reliable pipeline is 1047 - 607 = 440 units, which is still quite high relative to the current low demand regime of ~45 units/period. The OR backend needs to recognize that the pipeline is inflated by these 'ghost' units. To prevent the OR engine from stopping all orders due to the high (but fake) pipeline, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised lead time) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current low-demand segment while monitoring for any late-season changes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Oct remains steady at ~45 units/period (P32-P36). Total ghost inventory in In-transit remains 607 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for the denim mini skirt has stabilized at a late-autumn level. Over the last 12 periods (P26-P37), average demand is 56.3 units, but the last 5 periods (P33-P37) average 58.6 units. The product is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' balance of 1047 units contains 607 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17) which have not arrived for 20+ periods and are considered lost. The true reliable pipeline is 1047 - 607 = 440 units (orders from P34 and P36). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline), it will assume we have 1047 units coming and stop ordering. To force an order and maintain availability, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 607 phantom units. Required base stock for a (L+1) horizon (L=2) at ~60 units/period is ~180. To counteract the -607 pipeline deficit, I set mu_hat to 180 + 607 = 787. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - 1047) results in a positive order value to cover upcoming demand while on-hand is zero.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the product (Ladies Denim Mini Skirt) is entering the winter season where demand for short denim skirts typically remains low. Recent demand (P34-P38) averages ~55 units/period. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the reporting shows 1047 units 'In-transit'. However, history confirms 607 units are 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17) and will never arrive. This leaves an effective pipeline of 440 units (orders from P34 and P36). The P34 order (42 units) is now 5 periods old\u2014given historical lead times fluctuate between 1-3 periods, this order is also likely lost. The P36 order (226 units) is 3 periods old and should have arrived; its absence suggests further supply instability. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'In-transit' bloat, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the reported pipeline (base_stock calculation: mu_hat + z*sigma). Since the backend subtracts the full 1047 units, and we need to cover ~150 units (3 periods of demand) while on-hand is 0, mu_hat must be set very high to trigger a replenishment order. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom pipeline and current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply failure escalation: P34 order (42 units) now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total ghost inventory in In-transit increased to 649 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P34).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, the product (denim skirt) is in a late-autumn/winter period where demand has stabilized at a lower level (~53 units/period over the last 5 weeks). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with significant 'ghost inventory' in the In-transit pipeline. Specifically, orders from P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27), P17 (239), and P34 (42) are severely overdue and considered lost, totaling 649 units. This ghost inventory inflates the pipeline, misleading the OR backend into under-ordering. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the desired inventory level plus the ghost inventory (649 units). With a targeted base stock of (1+L)*demand + safety, and L=2, demand=53, base stock should be ~160. To offset the 649 ghost units, I set mu_hat (which the OR engine uses for base stock calculation) to roughly 810. This ensures the calculation 'final order = base_stock - (actual_pipeline + ghost_pipeline)' results in a replenishment that ignores the 649 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total ghost inventory remains 649 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P34). Demand regime for Nov is stable at ~55 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for this denim skirt has stabilized in a late-autumn regime, averaging approximately 52 units per period over the last 15 periods (P26-P40), with the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging 52 units. Ghost inventory in the In-transit pipeline remains a significant issue. Specifically, 649 units from orders P1 (168), P3 (121), P13 (52), P14 (27), P17 (239), and P34 (42) are severely overdue and considered lost. The reported 'In-transit' is 1026 units, but the true reliable pipeline is 1026 - 649 = 377 units (consisting of the P39 order of 205 units and potentially other recent backend adjustments). With 139 units on hand and a forecast of ~52 units/period, the objective is to maintain inventory through the end of the year without over-ordering as the game concludes in Period 47. I will use recent_N (N=15) for demand to capture the stable autumn regime and use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend subtracts the phantom 649 units from its 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation. Specifically, if the desired base stock is B, the OR engine calculates (B - 1026). To effectively force the engine to use (B - 377), I must increase mu_hat by 649. Expected demand over (L+1=3) periods is 52 * 3 = 156. Adjusted mu_hat = 156 + 649 = 805.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-25. We are entering late November/December. Historical demand for this denim skirt has declined significantly from summer peaks (~120 units) to a stable late-autumn regime. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand averaged 49.2 units per period (55, 71, 52, 35, 33). The most recent two periods (35, 33) suggest a further tapering as winter approaches. Lead times remain variable (observed 2 and 3 periods recently). Inventory status: On-hand is 311 units. In-transit is 821 units, but 649 units of this is 'ghost inventory' (effectively lost orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, and P34). Therefore, the 'true' pipeline is 821 - 649 = 172 units. Total effective inventory (on-hand + true pipeline) is 483 units. With demand around 40-50 units per period, 483 units covers approximately 10 weeks, which is well above the (L+1) requirement. No new order is needed. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current ~50 unit regime, and sigma_hat similarly to capture recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total ghost inventory remains 649 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P34). Demand continues to taper into late November, averaging ~49 units over the last 5 periods and ~34 over the last 2.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering December, where demand for mini denim skirts might see holiday-related volatility. The recent Period 42 saw a significant demand spike to 144 units, contrasting with the previous four-period average of ~38. This could indicate the start of a holiday surge or an outlier. The ghost inventory in 'In-transit' remains a critical factor: 649 units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, and P34) are confirmed lost. Total reported In-transit is 821, meaning the 'true' pipeline is only 172 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 167 units. To avoid over-ordering due to the recent spike while ensuring availability for potential December demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend while moderating the extreme P42 value. I will explicitly set L=2 as the backend's promised lead time is generally reliable for non-lost orders. Sigma_hat is set to default to allow the backend to handle the high variance observed in P42. The ghost inventory will continue to be managed by the OR engine's logic, but my mu_hat selection aims to maintain a safe stock level without over-committing to the recent outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 144 units in P42 (Dec 1st week) vs previous 4-week average of 38 suggests early holiday seasonality. Ghost inventory remains constant at 649 units lost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand for Period 42 spiked to 144 (first week of December), but fell back to 38 in Period 43. This likely indicates early holiday purchasing for a 'denim skirt', but the sudden drop suggests the spike might not be sustained weekly. Historically, 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P34) totals 649 units. Actual In-transit is reported as 821, meaning the reliable pipeline is only 172 units. Currently, on-hand is 129. Summing 129 + 172 (reliable pipeline) gives 301 units. I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 periods (P41-P43) which averages 72 units/period to account for the seasonal bump while acknowledging the volatility. This leads to a mu_hat of (1+L)*72. Since the OR backend uses the inflated In-transit (821) when calculating orders, I must use mu_hat to 'trick' it into ordering by setting mu_hat high enough to overcome the 649 ghost units or by setting a high enough target; however, the capped policy might limit results. To ensure we have stock for the final 4 periods, I will explicitly set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the Dec 1st spike and the possibility of a late Dec surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Final confirmation of ghost inventory totaling 649 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P34). Reliability of 'In-transit' metric is approx 21%. Demand volatility in Dec (144 then 38) suggests holiday spikes for denim wear.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (mid-December), the demand for this denim mini skirt is showing expected holiday volatility. After a significant spike to 144 in P42 (late Nov/early Dec), demand returned to 38 and 57. The current on-hand inventory is 72. The pipeline management remains the primary challenge: the 'In-transit' of 821 contains 649 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P34) that are significantly overdue and likely lost. The true effective pipeline consists of more recent orders, leaving the backend's internal logic vulnerable to under-ordering due to perceived high pipeline stock. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent holiday demand (averaging 80 units over the last 3 periods) and set a higher L (explicitly 3) to allow the OR engine's base stock calculation to reach a higher target, compensating for the 649 units of phantom inventory it incorrectly subtracts from its order quantity.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. Demand in the last few periods (P43-P45) has been consistent around 50-60 units (57, 58, 38). Earlier in December (P42), there was a spike to 144 units. We are likely in a year-end/holiday demand regime. Ghost inventory remains at 649 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P34), meaning the 'true' pipeline from the reported 821 units is only 172 units. Currently, on-hand is 14. If we don't adjust parameters, the backend will think we have 835 units (14 + 821) and will not order. To force an order and maintain stock for the upcoming weeks, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the ghost inventory in the backend's base stock calculation [base_stock = (1+L)*demand + safety]. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the OR engine subtracts pipeline (821) from this, I need mu_hat to be large enough to offset that 649-unit phantom. Average demand is ~55. With L=2, (1+L)*demand = 165. To overcome the 649 phantom units and ensure an order is placed, mu_hat must be set to approximately 165 + 649 = 814. I will set it to 850 to ensure adequate coverage.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '688105002' (Ladies Denim Skirt) is entering the end-of-year/early January period. Demand has transitioned from a holiday spike (144 units in P42) back to a stable winter regime of ~45-50 units per period (P43-P46 average: 47.75). The current 'In-transit' figure of 965 units is heavily distorted by historical supply failures. I have identified 649 units as 'ghost' inventory from orders in periods P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, and P34 that never arrived and are long overdue. Consequently, the true reliable pipeline is 316 units (965 total - 649 ghost). This 316 includes the P46 order of 144 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0, the current reliable pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 6 periods of demand at the recent average rate (316 / 48 \u2248 6.5). I will set L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed successful lead time, while mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the recent stable demand of the last 5 periods (P42-P46) to ensure the OR backend does not over-order due to the phantom inventory or the outlier holiday spike.
