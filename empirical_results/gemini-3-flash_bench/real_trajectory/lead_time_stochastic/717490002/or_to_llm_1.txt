Looking at historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), it is very stable, ranging between 35 and 42 units with an average of 39.4 units per period. We are currently in Period 1 (2019-02-11) with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Our inventory needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand to prevent stockouts while the first order is in transit. Expected demand for 3 periods is approximately 118 units. The OR baseline recommends 45 units based on a capped single-period estimation. However, since we start at 0 inventory and need to fill the pipeline to cover the 2-period lead time plus the current period's demand, the OR recommendation is insufficient for the initial startup phase.

  "rationale": "1. **Lead Time Analysis**: The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 120 units placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. There are no concluded orders yet, so I assume the promised lead time holds.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical samples show demand ranging from 35 to 42 (avg ~39). Period 1 actual demand was 32. This SKU is a basic 'Jersey Basic' T-shirt, which typically has stable demand unless affected by seasonality. Given the date (mid-February), we are approaching spring, but no major immediate spike is expected this week.\n3. **Inventory Position**: I have 0 on-hand and 120 in-transit. In-transit covers approximately 3 periods of demand (~39 * 3 = 117). However, I am currently stocked out (0 sold in Period 1 due to 0 on-hand). The 120 units arriving in Period 3 will address the current shortage.\n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation of 6 units is very low. This is likely because the OR agent's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation (120 units) nearly satisfies its calculated base-stock level. Since lead time is 2, I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (3 periods). Total required = 3 * 39 = 117. With 120 in transit, I am technically covered for the immediate lead-time window. However, OR's cap is very restrictive.\n5. **Adjustment**: I will increase the order slightly above the OR recommendation to 15. This provides a small buffer while waiting for the large P1 shipment to arrive, ensuring that once the pipeline begins to flow, I don't face immediate stockouts if demand trends back toward the historical average of 40+.",

Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales (sold=0 for demand=32 and 51) because the initial stock was 0. The OR recommendation is only 3 units because it sees a large pipeline (135 units) relative to its calculated base stock. However, since we have been stocking out and demand is slightly higher than the historical mean (51 in P2), I will slightly increase the order to ensure we don't fall behind if demand stays elevated or if lead times slip, while remaining cautious of the large incoming shipment of 120 units which should cover roughly 3 periods of demand once it arrives.",

If L=2, it arrives during P3 and is visible in 'P3 conclude'. \n- Looking at 'Period 3 conclude', arrived=0. This suggests lead time may be longer than 2 periods OR the shipment is slightly delayed. \n- However, it's too early to confirm a permanent shift to L=3. \n\nDemand Analysis: Historical samples (35-42) were lower than actual realization in P2 (51) and P3 (61). We are seeing a clear upward trend (+45% over P1). \n\nInventory Analysis: \n- On-hand: 0. \n- In-transit: 150 (P1: 120, P2: 15, P3: 15). \n- We have suffered 144 units of lost sales (demand with 0 inventory). \n\nOR Recommendation: The OR proposes only 5 units because it sees 150 units in the pipeline against a calculated base-stock.

These consist of the Period 1 order (120 units), Period 3 order (15 units), and Period 4 order (45 units). Following the lead time of 2, the Period 1 order (120 units) is technically overdue (should have arrived in Period 3). This suggests a potential lost or significantly delayed shipment. However, the Period 3 order (15 units) is expected to arrive in the current Period 5, and the Period 4 order (45 units) in Period 6. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (42, 40, 35, 42, 38) and game history (32, 51, 61, 47) show an average demand of approximately 43 units per period. The product is a 'Jersey Basic T-shirt', which typically has stable demand, but we are entering Spring (March), which usually sees a slight uptick in apparel demand. 4. OR Strategy & Adjustment: The OR agent recommends 0 units because it counts the 120-unit 'zombie' order from Period 1 as valid pipeline inventory. If we assume the 120 units are lost, our pipeline for the (L+1) horizon (Periods 5, 6, and 7) is only 60 units (15 arriving now + 45 arriving next period).

The SKU is a 'Cat Tee' / 'T-shirt in soft jersey,' and we are entering late March (Spring). Demand is likely shifting to a higher regime (~60-70 units/period) due to seasonal warming. 3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit = 225 units (P3: 15, P4: 45, P6: 45, P5: 75 - but P5 arrived last period, so remaining IT = P3: 15, P4: 45, P6: 45 = 105).

The demand has shifted from a historical average (~40) to a much higher Spring regime (P7: 150, P8: 118). This validates the 'Spring demand surge' recorded in insights.

Excluding lost units, effective in-transit is only 120. The OR recommendation is 0 because it incorrectly counts 300 units in the pipeline and uses lower historical demand (\u03bc\u0304 \u2248 52). \n4. Strategy: To cover demand for P9, P10, and P11 (L+1), we need approximately 360-450 units. Currently, we have 17 on-hand and 120 reliable units in-transit (P8 order), leaving a gap of 220-310 units.

Recent demand (P7: 150, P8: 118, P9: 64) has significantly exceeded the early-season mean. The dip to 64 in P9 may be a fluctuations or due to stockouts early in the period (sold out of 17 on-hand units). Given the mid-April date (2019/04/15), Spring demand is in full swing. Following the confirm demand shift from Period 8, I estimate demand around 100-110 units/week.\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 0.

Excluding the 180 lost units, the effective pipeline is 255 units. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely counts the 180 lost units as 'in-transit' and uses a low historical mean.

The current 'In-Transit' of 240 units consists of the P10 order (60 units) and the 180 lost units. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is only 60 units. 2. Demand Analysis: We are in the Spring demand regime for T-shirts (Late April). While periods 9 and 10 saw a dip (64, 66) compared to the spike in P7/P8 (150, 118), the average reflects a clear shift from the initial 40s to a higher range.

Subtracting the 180 lost units confirmed in previous carry-over insights, the 'true' pipeline is 160 units (expected to arrive in P12 and P13). 2. **Demand Analysis**: We are in Late April (Spring/Summer transition). While demand peaked around P7-P8 (~130 units/avg), it has stabilized over the last three periods (P9-P11) at an average of 68.6 units. 3. **Inventory Position**: Target stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1) based on a demand of ~70 units/week is roughly 210-240 units. Current reliable inventory (On-hand 113 + true pipeline 160) equals 273 units. 4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR agent recommends 0 units because it likely overcounts 'zombie' pipeline units (the 180 lost units) and sees the current high inventory relative to total historical demand. 5. **Strategy**: Although my true inventory position (273) covers the next 3 weeks of demand (~210 units) with a safety buffer, the loss of orders remains a risk.

Removing the lost 180 units leaves a realistic pipeline of 282 units. 2. **Demand Analysis**: Item is a Cat Tee (Jersey Basic), highly relevant for June (high summer demand).

Demand for the lead-time window (L+1 = 3 periods) is expected to be ~300 units (3 * 100) to account for summer seasonality. 4. **OR Recommendation Override**: OR recommends 0, likely because it includes lost/dead pipeline stock in its calculation and uses older, lower demand averages.

The average demand over the last 4 observed periods (P14-P17) is approximately 77 units/period. Pipeline inventory is 380 units. However, looking at the history, orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Recent orders (P13, P15, P16) have arrived. Therefore, the current 'In-transit' of 380 likely includes the old lost units (120+15+15+60=210 approx, plus P17's 80 and the leftover of P13/others). 3. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 0 units because its pipeline calculation likely includes the dead/lost orders, making it think the stock position is too high. 4. Strategy: Total visibility (OH + high-probability IT) including P17's order (80) is 78 + 80 = 158. This covers roughly 2 periods of demand (77 * 2 = 154).

However, historical performance shows significant shipment losses early in the sequence (Periods 1, 3, and 4) which were never accounted for, and currently, there is a clear pattern of arrivals taking 1-2 periods. Analyzing the pipeline: we have orders from Period 17 (80 units) and Period 18 (80 units) that are within the expected 2-period lead time window. Any remaining volume from the 460 'In-transit' units is significantly overdue (at least 5+ periods) and should be treated as lost. Current on-hand is only 6 units, and demand has averaged 88 units over the last 4 periods (108, 84, 72, plus recent spikes). Following the OR's recommendation of 0 would result in a stockout within the current period. To maintain availability, I need to cover demand for the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Assuming demand averages ~80 units, we need 240 units available. Pipeline (P17 + P18) is 160 plus 6 on hand = 166 units.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P16-P19) has averaged 91 units/week, maintaining the high-demand 'Spring/Summer' regime identified in carry-over insights.

However, P1, P3, P4, and P17 (order placed 5 periods ago) are confirmed lost or significantly delayed, indicating severe pipeline unreliability. 2. Demand Analysis: Demand has just spiked dramatically to 393 units in Period 21. While the historical average was ~40-60, and a Spring shift raised it to ~100, a move to nearly 400 suggests a peak summer event or major clearance demand. 3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit shows 680 units, but if we subtract the likely lost P17 (80 units) and the extremely high-risk older orders (180 units from P1-4), the 'true' pipeline is approximately 420 units (P19, P20, P21). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because it counts all 680 units in-transit against a base-stock level calculated on outdated historical demand. 5. Decision: Given the sudden jump to ~400 units/period and the unreliability of the pipeline, ordering 0 is extremely risky. I will order 120 units to maintain a buffer and hedge against further lost shipments, acknowledging that if all in-transit units arrive, holding costs will increase, but the high profit ($19) vs. low holding cost ($1) favors stock availability during a high-demand peak.",

These 270 units likely correspond to orders from P30 and P31 (which arrived in P32) and the open orders from P32 (120 units) and potentially recent older orders. \n\nDemand Analysis: Recent demand shows a sustained summer/early autumn regime averaging ~150-160 units per period, with occasional spikes over 200. Period 32 demand was 103, but P29 and P30 saw 193 and 223 respectively. \n\nStrategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it treats the entire 940 units as valid pipeline inventory. Adjusting for the ~670 lost units, the true inventory position (On-hand 137 + Functional Pipeline ~270) is around 407 units. To cover the lead time (2 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods) at an average demand of 150, we need approx 450 units.

{
  "rationale": "The SKU '717490002' (Cat Tee) is currently in a lower-demand autumn/winter regime compared to its summer peak. In Period 41, demand spiked to 110 units, likely due to pre-Black Friday promotions or early holiday shopping, given the date (Nov 18). However, previous weeks (P37-40) averaged ~51 units/period. Current on-hand inventory is 113 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 970 units is highly misleading; as established in the Carry-Over Insights, approximately 790-820 of these units are 'ghost' units from lost orders (P1, 3, 4, 17, 19, 24, 26, 29, and likely P34 which is now 7 periods overdue). The effective pipeline is near zero as no orders were placed in P37-41. While the OR recommendation is 0, the sudden jump in demand to 110 units against an inventory of 113 creates a stockout risk for the upcoming week (Period 42) and subsequent periods, especially with the Black Friday/Cyber Monday week approaching (Nov 25-Dec 2).

Historical demand analysis shows a significant surge starting in late November: Period 41 demand was 110 and Period 42 was 162. This aligns with holiday shopping trends. Current on-hand inventory is 0. While 'In-transit' shows 1070 units, historical tracking confirms that approximately 940 of those units are 'ghost' units from periods 1, 3, 4, 17, 19, 24, 26, 29, and 34 that never arrived and are considered lost. The only reliable in-transit order is the 100 units from Period 42, which is expected to arrive in Period 44 (assuming L=2). The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely based on the inflated in-transit figure and does not account for the confirmed lost shipments or the recent holiday demand spike.

Historically, this item has seen demand spikes in late spring and autumn, but also saw a significant spike in Period 42 (Nov 25) which likely corresponds to holiday sales. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 1250 units is highly misleading; based on history, approximately 940 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Effectively, only the orders from P42 (100 units) and P43 (180 units) are viable pipeline and expected to arrive in P44/P45 given the 1-3 period actual lead time. The OR recommends 0 because it likely miscalculates the pipeline using the 1250 units figure. With demand hitting 162 in late November and 42 in the most recent period, I expect baseline demand around 50-80 units, with potential for another holiday surge. I will order 100 units to maintain stock levels, as the current pipeline (280 units) only covers 2-3 periods of demand and arrival reliability is poor.",

The only viable pipeline units are from P42 (100), P43 (180), and P44 (100), totaling 380 functional units. Demand Analysis: We are in December. Recent demand shows high volatility (P41: 110, P42: 162) followed by a sharp drop in early December (P43: 42, P44: 34). This pattern suggests a pre-holiday surge followed by a lull, but a possible late-December 'Christmas/Post-Christmas' spike in the remaining 3 periods of the game should be anticipated. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it likely sees the massive (though ghosted) pipeline or the recent low demand. To avoid ending the game with a stockout if a late-December spike occurs, I need to ensure the functional pipeline (380 units) covers projected demand. Given the current 0 on-hand, an arrival is desperately needed. The P42 order (100 units) is expected to arrive during P45 (actual lead time often 3 periods).

The functional pipeline consists of the P44 order (100 units) and the P45 order (80 units). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been relatively low (34-51 units) following a late November spike, but we are entering the Christmas/New Year week (Dec 23). While T-shirts are typically seasonal to summer, holiday gifting or travel often creates a secondary spike in late December. Current total functional inventory (On-hand 229 + Functional Pipeline 180 = 409 units) is sufficient to cover about 4-6 periods of current average demand (~70 units) or 2-3 periods of high demand. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 units due to the high reported (but mostly ghosted) in-transit quantity. Given the current on-hand position is healthy for the immediate holiday period and there are 180 functional units arriving soon, I will place a small order of 50 units to maintain a steady flow and buffer against the persistent risk of further shipment losses.",
