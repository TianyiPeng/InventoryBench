Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 554450036 (Skinny Denim TRS). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 57.4 units (71, 60, 46, 48, 62). The product is a staple denim item (superstretch washed skinny jeans). Being mid-February, we are transitioning from winter into the spring season, where demand for core denim typically remains stable or increases slightly. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Our inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. To establish an initial stock position, I will use the mean of the available historical samples (57.4) and the promised lead time (L=2). The base stock calculation for the OR backend will cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to account for current demand resolution plus the lead time. mu_hat will be set using the 'default' method (all 5 samples), and L will use the 'default' promised lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we ordered 75 units, but since the promised lead time is 2, those units are correctly in-transit and not yet arrived. The demand in P1 was 75, which matched exactly our initial stockout (starting on-hand 0). Historically (Jan-Feb), demand has averaged 57.4 units (71, 60, 46, 48, 62). However, P1 demand was 75, suggesting a potential uptick as we move deeper into February. For 'mu_hat', I will use the last 6 samples (including P1) to capture this recent increase. Given L=2, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+2)*mean of samples. For sigma_hat, I'll use the recent 6 samples to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' stays at default (2) as we have no evidence yet of deviation from the promised timing.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is superstretch denim trousers, a fashion staple. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 57.8 units/week (71, 60, 46, 48, 62). In the first two played periods (P1, P2), demand was 75 and 60, respectively, showing strong interest despite zero sales due to 0 starting on-hand inventory. Two orders were placed: 75 units in P1 and 80 units in P2 (Total 155 in-transit). Promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P4. We are currently out of stock. L=2 is used as promised. mu_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 (all historical samples) to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand: ~57.8 * 3 = 173.4. sigma_hat uses historical variance.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is skinny denim trousers with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (75 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', and the status shows 'In-transit: 209' (75+80+54). This indicates that the P1 order is delayed or the transition period hasn't resolved as expected. Historically, demand over the last 5 pre-game weeks and 3 game weeks has been consistent (mean ~59, std ~11). Current on-hand is 0, having missed 207 units of demand due to zero stock. I will use 'recent_N' for demand and lead time calculation to account for recent performance, but maintain the promised lead time 'L' as 'default' for now until a sustained shift to a 3-period lead time is confirmed by an arrival. Mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are managing Julia RW Skinny Denim. Historical demand samples (71, 60, 46, 48, 62) and recent observed demand (75, 60, 72, 49) suggest a mean demand of approximately 60.5 units per period. In Period 4, we received the order from Period 2 (80 units) with a lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The order from Period 1 (75 units) is now overdue (should have arrived in Period 3 or 4); it is likely lost, so I will treat the current pipeline of 136 units as consisting of P3(54), P4(7), and whatever is ordered now. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=max(min(detected_regime, 20), 3)) to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the recent variability. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent standard deviation. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the confirmed lead time of 2 periods from the P2 delivery.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450036' (Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a stockout at Period 6 with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand samples over the last 10 periods (including historical pre-game data) are: 71, 60, 46, 48, 62, 75, 60, 72, 49, 49. The mean demand is approximately 59.2 units per period. The promised lead time is 2. I observed Period 2's order (80 units) arriving in Period 4, confirming an actual lead time of 2. However, Period 1's order (75 units) has not arrived after 5 periods (ordered P1, currently start of P6, expected P3), suggesting it is lost. Period 3's order (54 units) was expected in Period 5 but did not conclude; I will monitor it. Currently, 'in-transit' is 190 (likely P1: 75, P3: 54, P4: 7, P5: 54). Since P1 appears lost, the functional pipeline is 115. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent slight downward trend (avg 61) and use the default lead time of 2. This ensures the base stock calculation covers (2+1) periods of demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple item. We have 12 units on-hand and 165 units in-transit. Looking at the history: Period 1's order (75 units) is still missing (overdue). Period 2 arrived in 2 periods. Period 3 is missing. Period 4 is missing. Period 5 arrived in 1 period. This indicates high lead-time variability and potential lost shipments (Period 1, 3, 4 are late/lost). Current demand samples (71, 60, 46, 48, 62, 75, 60, 72, 49, 49, 42) show a mean of 57.6. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly lower demand seen since March (average ~46), which corresponds to (1+L) periods. For L, although the promised lead time is 2, the inconsistency suggests setting L=2 (default) but monitoring the pipeline. The OR backend will order based on base_stock - pipeline. Since we have a high pipeline (165) due to missing orders, the cap/logic might restrict orders, which is appropriate until we confirm if the missing units are lost or just delayed. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-February stabilization.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. Demand analysis: historical samples show a mean of ~57 units per week (pre-game: 71, 60, 46, 48, 62; game history: 75, 60, 72, 49, 49, 42, 43). Recent demand (last 4 periods) is lower at ~46 units, suggesting a slight downward shift or stabilization following early peaks. Lead-time reconciliation: Promised L=2. Observations: Period 2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). Period 5 order arrived in P6 (L=1). Orders from Period 1 (75 units), Period 3 (54 units), Period 4 (7 units), Period 6 (29 units), and Period 7 (20 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 185). The P1 and P3 orders are significantly overdue (P1 is 7 periods old, P3 is 5 periods old), suggesting these shipments are lost. Excluding lost shipments, valid Pipeline Inventory is 29 (P6) + 20 (P7) = 49 units. On-hand is 0. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~45-50 range) and default calculate for L, but mu_hat will be set via recent_N to reflect the stabilization in demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019/4/08) for skinny denim trousers. Historical demand mean is approx 58 units/period, with a recent spike to 70 in P8. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability (P2 order took 2, P5 took 1, P6 took 2, P7 took 1). Critically, the Period 1 order (75 units) and Period 3 order (54 units) are missing and likely lost, as it has been 8 and 6 periods respectively. Period 4 order (7 units) is also potentially delayed or lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 139 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P8). Since P1 and P3 are likely lost, 'Effective' pipeline is much lower. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (covering P4-P8) to capture the demand shift from the low 40s back up to 70, resulting in a slightly more responsive forecast for the upcoming spring season. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all samples to ensure adequate safety stock for the lead-time variability and potential stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss suspected: Orders from Period 1 (75 units) and Period 3 (54 units) have not arrived after 8 and 6 periods respectively (Promised L=2). Actual lead time is variable (observed 1 and 2 periods).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 186 units in-transit. Shipments from Period 1 (75 units) and Period 3 (54 units) are definitively lost, as they are now 9 and 7 periods overdue respectively (Promised L=2). Since 'in-transit' includes these lost units but they will never arrive, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be suppressed erroneously. To compensate, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that is significantly higher than the true demand forecast to force the OR engine to place a recovery order despite the inflated pipeline count. Demand history (samples 71, 60, 46, 48, 62 + game history 75, 60, 72, 49, 49, 42, 43, 70, 44) shows an average demand of approximately 55.4 units. With L=2, the base stock for (L+1) periods should be ~166 units plus safety stock. Currently, in-transit is 186 units (containing 129 lost units + Period 4: 7, Period 8: 3, Period 9: 47). I will set mu_hat to 350 to overcome the 129 'ghost' units in the pipeline and trigger inventory replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss confirmed: Orders from P1 (75 units) and P3 (54 units) are lost. Pipeline inventory is inflated by 129 units, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to force replenishment.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 analysis: Demand remains stable around 45-50 units/week. Historical samples show recent demand at 44 (P9) and 45 (P10). The mean for the last 5 samples (P6-P10) is 48.8. Inventory status: On-hand is 5. In-transit is 274, but 129 units (P1: 75, P3: 54) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, though the OR backend still counts them in pipeline inventory. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' to overcome this calculation error. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2 (promised), mean=48.8, and z* approx 1.64 (95% service level), target is (3 * 48.8) + (1.64 * sqrt(3) * 11) \u2248 146.4 + 31.2 \u2248 178. To force a replenishment order despite the 145 'real' pipeline (274 total - 129 lost), mu_hat must be set high enough so that mu_hat - pipeline > 0. Since pipeline=274, target base stock needs to be ~320-350 to cover future demand and handle the systemic undercounting of stock due to losses. Therefore, I set an explicit mu_hat to 350 to ensure we maintain inventory as the large P10 order arrives.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/04/29), we have on-hand inventory of 0 and in-transit units of 379. However, 129 of these units (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost shipments as they have not arrived in over 8 periods. Additionally, there are 105 units ordered in P11 and 138 units ordered in P10 that are within the expected lead time but have not yet arrived. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 48.4 units. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of the 129 lost units in the 'in-transit' count prevents the backend from placing sufficient orders. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target stock level calculation: (L+1) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=2, (3 * 48.4) + 129 = 274.2. I will use mu_hat = 274 to force the logic to ignore the phantom pipeline. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of the most recent demand period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450036' is currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0). While in-transit inventory is listed as 379 units, 129 of these units (orders from P1 and P3) were definitively confirmed lost in Period 10. Consequently, the OR backend's internal pipeline calculation is inflated, leading it to under-order or stop ordering entirely (as seen in Period 12). To circumvent this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to force a high base stock target. The average demand across all periods (including initial samples and game history) is approximately 53 units/week. Given a promised lead time of 2 (L=2, planning for L+1=3 periods), the required base stock is roughly 160-200 units. To trigger a replenishment order despite the 129 'phantom' units in transit, I am setting mu_hat to 350 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline total.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450036 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has a confirmed loss of 129 units from Period 1 (75 units) and Period 3 (54 units). The current in-transit inventory of 279 units includes these 129 lost units, which the OR engine incorrectly counts as available pipeline stock. To trigger an order and maintain service levels, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Current demand is stable with a mean of ~53 units/period over the last 13 periods and ~52 over the last 5 periods. With a promised Lead Time (L) of 2, the Base Stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand, approximately 159 units plus safety stock. However, since the engine subtracts the 279 in-transit units (129 of which are ghost units), the 'effective' pipeline is 150. To compensate, I set mu_hat to 300 to ensure the backend places an order. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/20. We are experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand spike in Period 14 (107 units), likely driven by seasonal spring/pre-summer demand for denim trousers. There is a critical data issue: 'In-transit' inventory stands at 288 units, but 129 of these units (orders from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost, and the 'In-transit' reflects units that will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to subtract from the target base stock. If pipeline is 288 but only 159 are real (288 - 129), the backend will under-order. To compensate, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Recent mean demand (P10-P14) is approx 62 units. Promised lead time L=2. Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock \u2248 3*62 + 1.64*sqrt(3)*15 \u2248 228. Since the backend calculates: Order = Base Stock - Pipeline, and Pipeline is inflated by 129, I must set the mu_hat such that 'Base Stock' is increased by 129 to neutralize the ghost inventory. Target mu_hat \u2248 228 + 129 = 357. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend generates an order despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Period 13-14 average demand increased to 85.5 (+55% from early period average) concurrent with May spring seasonality.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in a clear seasonal demand spike. The last three periods (P13-P15) showed demands of 64, 107, and 139 respectively, averaging approximately 103 units per week, which is significantly higher than the 55% increase noted in P15. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 432 units, but this includes 129 units from P1 and P3 confirmed lost in Period 10, plus 138 units ordered in P10 (now 6 periods ago) which are also likely lost or severely delayed. Adjusting for these losses, effective pipeline inventory is approximately 165 units (Total 432 - 129 - 138), which is insufficient for the current demand regime. With an expected lead time of 1-2 periods, we must cover at least 3 periods of demand (L+1). To overcome the OR backend's inability to discount lost shipments from the pipeline calculation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a current demand mean of ~100. Target base stock = (L+1) * 100 + Safety Stock. To force an order despite the 'In-transit' bloat of 267 lost units, I must elevate mu_hat significantly to ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation triggers a replenishment. I estimate a required replenishment of ~150 units to meet the June climb and cover for the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss update: Period 10 order (138 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing total confirmed/highly probable lost units in 'In-transit' to 267. Demand regime shift: Late May demand has accelerated to ~100 units/week (+80% over early series mean).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), we face extreme inventory shortages and significant shipment losses. Pipeline inventory is currently 693 units, but at least 267 units (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138) are confirmed or highly probable losses as they are far beyond the promised lead time of 2. The recent demand regime (P13-P16) shows a significant increase to an average of 99.5 units/week, likely due to spring/summer seasonality for skinny denim. Current On-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for three consecutive periods (P14-P16). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (total In-transit + On-hand) to decide order quantities. Because the backend is unaware of the 267 lost units, it sees a 'pipeline' of 693, which exceeds the required base stock, thus suppressing orders. To force the backend to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' (representing demand over L+1 periods, where L=2) high enough to offset these lost units. Target base stock = (Effective Demand over 3 periods) + (Safety Stock) + (Compensating for Lost Units). With current demand ~100/week, base stock needs to be ~300 + SS + 267. I am setting mu_hat to 650 with 'explicit' to trigger replenishment and setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the increased volatility in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 13-16 average demand is 99.5 (+81% vs. early series mean). Total confirmed/probable lost units in 'In-transit' updated to 267 (P1, P3, P10).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in June, with demand showing significant volatility but a clear structural increase compared to the early months (avg since Period 13 is ~88, with peaks reaching ~139). The latest observation (Period 17) showed a dip to 46, but previous weeks suggest high variability. There is a critical issue with lost shipments: orders from P1 (75), P3 (54), and P10 (138) are essentially lost (total 267 units). Since the OR backend includes these 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory, it will drastically under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate (1+L) periods of demand (3 weeks) using a mean of 80 units/week (conservative relative to the high-demand regime but accounting for volatility) plus the 267 'lost' units to force the engine to maintain stocks. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the recent high variance observed in May/June.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment total confirmed at 267 units (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138). Pipeline inventory calculations must exclude these units to maintain actual service levels. Period 13-17 average demand is 88.8 units, confirming a 50%+ increase from the P1-P12 average.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 17, 2019 (Period 19). Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' saw a significant spike in mid-May (P14-P16, avg ~111), but has sharply moderated in the last two periods (P17-P18, avg 43). This aligns with a post-spring seasonal cooling. On-hand inventory is high at 319 units due to the arrival of orders from P15 and P16 in Period 17. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 336 units contains 267 units from P1, P3, and P10 that are confirmed/highly likely lost. Excluding these lost units, the effective pipeline is only 69 units (336 - 267), and the total effective position is 388 (319 on-hand + 69 valid in-transit). Given the recent demand drop, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend change from the May peak back to normal levels, while still setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom pipeline inventory. I estimate the target base stock at ~300 (3 periods * 100 units/period safety) to ensure service levels during the transition, but with 388 effective units, the OR backend will correctly minimize new ordering until stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Demand has returned to lower levels (avg 43 in P17-P18) after a significant May spike, suggesting a return to the early-season mean or a post-spring lull.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Julia RW Skinny Denim has returned to a stable lower-level regime following a May seasonal spike. The average demand over the last three periods (P17-P19) is approximately 40 units (46, 40, 34), which aligns with the pre-spike demand mean. On-hand inventory is currently high at 285 units due to the arrival of large orders from P15 and P16 (405 units total) during P17. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 342 includes 273 units from confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138, P12: 5, P14: 1). By excluding these losses, the functional pipeline is approximately 69 units (P17, P19). With 285 on-hand and 69 valid in-transit units, the total inventory position of ~354 is sufficient to cover approximately 8.8 periods of current demand (mean=40). To prevent further accumulation of holding costs on the existing surplus, I am setting mu_hat to a 'recent_N' of 3 to reflect the current lower demand regime, and using the 'default' lead time (2) and sigma settings. This configuration will naturally suppress new ordering until the excess inventory is reduced.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand stabilization confirmed at lower level (~40 units/week) post-May spike. Functional inventory position (On-hand + non-lost In-transit) is high at ~354 units, covering ~9 periods of current demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), the product (Julia RW Skinny Denim Trousers) is in a post-peak seasonal lull. Demand has dropped significantly from the May spike (~100 units/week) to an average of 27.3 units over the last 4 periods (P17-P20). The current On-hand inventory is 277 units. In-transit inventory is 342 units, which includes 275 confirmed/highly probable lost units (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138, P14: 9) and 67 units of active pipeline (P17: 48, P19: 6, P20: 0, plus residual late arrivals). Functional inventory (On-hand 277 + Active Pipelined ~67) is approximately 344 units. At the current demand rate of ~30-40 units/week, this covers over 8 weeks of supply. To prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period) while maintaining the 95% service level goal (implied by the 19:1 profit-to-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the lower demand regime and keeping L at 'calculate' to account for the variable 1-2 period lead time observed in arrived shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units updated to 275 (P1, P3, P10, and now P14 which is 7 periods overdue). Demand remains in a low-volume stability phase post-May spike, averaging <40 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), demand has stabilized following the May peak. Recent demand (P19-P21) has averaged 40.3 units/week. On-hand inventory is 198 units, and In-transit is 342 units. However, we have a significant volume of confirmed/likely lost shipments: P1 (75), P3 (54), P10 (138), and P14 (9), totaling 276 units. The OR backend includes these lost units in its pipeline calculation (effectively seeing 198 + 342 = 540 units), which leads it to believe we have nearly 14 weeks of stock. To counteract this 'ghost' inventory and ensure the backend doesn't completely stop ordering if demand rises, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I use the recent demand mean (~40) and scale it by (1+L) where L=2, but I must subtract the lost units from the target to force the backend to see the 'true' inventory. However, given 198 on-hand units and 66 units remaining in-transit (342 total - 276 lost), my functional inventory is 264 units. At a demand of 40/week, this covers over 6 periods. Therefore, the goal is to prevent the system from over-ordering while keeping parameters realistic. I will set mu_hat to a low 'safety' level using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the post-May stabilization, and calculate L based on history to account for the observed variability (1-2 periods).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-peak stabilization phase following a seasonal demand surge in May. Demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has averaged 47.7 units per week, significantly lower than the May peak but slightly higher than the immediate post-spike lull. Current On-hand inventory is 119 units. In-transit inventory is 342 units, but this includes confirmed/highly probable lost units from Period 1 (75), Period 3 (54), Period 10 (138), and Period 14 (9). Current 'valid' pipeline inventory (undelivered orders from P17-P19) is only 54 units (P17: 48, P19: 6). Total functional inventory (On-hand 119 + Valid In-transit 54) is 173 units. With current demand averaging ~48 units, the current position covers ~3.6 periods of demand. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, the total coverage required is L+1 (3 periods). The current inventory is sufficient for the immediate lead time, but the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will see the total 342 units in-transit and likely order nothing. Therefore, mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on the recent 6-period regime (N=6) to maintain responsiveness to the current stabilized demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Lost shipment total updated to 276 units (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138, P14: 9). These must be mentally excluded when evaluating the 'In-transit' figure of 342. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~48 units/week (P17-P22 average).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-peak demand phase (July). Recent demand (P19-P23) has averaged 54.6 units. The product is a denim trouser, which typically sees consistent demand after seasonal peaks. On-hand inventory is 46 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 342 is misleading due to confirmed lost shipments: P1 (75), P3 (54), P10 (138), and P14 (9), totaling 276 units. Subtracting these from the total in-transit yields an 'active' pipeline of 66 units (27 from P17 and 39 from earlier unaccounted small orders). Effective inventory (On-hand 46 + Active In-transit 66) is 112 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of current demand (Mean ~55). Since the lead time is 2 periods, the OR backend should be prompted to maintain a base stock that accounts for these lost units. By setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that matches recent mean demand (approx 55 units/week) and using 'calculate' for lead time, the system will naturally order to maintain the desired service level despite the inflated pipeline inventory calculation.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 342 units, but based on historical tracking, 276 units are confirmed/highly probable losses (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138, P14: 9). This leaves an effective pipeline of 66 units (ordered P17: 48, P19: 6, and any newer small unrecorded orders). Recent demand (P21-P24) averaged 70 units/week, which is higher than the early-July lull (~40) but lower than the May peak (~100). For P25, the system needs more stock since on-hand is zero. To account for the 276 'phantom' units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Desired base stock = (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Buffer. With L=2, Forecasted_Demand ~ 65, and a buffer for variance, target base stock is ~270. To force an order of ~200 units (accounting for the 66 real units in transit and the 276 lost units), I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - (342 total pipeline)' results in the desired order. Setting mu_hat to 542 should result in an order around 200 units, replenishing the stock for upcoming August demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update: Period 21-24 demand has increased to an average of 70 units/week, up from the post-May lull of 40.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), on-hand inventory is 0 and total in-transit is 573 units. Based on historical tracking, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' balance is lost: Period 1 (75), Period 3 (54), Period 10 (138), and Period 14 (9), totaling 276 lost units. The functional in-transit inventory is therefore 573 - 276 = 297 units (specifically from the large P25 order of 231 and smaller recent orders). Demand has been volatile: after a May spike (~100/week) and a June/July lull (~40/week), the last 5 periods (P21-P25) have averaged 66.2 units/week, indicating a moderate mid-summer recovery. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current demand level (avg ~66). Lead time is set to 'calculate' as actuals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. The massive P25 order (231 units) is expected to arrive in P27 or P28, which should replenish on-hand stock soon. Maintaining current parameters to avoid over-ordering while waiting for that large arrival.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/08/12), we are facing a complete stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has recently averaged 70 units over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) and spiked to 91 in P26, indicating a late-summer seasonal increase for skinny denim trousers. The current 'In-transit' of 573 units is highly distorted by lost shipments. Our record shows confirmed/likely lost units from P1 (75), P3 (54), P10 (138), P14 (9), and P17 (48), totaling 324 units. Additionally, the order from P19 (6 units) is now 8 periods overdue and also lost. Total lost units in the pipeline are 330. The only valid in-transit order is the 231 units from Period 25 (expected to arrive during Period 27). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet current demand around 70-90 units/week while correcting for the 330 phantom units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate mu_hat as (L+1) * Average Demand - Correction. With L=2, (3 * 75) = 225. Adding the 330 units of 'phantom' inventory to the target base stock results in an explicit mu_hat of 555 units. This forces the engine to recognize the need for replenishment despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units updated to 330 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19). Demand regime in August has increased to ~75 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (2019-08-19). Demand for this denim TRS SKU has seen a significant increase in the last few periods, with Period 26 at 91 and Period 27 at 106. The Period 21-24 average was ~70, but the most recent pulse suggests a higher mean around 100. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 372. Based on historical data and Carry-over insights, at least 330 units in the pipeline are confirmed or highly probable lost (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138, P14: 9, P17: 48, P19: 6). This leaves a functional pipeline of only 42 units (the P27 order of 30 plus a small residual). With 125 units on hand and 42 functional units in transit, our total functional inventory is 167 units, which covers approximately 1.7 periods of demand at the current 100-unit/week rate. Given a lead time (L) of 2, we need to ensure (L+1)=3 periods of demand cover. At 100 units/week, the base stock should be around 300. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated 'In-transit' field, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as: Target Base Stock (300) + Lost Pipeline (330) = 630. This ensures the backend calculates a replenishment need of roughly 130-150 units. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for recent demand volatility (79 to 106).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units updated to 330 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19). Current demand regime (mid-August) shows a sustained increase to ~100 units/week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), demand has surged to a new high regime, averaging ~100 units/week over the last three weeks (P26: 91, P27: 106, P28: 101). The product description (denim trousers) and the timing suggest late-summer/back-to-school demand. Inventory reconcile: On-hand is low at 24. 'In-transit' shows 547 units, but a large portion is confirmed lost or highly probable lost. Specifically, orders from P1 (75), P3 (54), P10 (138), P14 (9), P17 (48), and P19 (6) total 330 units that are severely overdue and almost certainly lost. This leaves a 'functional' pipeline of 217 units (547 total - 330 lost), which consists of the P27 order (30) and P28 order (175). Since the OR backend uses the full 547 'In-transit' figure, it will under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted to account for the phantom inventory. I set mu_hat explicitly to the (1+L) * target_demand + lost_units. With L=2 (3 periods of coverage) and mean demand at 100, the baseline mu_hat would be 300. Adding the 330 lost units to bypass the backend's subtraction leads to an explicit mu_hat of 630. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility observed during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Functional pipeline analysis confirms 330 units in 'In-transit' are lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19). Demand regime for late August is stabilized at ~100 units/week, suggesting a seasonal peak.

History confirms a substantial number of lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19) totaling 330 units. These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 664, making the functional pipeline 334 units (664 - 330). The on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the 330 ghost units in the pipeline, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: With L=2, the target base stock needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). At 90 units/week, the base stock should be approximately 270 units + safety stock. However, since the OR engine subtracts the full 664 in-transit from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the 330 lost units. Target base stock (~330) + offset (330) = 660. I will set mu_hat to 660 and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high volatility observed in August (approx 25 per week, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~43).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Functional pipeline confirmed at 334 units; 330 units in 'In-transit' are lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19). Demand for late August averaged ~88 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), demand for this skinny denim item is in a late-summer/early-autumn peak, averaging approximately 92 units over the last 4 periods (P27-P30: 106, 101, 56, 104). The 'In-transit' figure of 530 units is heavily inflated by ghost inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P1 (75), P3 (54), P10 (138), P14 (9), P17 (48), and P19 (6), totaling 330 units. Subtracting these from the 530 in-transit leaves 200 units of functional pipeline (P29 order of 117 and P30 order of 71, plus a small residual). On-hand is 101. Total functional inventory is ~301. With a lead time of 2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 276 units at the current mean). The OR system sees 101 on-hand + 530 in-transit = 631 units, which is far above the required stock, and would normally stop ordering. To force the OR backend to maintain the required service level despite the 'lost' units, I am using an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the 330 units of missing pipeline. Expected demand (1+L=3) is 276. Adding the 330 lost units results in a target mu_hat of 606 to ensure the system places necessary replenishment orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed lost units in 'In-transit' remain at 330 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19). Current demand regime in September remains stabilized at a peak of ~92 units/week (+84% vs. early-year baseline).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The product is skinny denim trousers, which often see sustained demand in autumn. Demand has stabilized at a high plateau (average of 88.3 units over the last 6 periods). I suspect the 330 units identified in previous carry-over insights (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19) are indeed lost. Additionally, the order from P29 (117 units) is now 3 periods overdue (exceeding the promised L=2) but is not yet definitively lost; however, I must account for this potential delay. Pipeline inventory is currently 565 units, but 330 are confirmed lost, leaving 235 'functional' units in transit. With on-hand inventory at 14, the functional position is 249 units. To maintain a service level for the peak autumn period (\u03bc ~ 92 per period), I will set mu_hat explicitly to ignore the dead pipeline stock. Using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat (since Period 26) captures the current peak regime (~88 units/week) across the lead time of 2+1 periods. I will use N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and set L=2 as the baseline, as recent arrivals (P27, P28) confirm lead times of 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Functional pipeline inventory confirmed to exclude 330 units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19). Order P29 (117 units) is currently 3 periods overdue. Demand remains in an autumn peak regime (P26-P31 average: 88.3 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (2019/09/23), the product is in its autumn demand phase. Recent demand (last 7 periods) average is 88.1 units. The pipeline inventory is currently 459 units, but historical tracking confirms that 330 of these units are lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19). This leaves a 'functional' in-transit inventory of 129 units (459 - 330). The 'functional' pipeline includes the 117 units ordered in P29, which is now 4 periods overdue and likely also lost, though I will wait one more period before final confirmation. If P29 is also lost, the functional pipeline is near zero. Given on-hand inventory is 58 units and expected weekly demand is ~90, current stock is insufficient. To account for the 330 confirmed lost units inflating the backend's pipeline calculations, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' that targets a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (~270 units) plus an offset for the ghost inventory. Base Stock = (1+L)*mu + z*sigma. Using L=2, mu=90, sigma=20, and q=0.95 (z=1.64), base stock would be ~325. Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (459), I must set mu_hat explicitly high: 325 (desired) + 330 (offset for lost units) = 655.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Functional pipeline assessment suggests P29 (117 units) is now 4 periods overdue and highly likely lost, potentially bringing total lost units to 447. Confirmed lost units remain at 330 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19). Demand regime remains stable at ~90 units/week for September.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, on-hand inventory is 0 following a large demand spike of 136 in Period 33. The In-transit figure of 655 units is deceptive due to extensive historical shipment losses. Confirmed losses include P1 (75), P3 (54), P10 (138), P14 (9), P17 (48), and P19 (6), totaling 330 units. Additionally, P29 (117) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. Total functional losses = 447 units. The adjusted pipeline inventory is (655 - 447) = 208 units, which consists primarily of the P33 order (196 units). Since Promised Lead Time L=2, the P33 order is expected to arrive during Period 35. Demand has entered an autumn peak; the average of the last 8 periods (P26-P33) is ~93 units/week. To ensure availability during this peak while accounting for the lost pipeline, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime, and explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approx 3 periods * 93 + buffer for losses) targets a robust base stock that offsets the 447 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in 'In-transit' updated to 447 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, and now P29 which is 5 periods overdue). Autumn demand regime (Sept) is confirmed at ~93 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (early autumn). Historical demand indicates a sustained high-demand regime starting late August, with the last 8 periods (P27-P34) averaging 92.75 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 723 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Confirmed/highly probable lost units are: P1 (75), P3 (54), P10 (138), P14 (9), P17 (48), P19 (6), and P29 (117), totaling 447 units. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P33 (196 units) and P34 (68 units), totaling 264 units. Given total functional inventory (On-hand 0 + Functional In-transit 264) and an expected demand of ~93 units/week, we have approximately 2.8 periods of coverage. With a lead time of 2, this is tight but acceptable. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the autumn peak (approx 93 * 3 = 279) and keep sigma_hat at recent_N=8 to account for recent volatility (std ~24 over that period). No massive adjustment is needed this period as the functional pipeline is relatively healthy compared to the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in 'In-transit' remains 447 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29). Autumn demand regime (Sept-Oct) is stable at ~93 units/week.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and entering mid-October. Historically, demand for denim trousers remains steady but may experience a transition. The current 'In-transit' of 723 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. As of Period 35, I identified 447 units as lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, and P29). Subtracting these from the 723 leaves a functional pipeline of 276 units (orders from P33 and P34). The autumn demand regime (Sept-Oct) has averaged approximately 93 units per week. To ensure internal OR calculations (which include all 723 units in the pipeline) don't stop replenishment prematurely, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I need a base stock to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand plus a buffer. At ~93 units/week, 3 periods of demand is 279 units. Since functional pipeline (276) is almost exactly matching 3 periods of demand but on-hand is 0, I will set mu_hat slightly higher to trigger a small safety order and maintain availability. I'll use explicit sigma_hat based on the recent demand volatility (approx 30).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a high autumn peak (avg ~90) to what appears to be a lower late-October regime, with the last two recorded demands at 53 and 57. Currently, on-hand inventory is 139. The 'In-transit' figure of 527 is misleading due to substantial accumulated losses. Confirmed/highly probable losses total 447 units (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138, P14: 9, P17: 48, P19: 6, P29: 117). This leaves a functional pipeline of 80 units (P34 order: 68, plus small discrepancies). Actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure replenishment despite the inflated pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand for the next 3 periods (L=2 + 1) to be approximately 180 units (using a mean of ~60 units/week based on the recent two-week stabilization). This allows the OR backend to reconcile the functional need against the (erroneous) high in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in 'In-transit' remains 447 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29). Demand has transitioned from the Sept peak to a lower October level, averaging 55 units/week over the last 2 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the demand for skinny denim trousers has transitioned from the September peak (~92 units/week) to a stabilized October level (P35-P37 average of ~65 units/week). Inventory evaluation: On-hand is 54 and 'In-transit' is 527. However, historical analysis (Carry-over insights) confirms that 447 units in the pipeline are lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, and P29). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 527 - 447 = 80 units (from Period 34). The current functional inventory position is 54 (on-hand) + 80 (valid in-transit) = 134 units. At a demand rate of ~65 units/week and a lead time of 2-3 periods, 134 units covers approximately 2 weeks of future demand, which is sufficient but requires monitoring. The OR backend's pipeline inventory is grossly inflated by the lost 447 units (527 total), so I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this inflation and prevent the system from under-ordering in future periods. I'll set mu_hat based on the recent 3-week average (~65) multiplied by (1+L), while sigma reflects the volatility of the recent transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime has stabilized at a lower October level of ~65 units/week (P35-P37) following the September peak. Functional inventory position (excluding 447 lost units) is 134 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450036 is currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a Period 38 demand of 91 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 527 units is heavily distorted by historical shipment losses. Specifically, periods 1, 3, 10, 14, 17, 19, and 29 (totaling 447 units) are highly probable losses based on their extreme lead-time deviations (4+ periods beyond promised). This leaves a functional 'In-transit' of 80 units (from Period 34, which is currently overdue but not yet confirmed lost). Demand in late October/early November remains resilient, averaging ~77 units over the last 4 weeks (P35-P38). To maintain service levels given the 0 on-hand position, mu_hat is set to cover the projected demand for (L+1) periods. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (2.0 periods). sigma_hat 'recent_N' (N=10) is used to capture recent volatility during this transitional demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Functional pipeline analysis confirms 447 units in 'In-transit' are lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29). Demand has remained higher than the predicted mid-October lull, averaging ~77 units/week over P35-P38.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the product is in a post-peak autumn demand phase. Recent demand (P35-P39) has averaged approximately 68.6 units/week, though inventory stockouts in P38 and P39 have likely masked true demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 527 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. My cumulative tracking identifies 447 units as lost (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138, P14: 9, P17: 48, P19: 6, P29: 117). This leaves a functional pipeline of only 80 units (primarily from P34: 68 units). With lead time L=2, the base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~206 units). Given the functional pipeline of 80 and on-hand of 0, the backend needs to order ~126 units to maintain service levels. To bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated 527-unit pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock level (around 730), which after subtracting the 527 'In-transit' units, should trigger an order of approximately 200 units, ensuring coverage for the upcoming mid-November demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Functional pipeline confirmed at 80 units; 447 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed/probable lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29). Late October/early November demand regime stabilized at ~75 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the functional state of SKU 554450036 is critical. The 'In-transit' figure of 805 units is heavily inflated by 447 units deemed lost/missing (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29). Subtracting these results in an actual pipeline of 358 units (P34 order of 68 units + P40 order of 278 units + small residual units). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P37-P40) has averaged 78.5 units/week, indicating a higher late-autumn regime than previously estimated. To ensure replenishment against this actual demand while accounting for the ~447-unit hole in the backend's pipeline calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) * 80 units/week = 3 * 80 = 240 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full 805 'In-transit' from this stock goal, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 447 lost units. Target base stock should be ~240 (demand) + ~115 (safety stock) = 355 units. To get the OR backend to actually order, mu_hat must be set to approximately 355 + 447 = 802. I will set mu_hat to 800 to stabilize the 0 on-hand position.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Lost unit total remains 447 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29). Demand regime for November has stabilized at a higher-than-expected average of ~78 units/week. Functional pipeline (excluding lost units) is 358 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), the product (Julia RW Skinny Denim) is likely in a pre-holiday or early winter demand phase. Current demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) has averaged 69 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0, and the In-transit figure is heavily distorted by historical shipment losses. Confirmed/highly probable lost units are: P1 (75), P3 (54), P10 (138), P14 (9), P17 (48), P19 (6), and P29 (117), totaling 447 units. The actual functional pipeline consists of P34 (68 units), P40 (278 units), and P41 (41 units), totaling 387 units. Since promised Lead Time is 2, the order from P40 should arrive during P42 (visible in P43), potentially bringing 278 units. To maintain appropriate stock levels without over-ordering due to the system's incorrect perception of 'In-transit' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a base stock target of approximately 450 units (covering L+1 weeks of demand plus safety stock at ~75 units/week), while using 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for recent variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Functional pipeline inventory confirmed at 387 units (P34, P40, P41); 447 units in 'In-transit' are recorded as lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29). Demand regime for November remains stable at ~75 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observed a massive demand spike of 268 units, coinciding with late November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday week), which significantly exceeded the previous stable regime of ~75 units/week. This spike combined with the 0 starting inventory led to a total stockout. Regarding inventory, the total 'In-transit' is 846 units. Based on historical data, 447 units are confirmed/highly probable lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29). Additionally, orders from P34 (68 units), P40 (278 units), and P41 (41 units) are still in the pipeline. Since P34 is now 8 periods overdue, I am moving it to the 'lost' category. This brings total estimated lost units to 515. The functional pipeline consists of P40 (278) and P41 (41), totaling 319 units. Given the high demand spike in P42 (268) and the approach of the December holiday season, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for a sustained higher demand level of ~110 units/week (330 units over L+1) to ensure the OR engine replenishes enough stock to cover the functional pipeline, as on-hand is zero and we must mitigate the impact of the 515 lost units currently inflating the backend's 'In-transit' view.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike confirmed at Period 42 (268 units) during Cyber Week. Total confirmed/highly probable lost units in 'In-transit' updated to 515 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29, and now P34 which is 8 periods overdue). Functional pipeline consists of P40 and P41 (319 units).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are entering the mid-December period. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 268 (Cyber Week) but retreated to 71 in Period 43, which is consistent with early December activity. The 'In-transit' stock of 527 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Our audit confirms 515 units are lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29, and P34). The only 'live' item in transit was P41 (41 units), which arrived in Period 43. Thus, functional pipeline inventory is currently 0. On-hand inventory is 248 units. Given the post-Cyber Week stabilization, I expect demand to average around 75 units/week (based on the pre-spike November mean). Current on-hand of 248 units covers approximately 3.3 periods of demand (248 / 75). With a lead time (L) of 2-3 periods, the system is currently balanced but needs to monitor for the next holiday spike or end-of-year clearance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat (P40-P43 average: 122.25) to capture the recent volatility without overreacting to the single 268 spike, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high variance introduced by the holiday peak. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P40, P41) show L=2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Lost shipment total updated to 515 units (P1: 75, P3: 54, P10: 138, P14: 9, P17: 48, P19: 6, P29: 117, P34: 68). These must be excluded from pipeline inventory logic. Functional pipeline inventory is currently 0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are in mid-December. Demand for the last two periods (P43-P44) has stabilized at 70-71 units following the Cyber Week spike (P42: 268). Functional inventory position must be carefully calculated. Current In-transit is 527. According to carry-over insights, 515 units are confirmed or highly probable lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). This leaves only 12 units of functional pipeline (Total In-transit 527 - Lost 515). On-hand is 178. Current functional inventory = 178 + 12 = 190. With demand around 70/week and a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need to cover 3-4 periods of demand (~210 to 280 units). Our current 190 units is slightly below this safety level. I set L to 'calculate' as actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3. I set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 210, which represents (1+L) * 70 units/week for a base 3-week window (Review + Lead). To ensure the OR backend orders the necessary units for the Christmas/New Year period while accounting for the phantom pipeline (lost units), I must offset mu_hat. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 527 'In-transit' from base_stock, I will provide an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the lost 515 units. Formula: target_base_stock + lost_units = 210 + 515 = 725. This forces a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed/probable lost units in 'In-transit' remains 515 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). Post-Cyber Week demand has stabilized at ~70 units/week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd, just before the Christmas/End-of-Year sales period. Historical demand for the last few periods (P43-P45) has been around 74 units/week, excluding the Cyber Week spike in P42. The functional pipeline inventory assessment is critical: the 'In-transit' figure of 797 includes 515 units confirmed/highly probable as lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). This leaves 282 units in transit (specifically the P45 order of 270 units). On-hand inventory is 97. Total functional inventory is 97 + 270 = 367. Given the lead time L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods. With current demand around 75, 367 units covers nearly 5 weeks, making the current position safe. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the post-Cyber Week stabilization, and L using recent_N=5 (tracking recent arrivals at 2-3 periods). I will use a conservative sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed/probable lost units in 'In-transit' reach 515 (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). Post-Cyber Week demand (P43-P45) is stable at ~74 units/week. Dec 23rd marks the start of the holiday/end-of-year peak, warranting close observation for demand acceleration in the next period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Dec 30, right after the Christmas/Holiday peak and before the January sales. Demand in Period 46 was 54, showing a slight decrease compared to the pre-holiday weeks (~74 units/week), which is typical for the post-Christmas week. However, January often sees clearing sales that can sustain demand. Functional inventory assessment: On-hand is 43 units. In-transit is total 797 units. Based on long-term tracking, we have 515 confirmed/highly probable lost units (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). This leaves a functional pipeline of 282 units (P45: 270 units, plus 12 units unaccounted for from other entries like P6/P8 remainders). Total functional position is ~325 units. Given the stabilized demand regime of ~70 units/week, we have roughly 4.6 periods of cover. With L=2, (L+1) demand is ~210 units. Our functional position of 325 is currently sufficient, so the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to avoid excess holding costs as we move out of the holiday peak. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable Q4 demand (~105 mean including the Cyber week spike) and explicit L=2 to maintain standard responsiveness.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Functional pipeline assessment confirms 515 units in 'In-transit' are lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P19, P29, P34). Current functional inventory is ~325 units. Post-holiday demand (late Dec) shows a typical tapering (54 units) but remains within the Q4 stability range (70-80 units/week excluding spikes).
