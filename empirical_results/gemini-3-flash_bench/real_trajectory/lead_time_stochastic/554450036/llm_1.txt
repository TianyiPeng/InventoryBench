Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) show a mean of 57.4 units per week (min: 46, max: 71), indicating relatively stable baseline demand for a year-round clothing item. With a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods, the total lead time plus inspection window is L+1 = 3 periods. I need to cover the current period (P1) and the two periods before the first shipment arrives (P2, P3). Based on the historical average of ~58 units/week, I calculate a base requirement of 174 units (58 * 3). However, given the variance in history (up to 71), I will add a small safety stock to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost. I am ordering 190 units to ensure coverage through the arrival of the first shipment and establish initial stock, as current on-hand inventory is 0.",

These are basic apparel items with relatively stable demand, though they can see spikes during pre-spring shopping. Historical demand shows a range of 46\u201371 units per week (avg ~57). Period 1 actual demand was 75 units, suggesting a slight upward trend or seasonality relative to the historical average. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 190 (ordered in Period 1). Arrival Logic: Promised lead time is 2. Following the timeline, an order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible/usable in P4. We are currently in P2. Demand Forecast: The next few weeks likely need ~75 units/period. Target Inventory: We need to cover demand until the next reachable order arrives. Since the P1 order (190) arrives in P3, it covers approx 2.5 periods of demand (190 / 75 = 2.5). However, to maintain a pipeline and account for the 2-period lead time, I need to order now (P2) to ensure availability for P4/P5. Expected stockouts in P2 and P3 are unavoidable due to 0 starting inventory and lead time. Calculation: Expected demand for P2-P4 is ~225 units. We have 190 in transit. To buffer against the high P1 demand (75) and carry safety stock, I will order 100 units to secure the pipeline for Period 4/5 arrival.",

Current on-hand is 0, and we have 290 units in transit. Demand for P1 (75) and P2 (60) was lost because of zero on-hand inventory. To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1 = 3), I need approximately 180-210 units (60-70 per week). Total pipeline (290) exceeds this immediate 3-period need, but since specific arrivals occur sequentially, I must ensure I don't run out again after the initial stock arrives.

However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or that lead time is at least 3 periods.

Expected demand for Periods 4, 5, and 6 (coverage for L+1) is approximately 70 * 3 = 210 units.

The Period 1 order (190 units) is CURRENTLY MISSING as it should have arrived in Period 3 (conclude).

Following the stockout in P24-P25, the P23 order of 180 units arrived in P26 with a lead time of 3 periods, leaving 89 units on hand for P27. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods (but often varies between 1 and 3, with significant risk of loss), I need to maintain enough inventory to cover approximately 3 periods of demand to prevent further stockouts. Historical demand in August (P26) was 91; assuming a high-regime mean of ~90 units/week, the target inventory is ~270 units.

Analysis of the history shows a recurring pattern of shipment losses (~40% historical rate) and lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods). Recent demand (Oct-Nov) is averaging ~80 units per week (P37: 85, P38: 91). Currently, on-hand inventory is 34. The 'In-transit' figure of 1255 is misleading due to cumulative lost orders (estimated at 1065+ units). The realistic pipeline consists of P36 (130 units) and P38 (60 units). The P36 order is now at L=3, which is the upper bound of typical successful deliveries; if it arrives this period (P39), it will satisfy immediate demand. However, given the high loss rate and to prevent a stock-out in P40/P41 during the early November window, a safety-oriented order is required. I will target a coverage of ~220 units (approx. 2.5 weeks of demand) considering the high risk of one of the upcoming shipments failing.",

Supply chain reliability remains a significant concern, with a ~40% historical order failure rate. Assessing the pipeline: The Period 34 order (120 units) is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost. The current 'In-transit' balance of 1245 units is dominated by approximately 1065 units of confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26, P29, P34). The functional pipeline consists only of the P38 order (60 units) and the P39 order (120 units). Current on-hand is 107.

The supply chain is highly unreliable, with a ~40% historical order loss rate and a variable lead time of 1-3 periods. As of P41, on-hand inventory is 26 units.

The functional pipeline consists only of the P38 order (60 units), P39 order (120 units), and P40 order (120 units). To maintain a safety stock during the late November period and mitigate the 40% loss risk, I need to ensure the pipeline covers demand for at least 3 periods (L+1). Target stock for the next 3 weeks at 80 units/week is 240 units. Current functional inventory (OH 26 + P38 60 + P39 120 + P40 120) = 326.
