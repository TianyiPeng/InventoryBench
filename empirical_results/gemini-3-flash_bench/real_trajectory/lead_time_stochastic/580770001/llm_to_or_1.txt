Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Kai jumper'. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 152.6 and an upward trend peaking at 203 before returning to 156. As we are in mid-February, demand for knitwear (Womens Everyday Collection) is expected to remain steady or slightly increase before the spring transition. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the leads time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 historical samples to capture the recent mean of ~152.6 units/week. Since there is significant volatility in the historical data (std \u2248 38.6), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to provide a localized volatility estimate for the OR engine to calculate a sufficient safety stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we placed our first order of 213 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, those units are expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 decision phase. Demand for P1 was 117, resulting in 117 lost sales because we started with 0 on-hand inventory. The product is a 'Kai jumper', a cotton-blend sweater for women. We are currently in mid-February, which is typically a strong period for knitwear sales as winter transitions. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 152 units/week with a peak of 203. Recent samples (106, 133, 203, 165, 156, and now 117) suggest a slightly higher recent mean (~156). Given the lead time of 2, the goal is to cover $(1+L) = 3$ periods of demand. I will use the last 5 samples (P-3 to P1) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they capture the current late-winter demand regime more accurately than the full history.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's cotton-blend jumper. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) has been stable but showing potential growth (avg ~148). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (213 units) and P2 (209 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time, the P1 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P3) and will be visible in the P4 start update. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with no stock. I will use the last 5 samples (including pre-game history: 106, 133, 203, 165, 156) to estimate demand. The average demand is 152.6 and the standard deviation is 36.6. With L=2, mu_hat should target (1+2)*152.6 = 457.8, and sigma_hat should target sqrt(3)*36.6 = 63.4. I will use 'recent_5' to capture the slightly higher recent demand levels while maintaining a buffer for the expected arrival of P1's order.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a 'Kai jumper', a cotton-blend sweater for women. Reviewing historical demand (given from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04), demand was stable between 106 and 203 (avg ~152). However, in the last three periods (P1-P3), realized demand has been lower (117, 109, 60). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (213 units) were expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P3's 'conclude' message (read at P4 start). Since P3 conclude shows arrived=0, and there is no confirmation of the P1 order, we are facing either a lead time delay or a lost shipment. On-hand inventory is 0 and we have 450 units in transit (P1: 213, P2: 209, P3: 28). Given the 'soft, rib-knit cotton blend' description, this is a transitional spring piece. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay (P1 order hasn't arrived by P3 conclude). I will use the last 5 samples (recent_N=5) for demand forecasting, which includes the lower recent weeks, to avoid over-ordering while waiting for the pipeline to clear.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (March 11, 2019). The product is a 'Kai jumper' (cotton blend knitwear). Historical demand (samples + game history) shows: 106, 133, 203, 165, 156 (initial samples) and 117, 109, 60, 38 (game periods). There is a clear downward trend as we move further into spring. Specifically, demand dropped significantly in Period 3 (60) and Period 4 (38). Inventory status: On-hand is 171. In-transit consists of 213 (P1), 28 (P3), and 36 (P4). Period 2's order of 209 arrived in Period 4 (LT=2). Period 1's order (ordered P1, expected P3) has not arrived and is likely lost or significantly delayed, as we are now in P5. The promised lead time is 2. Since actual lead time for the only successful arrival was 2, I will keep L at default. For mu_hat, the recent demand (last 3 periods: 60, 38, and whatever P5 turns out to be) is much lower than the historical average (~130+). I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture this downward 'post-winter' shift in jumper demand. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility at these lower volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Demand for 580770001 (women's jumper) is declining as spring progresses (dropped from ~150 to ~50 over 4 weeks). Period 1 shipment (213 units) is likely lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's cotton-blend jumper. Historical demand shows a clear downward trend as spring progresses (P1: 117, P2: 109, P3: 60, P4: 38, P5: 88). While P5 saw a small uptick to 88, the overall mean since P3 is approximately 62. The P1 order (213 units) is now 3 periods past its promised lead time and remains 'in-transit', confirming it is likely lost. The P2 order (209 units) arrived exactly on time (L=2). P3 (28 units) and P4 (36 units) orders are still within the expected delivery window (due P5 and P6 respectively). However, because P5 conclude shows 'arrived=0', the P3 order is at least 1 period late. I will set L=3 to account for this recent delay. Given the seasonal decline for knitwear in late March, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand to capture the lower spring volume (avg ~62) rather than the higher winter volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time lengthening: Order from Period 3 (due P5) did not arrive, suggesting L=3 or higher is now more representative than promised L=2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (March 25). The SKU is a women's ribbed cotton jumper. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal decline as we move into spring: P1 (117), P2 (109), P3 (60), P4 (38), P5 (88), P6 (45). The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 58 units. Regarding logistics: Period 1 shipment (213 units) is confirmed lost as it is 4 periods overdue. The Period 3 order (28 units) is currently 1 period overdue (promised L=2, now at P7), which supports the insight that actual lead time has likely shifted to L=3. Period 4 order (36 units) is also in-transit. On-hand inventory is 38. Given high holding costs relative to profit (1:1), we must be cautious not to over-order during a downward seasonal trend. I will set L=3 to reflect current delays, and use recent_N=4 for demand to capture the lower spring volume (~58 units/week). The OR backend will target a base stock covering (L+1)=4 weeks of demand (approx 232 units). Current in-transit (277) minus the lost P1 shipment (213) leaves 64 valid units in-transit + 38 on-hand = 102 units total inventory. The OR engine's cap and base stock logic will reconcile this.

Carry-over insight: L=3 confirmed: Period 3 order (due P5) still not arrived by P7. Demand stabilization: Spring demand for knitwear is averaging ~58 units/week (last 4 periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for this women's cotton jumper has stabilized during the spring season at approximately 58 units/week (last 4 periods: 38, 88, 45, 51). The Period 1 order (213 units) is confirmed lost as it's 5 periods overdue. The Period 3 order (28 units) is also significantly delayed (intended for P5 arrival), and the Period 4 order (36 units) is now due. The lead time L is set to explicit '3' to reflect the observed delays, although total in-transit quantity (277 units) theoretically covers future demand, much of that is likely tied to the lost P1 shipment. Setting L=3 and using recent demand (last 4 periods) for mu_hat ensures the OR engine aims for a base stock targeting ~232 units (4 periods of demand). Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1), the OR engine will naturally be conservative, but we must account for the actual delivery delays and the lost shipment by using more realistic parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time L=4+ currently indicated as Period 3 (28 units) and Period 4 (36 units) orders haven't arrived. Spring demand remains stable at ~58 units/week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are in early spring for a women's knit jumper. The demand has stabilized into a lower spring regime, averaging approximately 58 units/week over the last 4-5 weeks (P4-P8: 38, 88, 45, 51, 67). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The major issue is lead-time reliability and lost shipments. The Period 1 order (213 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 3 order (28 units, placed 6 weeks ago) and Period 4 order (36 units, placed 5 weeks ago) have still not arrived, despite a promised lead time of 2. This indicates a current actual lead time L \u2265 5. To restore inventory while accounting for high volatility in lead times and the seasonal nature of the product, I will set L=5. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the stable spring demand (~58 units/week * (1+5) = 348). I am using explicit sigma_hat to increase safety stock given the massive uncertainty in arrivals and recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time extended to L=5. Period 3 and Period 4 orders (64 units total) are significantly overdue (5+ weeks) and may be lost or severely delayed.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we face a knitwear (women's jumper) SKU with significant supply chain issues and stable spring demand. Historical demand for the last five periods (P5-P9) has averaged 58.4 units/week. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 347 units in-transit. Crucially, the Period 1 order (213 units) is confirmed lost, and orders from Period 3 (28 units) and Period 4 (36 units) are now 6-7 weeks old (promised L=2), indicating they are also likely lost or severely delayed. To prevent the OR backend from over-counting this 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I will explicitly set L to 5 (the observed delay for the P3 order) and mu_hat to cover current demand levels. By using L=5, the backend's base stock calculation (1+L) * demand will target 6 periods of coverage (~350 units), which reconciles against our total in-transit (347) minus the lost Period 1 units. Setting mu_hat explicitly allows us to stabilize around the observed 58 units/week while ignoring the higher winter demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Supply failure confirmed. Orders from P1 (213), P3 (28), and P4 (36) totaling 277 units are likely lost (all >5 weeks old). Total pipeline 'in-transit' is misleading; only recent orders (P9: 70 units) should be considered active.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the order from Period 9 arrived with an actual lead time of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2 periods. This arrival (70 units) has partially replenished on-hand inventory to 44. However, orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 277 units) are confirmed lost as they haven't arrived in over 7-10 weeks. This is critical because the OR engine's 'inventory view' includes these 277 phantom units in the pipeline, which would lead it to under-order or order nothing. Current demand (April/Spring) has stabilized at a lower level (~30-50 units) compared to winter. The Period 10 demand was 26. I will set L to 1 based on the most recent successful arrival. To bypass the phantom pipeline inventory and ensure the OR backend places an order for roughly one week of demand (plus a safety buffer), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I'll target a base stock of approximately 80 units (2 weeks of demand at ~40 units/week). Since on-hand is 44 and the ONLY real pipeline is the P10 order of 1, I need the OR engine to see a need for ~35 units. Set mu_hat to 80 and sigma_hat to 15.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery: Period 9 order arrived in Period 10 (L=1), suggesting recent shipments are moving even though P1, P3, and P4 (277 units) are permanently lost. Summer demand regime confirmed: weekly demand for knitwear is now in the 25-45 range.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Jumper) has entered a lower-demand summer regime, averaging approximately 30 units/week over the last three periods (Period 9-11: 41, 26, 25). Regarding supply, we have confirmed that orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 277 units) are lost, as they are now 8-11 weeks overdue. These lost units artificially inflate the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, which would prevent the OR engine from ordering more stock if not corrected. The actual viable inventory is 19 on-hand plus the 1 unit ordered in P10 (total 20). The recent successful shipment (P9 order arriving in P10) showed a lead time of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2. To force the backend to ignore the 277 lost units and meet the current demand, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the current demand rate (~30/week) plus the volume of lost shipments (277 units). By setting mu_hat high enough to offset the phantom pipeline, the engine will order sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon. Calculating mu_hat: With L=2, (L+1)=3. Targeted coverage = 3 * 30 = 90. Backend logic: effective stock = (90 + 277 lost) = 367. To ensure we maintain stock, I will use mu_hat=367 and sigma_hat=15 to reflect relatively stable summer demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (2019/05/06). The product is a women's jumper, now entering May. Demand has stabilized into a summer regime, with recent weekly samples of 26, 25, and 44 (mean ~31.7). The supply chain is still characterized by significant historical losses (P1, P3, P4 orders totaling 277 units are permanently lost) and high in-transit numbers (348) that are misleading. Only P10 (1 unit) and P12 (70 units) are realistically expected to arrive. Because on-hand is 0 and we are facing stockouts, we need to maintain a base stock that ignores the 277 lost units. Recent lead time was observed at 1 period (P9 order arrived P10), but promised is 2. I will set L=3 as an explicit buffer to account for the unreliability of the supply chain. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the 30-40 units/week summer demand, which for L=3 translates to a target demand across 4 periods (1+L). Using explicit sigma_hat allows me to manage the volatility of low seasonal demand and unreliable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline confirmed: mean ~32 units/week (Periods 10-12). Supply chain remains split between lost legacy shipments (277 units) and active recent shipments (71 units).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 580770001 (women's knitwear) is in a summer demand regime where demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~32-40 units/week) compared to early spring. Period 13 demand was 43, continuing this pattern. Supply chain issues persist: out of 348 units in-transit, 277 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are over 9 weeks old and confirmed lost. The only 'live' inventory is the 70 units ordered in Period 12, which should arrive in Period 14 (L=2) or Period 15. On-hand is currently 0. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (base_stock - pipeline), and 277/348 units are phantom inventory, the system will chronically under-order. I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target inventory level to compensate for these 277 lost units. Target mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+ review)) + Lost units. With L=2 and mean demand ~38, target is (38 * 3) + 277 = 391. I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent shipments (P9) showed lead times have stabilized.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), the item (Womens Knitwear Jumper) is in a low-demand summer regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 32 units/week (26, 25, 44, 43, 38). Lead times for recent successful shipments have been 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived P10, P12 arrived P14), suggesting supply stability for new orders despite the 277 units lost from early periods (P1, P3, P4). The 'In-transit' figure of 321 units is misleading because 277 units are permanently lost and only 44 units (from P10 and P14) are actually active pipeline inventory. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the target base stock, I am using the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat. Specifically, for an L=2 environment, we target (L+1) periods of demand, which is 3 * 32 = 96 units. Since we have 32 on-hand and 44 active in-transit (Total = 76), the backend *should* order 20 units. However, because the backend sees 321 in-transit, it will order 0 unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 277 units. I will set mu_hat to 373 (96 target + 277 lost) to trick the OR engine into placing a replenishment order of ~20 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in a stable summer demand regime for this light cotton-blend jumper. Recent demand (Periods 11-15: 25, 44, 43, 38, 39) shows a mean of ~38 units/week. The inventory situation is critical: we are at 0 on-hand inventory. The total 'In-transit' of 341 is highly misleading because 277 units from early orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost (legacy shipments over 10 weeks old). Only the orders from P14 (43 units) and P15 (20 units) are realistically expected to arrive. Since the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the base stock calculation, and it 'sees' 341 units in transit, it will fail to order anything if I use default settings. I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to force a high enough base stock to overcome this phantom inventory. With an actual L=2, the base stock targets 3 periods (L+1) of demand. Target base stock = 3 * 38 = 114. To ensure the engine orders roughly 40-50 units today to replenish stock despite the 341 phantom units, I will set an explicit mu_hat that brings the base stock above the in-transit mask. However, the OR backend capped policy also limits the order based on mu_hat/(1+L). Therefore, I'll set L to the promised 2 and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to capture current volatility, but use an explicit mu_hat for the base stock calculation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3 (early summer). The product is a women's jumper, which is currently in a low-demand summer season. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 42 units/week over the last 3 periods (P14: 38, P15: 39, P16: 42). The supply chain is complex: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 277 units) are confirmed lost as they are now 12+ weeks overdue. Recent successful deliveries (P9 arrived in 1 period, P12 arrived in 2 periods) suggest a returned stability to the promised lead time of L=2. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 450 units is heavily inflated by the 277 lost units. Current active pipeline consists of orders from P14 (43 units, due P16/17), P15 (20 units, due P17/18), and P16 (109 units, due P18/19). The 109 units ordered last period represent a significant over-order relative to summer demand, likely triggered by the backend seeing 0 on-hand and high lost demand. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the stable summer baseline of ~40 units/week. To prevent further excessive ordering while on-hand is 0, I will use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect lower summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline update: Mean demand for June remains stable at ~40 units/week (last 3 periods 38-42). Legacy lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) remain in pipeline count, causing OR backend to potentially under-order if not compensated for by higher mu_hat or lower L, though currently, the backend has over-ordered (109 units in P16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), we are in the summer demand regime for this cotton-blend jumper. Recent demand has stabilized at lower levels, with the last 4 periods (P14-P17) showing demand of 38, 39, 42, and 18. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 36 units/week. Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P9, P12, P15, P16) have been 1, 2, 2, and 1 periods respectively, confirming the supply chain has recovered to the promised L=2 or better. However, there is a major data integrity issue: 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 321 units, but at least 277 of these (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost legacy shipments. Since the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation, it will stop ordering entirely if we don't adjust. To force the backend to maintain a healthy inventory levels given we have 111 on-hand (approx 3 weeks of stock) and a misleadingly high pipeline, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the current demand regime (~36 units/week) and covers the review + lead time (3 periods) regardless of the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand baseline update: Mean demand for June transitioned from ~40 to ~30 (recent P17 demand was 18). Pipeline inflation confirmed: 277 units in 'In-transit' are lost legacy orders from P1-P4.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 17, 2019 (Period 19), we are in a low-demand summer season for knitwear. Recent demand (Periods 17-18) has dropped further to an average of 20 units/week. Inventory is currently high with 89 units on-hand, which covers over 4 periods of the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 321 units is significantly inflated by 277 units from legacy orders (Periods 1, 3, 4) that are confirmed lost. However, even accounting for the lost units, the active pipeline includes 43 units (from P14) which haven't arrived yet but are likely still in transit. Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' (321) to calculate base stock, it will naturally order 0 until this ghost inventory is consumed. Given we already have 89 units on-hand (a ~4-week supply), the backend ordering 0 is actually the desired outcome to avoid further holding costs during this summer lull. I will set the demand parameters to reflect the recent low-demand regime (mu_hat based on last 4 weeks ~30 units/week) and use the calculated lead time to maintain stability.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand low-point: June demand has settled at approximately 20-30 units/week (last 2 periods avg 20).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 20 (late June). The SKU (580770001, cotton rib-knit jumper) is in a summer low-demand phase. Demand for the last three periods has been 18, 22, and 13 (mean \u2248 17.7). On-hand inventory is 76 units, which is high relative to current demand. The 'In-transit' count of 321 units remains heavily inflated by 277 units of 'lost' legacy orders (P1, P3, P4) that have not arrived for over 15 periods. Excluding these, the true active pipeline is 44 units (likely the P14 order or remnants). Total effective inventory (On-hand 76 + Active Pipeline 44 = 120) is roughly 5-6 weeks of stock at current demand levels. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom 'lost' inventory in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly high enough to ensure the capped policy doesn't zero out orders, while keeping L at the promised 2 periods to reflect recent lead time behavior (P15 at L=2, P16 at L=1). I'll forecast a weekly demand mean of 20 and use recent_N for sigma to capture volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand low-point (Late June): Demand has dropped to ~18 units/week (last 3 periods avg). Pipeline inflation of 277 units (P1, P3, P4) persists.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in the peak of summer for the 'Kai Jumper' (knitwear). Demand has transitioned from the spring decline to a stable summer low-point, with recent demand across Periods 17-20 being 18, 22, 13, and 12 units respectively (average ~16.25). The pipeline inventory (321 units) remains heavily inflated by 277 units from Period 1, 3, and 4 which are long since lost. The only 'real' recent shipment from P16 has arrived. Current on-hand inventory is 64 units, which is significantly more than needed to cover the current demand rate (L+1 = 3 weeks of demand at ~17 units/week is ~51 units). Because of the 277 phantom units in 'In-transit', the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction would normally prevent any ordering; however, even without that, our on-hand inventory is sufficient. To ensure the backend doesn't over-react to the low demand while also attempting to 'zero out' the effect of lost shipments, I will set mu_hat to be explicit based on the recent summer average (17 units * 3 = 51) and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower volatility. This keeps the base stock near the current on-hand level.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor reached: Weekly demand for knitwear in July is ~17 units (Periods 17-20 avg). Pipeline still includes 277 units of lost legacy inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for the Kai jumper (a knitwear item) has hit a summer low, with the most recent demand being only 4 units. Over the last 4 periods (P18-P21), demand averaged 12.75 units, significantly lower than the previous summer baseline of ~17-20 units. On-hand inventory is currently 60 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by 277 units (from P1, P3, and P4) which have been confirmed lost for over 15 periods. To prevent the OR backend from considering this ghost inventory and potentially under-ordering in the future (though we are currently overstocked), I must continue to keep mu_hat explicitly high or use a strategy that ignores the stale pipeline. However, since on-hand inventory (60) is already well above the required base stock for this demand regime (Base Stock ~ (1+2)*13 = 39), no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current demand floor of ~13 units, and keep L at default as recent arrivals (P15, P16) were on time or early.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor updated: July demand has reached a minimum of ~13 units/week (Periods 18-21 avg). On-hand inventory of 60 units is currently sufficient for ~5 weeks.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, representing the peak of summer for the 'Kai jumper' (a knitwear product). Demand has stabilized at a low summer floor, with the last five periods (P18-P22) averaging 15 units/week (22, 13, 12, 4, 24). On-hand inventory is 36 units, which covers approximately 2.4 weeks of current demand. A significant issue remains: 277 units from Period 1, 3, and 4 are still listed as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost (they are >18 weeks overdue). This 'pipeline inflation' tricks the OR backend into thinking we have excessive stock coming, which would prevent it from ordering when needed. However, since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the engine will aim to keep inventory exactly at the expected demand (mu_hat). To counteract the 277 lost units and ensure the backend eventually orders when stock hits zero, I will set mu_hat using the recent low-demand regime (N=5) to reflect current summer levels (~15/week). L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P15, P16, P12) show the supply chain has stabilized near the promised lead time of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor persists: Periods 18-22 average demand is ~15 units/week. Lost legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4) still total 277 units in pipeline inventory.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, representing the peak of summer for the 'Kai jumper' (women's knitwear). Demand has reached its seasonal floor, with the last 6 periods averaging ~15 units/week (18, 22, 13, 12, 4, 24, 17). The 'In-transit' quantity of 321 units is severely inflated by 277 units from lost legacy orders (P1, P3, P4). Adjusted pipeline = 321 - 277 = 44 units. These 44 units represent the order from P14 (43 units) which is now 10 weeks overdue and also likely lost. Effectively, the pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 19 units, which covers approximately one week of demand. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'In-transit' ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to a value that exceeds on-hand + inflated in-transit (19 + 321 = 340). I set mu_hat to 350 to trigger a small replenishment order for the upcoming late summer/early autumn transition, while using L=2 (promised) to match recent successful delivery windows (P10, P14, P17).

Carry-over insight: P14 order (43 units) is now 10 weeks overdue and confirmed lost, increasing total lost legacy shipments to 320 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a women's jumper, which is currently in a summer demand low-point. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 13.6 units/week. On-hand inventory is 8 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 331 units is significantly inflated by 320 units of lost legacy shipments (P1: 213, P3: 28, P4: 36, P14: 43). Only the P24 order of 11 units should be considered active in the pipeline. To ensure the OR backend places an order to cover upcoming demand despite the false 'in-transit' count, I will use the 'explicit' method. I am setting L=2 (promised). Target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand plus a small safety buffer. With mean demand at ~14, mu_hat is set to 50 (approx 16.6 units/week across 3 periods) and sigma_hat is set to 15 to ensure a high service level given the low stock (8 units). This will force an order because (base_stock 50 - pipeline 331) would result in zero, but the backend's 'cap' mechanism will allow a small replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Pipeline inflation persists with 320 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P14). Summer demand floor for knitwear is stable at ~14 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26 (August 5th). The product is a women's rib-knit cotton blend jumper. Demand has bottomed out during the summer months, with the most recent 5-period average (P21-P25) being approximately 13.6 units/week. We reached zero on-hand inventory at the end of Period 25. The total pipeline 'In-transit' of 331 units is highly inflated due to lost legacy orders (P1: 213, P3: 28, P4: 36, P14: 43), totaling 320 lost units. The only truly active order is 11 units from Period 24. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory (320 units that will never arrive), I must set mu_hat using the explicit method. I will target a base stock level that ignores the lost 320 units. Based on current demand of ~14 units and a lead time of 2, a safe base stock is roughly (2+1)*14 = 42. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (331) from base_stock, I must provide a mu_hat that compensates for this: My 'virtual' base stock needs to be 331 + desired units. However, to avoid a massive over-order, I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting current demand while keeping L at default (2) to ensure we maintain small, frequent orders as we approach the autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 26, total lost legacy shipments remain at 320 units (P1, P3, P4, P14). Demand floor for knitwear in late summer is stable at ~14 units/week. Incoming autumn transition should be monitored for demand upticks in the next 2-4 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are entering the mid-August transition for this 'soft, rib-knit cotton blend' jumper. Historically, demand was at its floor (~14 units/week) throughout July, but Period 26 saw a significant jump to 41 units, signaling the start of the autumn demand recovery as consumers prepare for cooler weather. The 'In-transit' pipeline remains severely inflated by 320 units from lost legacy orders (P1, P3, P4, P14). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet both the rising demand and compensate for the 320 phantom units it thinks are coming, I will use 'explicit' methods. For mu_hat, I'll set a value that covers the rising demand (transitioning from 14 towards 40-50) over the (L+1) period window. With L=2, (1+2)*45 = 135. However, since the OR engine subtracts the 380 units in transit (of which only P24=10 and P26=49 are real) from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to bypass the pipeline deduction. To clear a ~320 unit deficit and provide ~45 units/week coverage, the target base stock needs to be ~450+. I will set mu_hat to 450 and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the higher volatility seen during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition confirmed: Period 26 demand spiked to 41 units (from a July average of ~14), signaling the end of the summer low-point and the start of the high-demand season for knitwear.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now entering the Autumn peak for knitwear (product 580770001, cotton rib-knit jumper). Period 26 and 27 demand (41 and 53 units respectively) confirms an upward trend from the summer floor (~14 units), as expected for August. A critical accounting issue persists: the 'In-transit' quantity of 450 units is heavily inflated by 320 units of confirmed lost legacy shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 14). Excluding those, the true active pipeline is much smaller (49 units from P26 + 70 units from P27 + 10 units from P24). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 320 lost units as available and under-ordering during this seasonal ramp-up, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand for the next (L+1=3) periods based on the current uptrend (averaging ~50 units/week), totaling 150 units. I am maintaining L at default (2) as recent active shipments arrive with L=1 or L=2. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility of a seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition accelerating: Demand increased from ~14 to ~50 units/week over the last two periods (P26-P27). Lost legacy shipments remain at 320 units, inflating the 'In-transit' count and requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments to avoid stockouts during the peak season.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is August 26, 2019. We are in the midst of a significant autumn demand transition for product 580770001 (women's knitwear). Demand has surged from a July low of ~14 units/week to a three-week average of 49.3 units (41, 53, 54). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the past three weeks. The pipeline shows 450 units 'in-transit', but 320 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 14) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The remaining 130 units (ordered Periods 24, 26, 27) are active. The OR backend subtracts the full 450 units from its base stock calculation. To force an order and satisfy the rising autumn demand, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 320 units of 'phantom' inventory. By setting mu_hat using an explicit value based on a (1+L) projection of recent demand (~50 * 3 = 150) plus the 320 lost units, I can ensure the backend recognizes the need for stock. I choose L=explicit=2 to reflect promised lead time as recent active shipments (P15, P16) arrived at L=2 or L=1.

Carry-over insight: Autumn Demand Surge: Knitwear demand has shifted from ~14 to ~50 units/week (+250%) over the last 3 periods. Total lost legacy shipments remains 320 units (P1, P3, P4, P14), continuing to inflate total pipeline inventory and requiring mu_hat compensation.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (early September). The 'Autumn Demand Surge' is confirmed, with demand for women's knitwear jumping from a summer low of ~14 units to an average of ~49 units/week over the last 4 periods (41, 53, 54, 48). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 470 units, but 320 units (P1, P3, P4, P14) are confirmed lost legacy shipments. Additionally, orders from P26 (49 units), P27 (70 units), P29 (20 units), and P30 (unknown) are still in transit. Given the promised Lead Time (L) is 2, the P26 and P27 orders (119 units) are currently overdue (observed at 4 and 3 periods respectively), suggesting a possible supply bottleneck or slightly longer actual lead time. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the 50+ unit/week demand despite being 'fooled' by the 320 lost units in the pipeline calculation, I will use an explicit mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 200 (approx 50 units * (L+1)) and keep L at default to maintain a consistent ordering pressure. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed at ~50 units/week (Periods 26-29 avg). Supply delay: P26/P27 orders overdue by 1-2 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn demand season for the 'Kai jumper' (knitwear). Period 30 saw a massive demand surge to 126 units, significantly higher than the previous autumn average of 50. This spike likely reflects early September seasonality. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 400 is heavily inflated by 320 units of confirmed lost legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14). The only 'active' orders in the pipeline are from P26 (49 units), P29 (20 units), and whatever is ordered now. Since P26 is already 4 periods old and hasn't arrived, lead times are stretching or shipments are failing. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect recent arrival from P27 and current delays. To compensate for the 320 phantom units in the OR backend's 'Pipeline Inventory' calculation and to meet the surging demand (mean ~70 over last 5 periods: 41, 53, 54, 48, 126), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Base stock needs to cover (L+1)=4 periods. 4 * 70 = 280 units. However, because the backend will subtract the 320 'In-transit' units from any base stock calculation, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is actually placed. I'll set mu_hat to 650 (intended base stock ~300 + ~350 to offset the phantom pipeline) to trigger a replenishment that fills the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand Surge: Period 30 demand (126 units) suggests a higher autumn peak than previously estimated (avg >70 units/week). Lead Time Volatility: P27 arrived (L=3), but P26 (49 units) is still missing after 4 periods, indicating potential for further loss or L=5+.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn demand phase for women's knitwear. Recent demand (P30: 126, P31: 129) shows a massive surge compared to the summer floor of ~14. The average demand of the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is ~75 units/week. However, current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 612 units is heavily inflated by 320 units from lost legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14) and 49 units from P26 which is now 6 periods overdue and also potentially lost. To allow the OR backend to place an order despite this false 612-unit pipeline, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of 110 units/week over a (L+1=3) period window, totaling 330. By setting mu_hat to 720 (330 units true demand + 390 units to neutralize lost pipeline), I force the logic to recognize the need for more stock. Sigma_hat is set to 40 (explicit) to account for high volatility during this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 30-31 demand averaged 127 units/week, drastically higher than the initial autumn transition estimate of 50. P26 order (49 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing total legacy lost units to 369.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 580770001 (women's knit jumper) has fully transitioned into its autumn peak season. While demand shifted from ~14 to ~50 units/week in August, September demand has intensified significantly, with the last three periods (P30-P32) averaging 111 units/week (126, 129, 80). There is a persistent supply chain issue: total 'In-transit' is 508, but 369 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26). The OR backend's automated ordering will be severely suppressed by this 'phantom' inventory unless compensated. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the current 100+ unit/week demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + promised_L) * current_demand_trend = (1 + 2) * 115 = 345. I use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the autumn surge (N=6 to cover the transition). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to integrate the mix of short (L=1, P31) and long (L=3, P27) recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 30-32 demand averaged 111 units/week (up from early autumn estimate of 50). Total confirmed lost legacy shipments now 369 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn demand period for this knitwear product (late September). Recent demand (Periods 30-33) has averaged approximately 113 units per week, significantly higher than the earlier autumn transition estimate. On-hand inventory is low (14 units) after satisfying 118 units of demand in P33. The 'In-transit' count of 508 is highly inflated by lost orders: P1 (213), P3 (28), P4 (36), P14 (43), and P26 (49), totaling 369 units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 139 units (mostly from P32). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 508 from its base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a higher order volume. I will set mu_hat based on the current mean (~113) multiplied by (1+L), then add the 369 lost units as a 'phantom' demand to neutralize the pipeline inflation. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*113 + 369 = 708. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for recent high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost legacy shipments now 369 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26), causing significant pipeline inflation. Autumn peak demand for the Kai jumper is now established at a mean of ~113 units/week (Periods 30-33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a women's knit jumper entering October (peak autumn demand). Demand from Periods 30-34 averaged ~90 units/week (despite a lower Period 34 demand of 46 units, which may be an outlier or affected by stockouts). Current on-hand is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 694 is heavily inflated by 369 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26). Active pipeline is approximately 325 units (P29: 20, P32: 108, P34: 186). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficiently to cover the autumn peak while ignoring the legacy lost shipments, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 110 units/week for the L+1 window (3 periods). mu_hat = 3 * 110 = 330. I use an 'explicit' L=2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P31 at L=1, P27 at L=3) suggest an average near 2. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent autumn volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed total lost units in 'In-transit' is 369 (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26). Recent demand (P30-P34) remains high, averaging ~90 per week, consistent with autumn seasonality.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 14, 2019. We are in the peak autumn/winter season for knitwear. Recent demand (P30-P35) has been volatile but high, averaging approximately 91 units/week (126, 129, 80, 118, 46, 48). The lower demand in the last two periods (46, 48) suggests a cooling from the initial Sept surge or potential stockout-influenced data, but we must maintain a high baseline to avoid lost sales during this peak. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 586) is heavily inflated by 418 units from lost orders (P1=213, P3=28, P4=36, P14=43, P26=49, P29=20, totaling 409 confirmed lost/overdue; P29 is 6 weeks overdue and P26 is 9 weeks overdue). With 60 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of only ~186 (P34 order), we need to ensure the OR backend orders enough by adjusting mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover a demand of 90 units/week for 3 periods (L=2 + 1), totaling 270. Since L is set to default (2), mu_hat = (1+L)*30 would be too low; I will use explicit to force high coverage despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed lost shipments updated to 409 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29). Demand during autumn peak (Oct) currently stabilizes at ~90 units/week despite minor recent dips.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the autumn/early winter season for knitwear. Although demand has dipped slightly in the last two periods (48 and 18), the previous month (Sept) showed a very high peak averaging ~100+ units/week. The low demand in Period 36 (18 units) may be an outlier or a temporary lull before finishing the season. Pipeline inventory is significantly inflated by 409 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29). Actual 'living' pipeline is the P34 order of 186 units. With 42 units on-hand and 186 in-transit (total 228), and a recent 7-period average demand of ~70, we are covered for ~3 weeks. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 409 lost units in the pipeline, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a higher base stock requirement, while maintaining a recent N for sigma to handle the high volatility observed in Sept.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total confirmed lost shipments increased to 409 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29). Autumn demand volatility is high, with a Sept peak of ~110 followed by an Oct dip to ~30-40.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late October. Demand for the Kai jumper has cooled significantly from the September peak (which averaged ~113 units/week) to a more moderate October pace of ~30 units/week (last 3 periods: 46, 18, 26). The total 'In-transit' of 586 is heavily inflated by lost legacy shipments. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, and P29 (totaling 409 units) are significantly overdue and confirmed/highly likely lost. Excluding these, the active pipeline consists of P31 (arrived), P32 (arrived), and P34 (186 units ordered 4 weeks ago, currently overdue). Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the October demand stabilization at ~30 units/week. To account for the 409 lost units inflating the pipeline (which would cause the OR backend to under-order), I will set an explicit mu_hat that is significantly higher than the actual predicted demand, effectively 'hiding' the lost inventory from the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total confirmed lost shipments now 409 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29). October demand has stabilized at ~30 units/week, down from the September peak of ~110.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), we are in the heart of the autumn/winter peak for knitwear. Recent demand has fluctuated, but the last several weeks (P34-P38) show a mean of ~36 units/week, down from the extreme September peak (~110). However, on-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure (586 units) is heavily inflated by 409 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29). Subtracting these, the real pipeline contains the P34 order (186 units), which is now overdue (ordered P34, lead time was 3 in some recent cases, but it's now 5 periods since order). To compensate for the 409 missing units which the OR engine incorrectly counts as available inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating target stock: Expected demand (L+1=3 weeks) \xd7 recent avg (36) = 108 units. To force the OR backend to order despite the 409 units of phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat to approximately [Demand * (L+1)] + Lost Units. 108 + 409 = 517. I will use 520 to ensure a robust order to replenish the currently 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed lost shipments reached 409 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29). November demand baseline for the Kai jumper is approximately 35-40 units/week following the September peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (Nov 11), we are entering the mid-to-late autumn season for this women's sweater. Current demand has cooled significantly from the September peak (~110) to a more stable November baseline of approximately 30-40 units per week (the last 4 periods average ~26). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 586 is highly inflated due to 409 units of confirmed lost legacy shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 26, 29). Subtracting these lost units leaves a likely active pipeline of 177 units (almost all from the P34 order of 186 units, minus small arrivals). However, the OR backend sees 586 units and will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the backend places an order to meet the current demand of ~30/week despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast. With average LT=2, 3 periods of demand at ~35 units/week = 105. To offset the 409 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 514 (105 + 409). This forces the engine to recognize a need for physical stock. Sigma_hat is set to cover the moderate volatility observed in the last 4 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the Kai jumper (knitwear) is in its late-autumn phase. Demand has cooled significantly from the September peak (~110) and is now averaging approximately 15-20 units/week based on the last two periods (17 and 14). There is currently zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 586 is highly inflated by 409 units of confirmed lost legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29). Subtracting these lost units, the 'real' pipeline consists of the P34 order (186 units), which is now 7 periods overdue, suggesting L=7+ or a new lost shipment. However, the immediate goal is to prevent stockouts if the P34 order remains lost. Since profit = holding cost, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. To compensate for the 409 lost units being counted as 'in-transit' by the backend, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate 'real' demand at 20 units/week. Over (L+1)=3 periods, that is 60 units. To offset the 409 'phantom' units, I set mu_hat to 469 (409 + 60). This forces the backend to recognize that existing pipeline does not satisfy actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Pipeline inflation confirmed at 409 units lost (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29). Period 34 order (186 units) is now 7 periods overdue, potentially increasing lost units to 595 if not arrived by next period. Current demand baseline is ~20 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 580770001 (women's knit jumper) has entered a late-autumn/early-winter low-demand phase, with demand steadily declining from its September peak (~110) to a current baseline of ~12-14 units/week (last 3 periods avg). Pipeline inflation is severe: 595 units are currently considered lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29, and now P34 which is 8 weeks overdue). The 'In-transit' count of 586 units is composed entirely of these lost shipments, meaning the OR backend believes we are heavily overstocked when we actually have zero on-hand inventory. To force the backend to place a small replenishment order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' high value. A value of 650 (approx 595 lost units + 3 weeks of safety stock at 15 units/week) is required to offset the pipeline inflation and trigger a small order. I am keeping L at 'default' (2) as recent non-lost shipments (P31, P32) arrived with L=1-3, and \u03c3\u0302 is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Pipeline inflation officially increased to 595 units as P34 (186 units) is now 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Current demand regime is stable at ~15 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 580770001 (women's knit jumper) has entered a low-demand winter baseline (Dec/Jan), with recent demand averaging ~10 units/week (last 4 periods: 17, 14, 12, 3). The pipeline is severely inflated with 595 units of lost legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29, P34). Current 'In-transit' shows 650 units, but only the P42 order (64 units) is likely active. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the pipeline inflation. I set mu_hat based on the current stable demand of ~10 units/week across the L+1 window (3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to account for recent volatility. This prevents the OR engine from stopping orders due to the 595 ghost units while avoiding excessive inventory during a season where this product typically has low turnover.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (early December). Demand for the Kai jumper has settled into a low winter regime, averaging ~8 units/week over the last 4 periods (P40-P43). The 'In-transit' count of 650 is severely inflated by multiple lost legacy shipments: P1 (213), P3 (28), P4 (36), P14 (43), P26 (49), P29 (20), and P34 (186), totaling 575 units. Subtracting these from the current 650 in-transit units yields 75 units actually in the pipeline (recent P42 order of 64 plus minor residuals). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 650+ units and deciding not to order during future demand shifts, I must maintain an explicit mu_hat that covers real demand while accounting for the invisible inventory hole created by lost orders. Since on-hand is 0 and we are entering the final weeks of the year, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low demand baseline (~10/week) and use default lead time L=2, as more recent successful deliveries (P32, P31) showed recovery from the extreme P3-P8 delays, though reliability remains poor.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative confirmed lost shipments increased to 575 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29, P34). Current winter demand is very low, averaging ~8 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16, which is mid-winter. Demand for this knit jumper has reached a seasonal low, averaging ~8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). Pipeline inventory ('In-transit') is currently 650 units, but a significant portion is confirmed lost: P1 (213), P3 (28), P4 (36), P14 (43), P26 (49), P29 (20), and P34 (186). This totals 575 units of 'lost' inventory still being counted by the backend. The true effective pipeline consists only of the P42 order (64 units). On-hand inventory is 0. To prevent the OR backend from severely under-estimating requirements due to the inflated 575 lost units while simultaneously recognizing the very low current demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 (promised), that is 3 periods. At 8 units/week, we need a base stock of ~24. However, the OR engine will subtract 650 from that target, resulting in no order. To force a small replenishment to address the current stockout (On-hand: 0), I will set mu_hat to 660. This will effectively tell the backend: 'I need 660 total units (575 lost + 64 in-transit + 21 on-hand)'. This should result in a small order of roughly 10-20 units to cover immediate demand while acknowledging that the 575 legacy units are never arriving.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Demand for the Kai jumper (knitwear) has hit its winter low, with recent periods showing very low sales (P42-P45: 3, 5, 4, 2 units). The mean demand for this regime is approximately 4 units/week. Lead times are averaging L=3 (P42 arrived in P45). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 596 units is severely inflated by lost legacy shipments totaling 575 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29, P34). Only 21 units (P45 order of 10 plus potential residuals) are truly active units. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current winter low demand (approx 4 units/week) based on the last 4 samples (N=4) to ensure the OR backend does not over-order while we have 62 units on hand, which is more than enough for the remainder of the winter season.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (late December), the demand for the Kai jumper is at its seasonal low, with demand over the last four periods being extremely minimal (2, 1, 1, 0 estimated). The product's 'In-transit' figure of 596 units is heavily inflated by lost legacy shipments: P1 (213), P3 (28), P4 (36), P14 (43), P26 (49), P29 (20), and P34 (186), totaling 575 units. Subtracting these from the 596 in-transit units reveals an active pipeline of approximately 21 units (P45 order). Current on-hand inventory is 61 units, which is more than sufficient given the current demand regime of ~2-5 units per week. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 42-46) to reflect this winter baseline and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering due to the high-demand autumn history or the large (but lost) pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Current inventory (61 units) is sufficient for the remainder of the winter low-demand period (avg ~3 units/week). Cumulative confirmed lost shipments: 575 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P26, P29, P34) continue to inflate the 'In-transit' count.
