Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a 'Maja Cardigan', a soft, loose knit cardigan. The historical demand for the last 5 weeks is [1, 6, 7, 5, 5], showing an average demand of 4.8 units per week. The date (mid-February) is toward the end of winter/beginning of spring in many regions, but knitwear typically remains relevant through early spring. No lead time data is available yet, so I will use the promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat, I will use all 5 available historical samples to establish a baseline demand. Since L=2, mu_hat will represent (1+2=3) periods of demand. Mean = 4.8, so mu_hat = 4.8 * 3 = 14.4. Sigma_hat will be estimated from the available history (std dev approx 2.28), so sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 2.28 approx 3.95.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the product (Maja Cardigan - Knitwear) and historical demand, there is a significant surge. Demand was [1, 6, 7, 5, 5] leading up to Feb 4th, but jumped to 18 in Period 1 (Feb 11th). This likely reflects a seasonal transition or promotion for mid-February. The promised lead time is 2. An order of 9 was placed in Period 1, which remains in-transit. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is high, we need to set parameters to recover inventory quickly. The average demand of the last 5 samples was 4.8, but Period 1 was 18. Taking a recent average of the last 3 visible samples (7, 5, 18) gives ~10 units/period. For mu_hat, I will use (1+L)*10 = 3*10 = 30. For sigma_hat, the volatility has increased with this spike, so I will use an explicit value to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficiently large base stock to cover the stockout.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This 'Maja Cardigan' is a knitwear item. Looking at global inventory and history, we observe a significant demand surge starting in late February. Period 1 demand was 18, but Period 2 demand spiked to 79. Historical pre-game samples (Jan/early Feb) were much lower (avg ~5). This indicates a strong seasonal regime shift as we enter the transitional spring season. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 31 units in-transit (9 units ordered in P1, 22 units ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4). Given the massive demand spike in P2, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg 48.5 per week), while acknowledging that a cap will likely be applied by the OR backend. The goal is to aggressively restock to meet the new demand level while we wait for the pipeline to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 2: demand surged from an average of ~5-18 to 79, likely due to seasonal transition for knitwear.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a knitwear cardigan, and we've observed a significant demand jump starting in Period 2 (79 units) and continuing in Period 3 (56 units), compared to the initial single-digit historical samples. This confirms the seasonal regime shift noted in carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 151 units (orders from P1, P2, P3). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (9 units) was expected to arrive in P3 (conclude) but has not yet appeared. However, per the instructions, an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3's arrival phase and is first visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of P4. The Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, suggesting the P1 order (ordered Feb 11) is potentially late or the actual lead time is naturally longer than 2. Given we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and demand is high, I will set mu_hat using the recent 3 periods (P1-P3) to capture the higher mean (approx 51 units/period), and keep L at default (2) for now to see if arrivals consolidate in the next period's report. If P1 and P2 orders do not arrive by Period 5 conclude, I will adjust L to 'explicit' to account for delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/03/11). The product is a 'Maja Cardigan' (Knitwear), which has seen a significant demand shift since early February (Period 2). Historical demand for the last four periods has been 18, 79, 56, and 71, averaging 56 units per week. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 4, the order from Period 2 arrived exactly after 2 periods, confirming that the lead time is currently stable at 2. However, we have experienced stockouts every period because on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is significantly outstripping the historical mean from Jan/early Feb. We currently have 219 units in transit (orders from P3 and P4). To calculate the base stock for the OR backend, I will use a period of 4 (N=4) for the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this new 'knitwear season' regime, covering the lead time plus the review period (L+1=3).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). Demand regime stable at ~56 units/week since Period 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing the 'Maja Cardigan'. We are experiencing significant stockouts due to high demand and the 2-period lead time delay. Demand analysis: Samples are (1, 6, 7, 5, 5) pre-game, and (18, 79, 56, 71, 88) during the game. The demand regime shifted at Period 2, coinciding with the typical seasonal peak for knitwear in spring. Since Period 2, demand has averaged 73.5 units/week. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). Order reconciliation: P3 order (120 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 6 arrival resolution phase (visible in P7 conclude), and P4 order (90 units) in P7. On-hand is currently 0, with 246 units in transit (120 + 90 + 27 + 9 - noting the P1 order of 9 is missing/lost as it should have arrived in P3). I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime from Periods 2-5, and default for L as the promised lead time holds.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (9 units) remains lost/missing as of Period 6 (expected P3). High-demand regime (avg 73.5) sustained from Period 2 (Feb 18) through Period 5 (Mar 11).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is in a high-demand spring regime. The current date is March 25th. Since Period 2, demand has consistently exceeded earlier levels, with recent observations of 71, 88, and 105 units (mean = 88.0). Inventory health is critical: On-hand is 0, and the P1 order (9 units) and P3 order (120 units) are significantly delayed or lost. Order P3 was placed 4 periods ago (Promised L=2) and has not arrived, suggesting a disruption. However, order P5 arrived in just 1 period. To stabilize, I am setting L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering due to temporary variability, but setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the upward demand trend (avg ~88). This results in a mu_hat of (1+2)*88 = 264. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the high volatility (std ~17) during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Significant lead time variability observed: P3 (120 units) is overdue by 2 periods; P5 arrived early (L=1). Demand trend is increasing: last 3 periods avg 88 units (+20% vs Previous regime).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for the Maja Cardigan (Knitwear), with demand increasing over the last 4 periods (71, 88, 105, 110). The average demand over the last 4 periods is 93.5 units. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have significant pipeline issues. Specifically, P1 (9 units) is lost, and P3 (120 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P3, expected P5, now P8 START), and P4 (90 units) is also 1 period overdue. Given the high demand and pipeline instability, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the (L+1) window using the recent average of 93.5. With L=2, the total expected demand is 280.5. I am choosing L='calculate' to allow the backend to use the history (which includes a mix of L=2 and L=1), but I must account for the high volatility in arrivals by using an 'explicit' sigma_hat set to approximately 25% of the mu_hat to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock to buffer against these delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: last 4 periods average 93.5 units (+67% vs early Feb regime). Pipeline instability: Order P3 (120 units) is now 3 periods overdue; order P4 (90 units) is 1 period overdue.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. We are in a high-growth seasonal period for this knitwear item (Maja Cardigan). Demand has surged significantly: the last 4 periods average 116 units, and the most recent demand reached 161 units (a +46% jump from the previous week). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have lost several older shipments (P1, P3, and P4 are all significantly past their expected arrival dates, totaling 219 lost units). The 'In-transit' figure is 302, but this includes these likely lost units; specifically, orders from P3 (120) and P4 (90) have not arrived despite the promised L=2 and later orders (P5, P6, P7) already arriving. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock, the presence of these 'phantom' units in the pipeline is preventing the system from ordering enough to meet the new demand level. Lead times are volatile (1-2 periods), so I will use an explicit L=2 to be safe. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value based on the recent trend (avg of last 3 periods: 125 units) to ensure the base stock (1+L)*demand covers current needs. Sigma_hat is set high to account for the extreme volatility and recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand accelerated into April: last 4 periods avg 116 units vs 88 units in March. Shipment loss confirmed for large early orders: P3 (120 units) and P4 (90 units) are at least 4 periods overdue and likely lost, causing systemic under-ordering due to phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Date: 2019/4/15. We are in a high-demand spring phase for knitwear (Maja Cardigan). Demand has accelerated significantly: the last 4 periods average ~121 units (71, 105, 110, 161, 108), excluding the peak of 161. Pipeline inventory is severely compromised: Orders P1 (9), P3 (120), and P4 (90) totaling 219 units are effectively lost (overdue by 7, 5, and 4 periods respectively). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' quantity from its calculation, we must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 219 'phantom' units. My forecast for one week is 120 units. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (L+1) periods = 360 units. To neutralize the 219 phantom units, I adjust mu_hat to 360 + 219 = 579. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover real demand despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P5, P6, P7) showed lead times of 1-2 periods, but P1, P3, and P4 are missing.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at a higher tier in April: average ~121 units/week (+37% vs March avg of ~88). Massive pipeline failure confirmed: 219 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, requiring explicit parameter inflation to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22). The product is a soft cardigan (knitwear), which is hitting peak spring demand in April. Historical demand from Period 7-10 shows a high-volume steady state (110, 161, 108, 77), averaging 114 units/week. While demand dipped to 77 in Period 10, the previous period had a stockout (arrived 0), likely resulting in lost sales or shifting demand. I'll use the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this April demand plateau. Lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P8 took 2, P9 took 1); I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time. A critical issue remains: 219 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' count (419 units total). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory (419) from the base stock. To prevent the system from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units, I must use the 'explicit' method to inflate mu_hat. Expected demand over (L+1) = 3 periods is ~342. Adding 219 phantom units results in a target mu_hat of ~561. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover actual demand despite the pipeline data corruption.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (Apr 29), we are in a high-demand regime for the Maja Cardigan. While demand spiked to 161 in April, it has since settled: the most recent three periods (P9-P11) averaged 100.3 units/week. However, our main challenge remains 'phantom inventory'. Previous carry-over insights confirmed that orders from P1 (9 units), P3 (120 units), and P4 (90 units) are lost, totaling 219 units. The backend OR engine counts these 219 units as 'In-transit', preventing it from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecasted_Demand + Lost_Volume. With L=2, (1+2)*110 + 219 = 549. This ensures the base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the 219 missing units. I used 110 as the forecast to slightly buffer against the late April volatility. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the high variability seen throughout April.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued in late April: the last 3 periods (P9-P11) averaged ~100 units/week, down from the early April peak of 161 but significantly higher than March's ~88.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU 679854001 (Knitwear) is in a high-demand phase following an April peak. Demand over the last 4 periods (P9-P12) averaged 109.5 units (108, 77, 116, 137). There is significant pipeline instability. Confirmed lost orders from earlier periods (P1: 9, P3: 120, P4: 90) total 219 units; these 'phantom units' still reside in the OR backend's pipeline inventory, which would suppress new orders unless offset. On-hand is currently 0. In-transit shows 589 units; however, subtracting the 219 lost units leaves a real pipeline of 370 units (P10: 200, P11: 80, P12: 90). The P10 order (200 units) is expected to arrive this period (P13) if lead time is 3 or next period if longer. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the forecasted demand of ~110 units/week across the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) and to combat the 219-unit under-ordering bias caused by lost shipments, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 550. This represents (110 * 3) + 220 to force the backend to ignore the phantom inventory. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised), as recent arrivals (P8, P9) showed L=1 or 2, despite some earlier delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains strong into May, averaging ~110 units/week over the last 4 periods. The 219 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost, requiring target stock inflation to offset phantom pipeline inventory in the OR engine.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (May 13), we are managing a soft knitwear item (Maja Cardigan) which continues to show strong late-spring demand. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is 99 units. However, there is a major systemic issue: 219 units from orders P1 (9), P3 (120), and P4 (90) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they persist in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation (part of the 560 units shown). This creates 'phantom inventory' that prevents the OR engine from ordering enough units. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock needed to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units: (110 units/week * 3 weeks) + 219 lost units = 549 units. Setting mu_hat to 549 effectively forces the backend to ignore the lost pipeline units when calculating the reorder quantity. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current volatility of this higher-demand regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (May 20), we continue to manage the 'Maja Cardigan', which is in a high-demand regime as we approach late spring. Demand over the last 4 periods (P11-P14) has averaged 108.25 units/week, despite volatility (range 66-137). A major operational constraint is the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline: 219 units from early orders (P1, P3, P4) are definitively lost but still count against our base stock in the backend OR logic. Additionally, we have 528 units in-transit, but only 109 units (from P13, P14) are actually viable and timely. The OR backend calculates order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To ensure we actually receive enough inventory, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target stock level to offset this phantom inventory. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approx. 3 periods of demand [325] + 219 lost units + safety buffer) will force the system to ignore the pipeline drag and maintain stock. Since stock-outs are frequent (on-hand is 0), and L varies between 1 and 2, I will set L to 2 and sigma_hat to an explicit value of 80 to account for high demand volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the 'Maja Cardigan' is in a high-demand phase, likely driven by late spring seasonality and its recycled material appeal. The most recent demand (P15) spiked to 162 units, with an average over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) of ~119 units/week. However, a significant operational problem persists: out of the 782 units 'In-transit', 219 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (9, 120, and 90 units respectively) are confirmed lost, as they are now 12+ periods overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (782 units) from its target stock, it will vastly under-order unless the target stock is inflated to compensate for these 219 'phantom' units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the recent average (~120 * 3 = 360) PLUS the 219 lost units, totaling 579. This ensures the backend recognizes the need for new physical stock. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility observed in May (162 vs 66).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late May (P15: 162 units), raising the 5-period average to 119 units/week. Lost shipment count remains constant at 219 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The product is a seasonal knitwear item (cardigan). Demand has stabilized at a high level, with the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging 124 units/week. Lead times are volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. A critical issue remains: 219 units from orders P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost but are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. With current In-transit at 782, the backend believes the pipeline is full, but 219 of those units will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders to meet demand, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 219 phantom units. Average demand (124) * (1 + Promised L=2) = 372. Adding the 219 lost units to this target gives 591. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 591 to force the ordering mechanism to ignore the lost stock. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent high volatility (std dev ~38 over the last 5 periods, scaled by sqrt(1+L)).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (June 10), we are managing a seasonal knitwear item (Maja Cardigan). Demand remains robust, averaging 138 units over the last 4 periods (P14-P17) and 132 units over the last 8 periods (P10-P17). Currently, there is an inventory imbalance due to 219 units from early orders (P1, P3, P4) being confirmed lost. The OR engine counts these lost units as 'in-transit' (pipeline inventory), which leads it to under-order. To fix this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to the (L+1) period demand forecast PLUS the lost units. With an estimated lead time L=2, the coverage needed is 3 periods of demand (approx. 405 units) + 219 lost units = 624. Setting mu_hat to 624 forces the engine to place an order that accounts for the phantom stock. Sigma_hat is set to 125 based on recent demand volatility (std approx 40, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). The product is a soft knit cardigan, and demand has transitioned from the spring peak into a sustained summer level. Over the last 4 periods (P15-P18), demand averaged 137.75 units/week, though it has cooled slightly from the mid-May peak of 162. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat (approx 138 units/week) to capture this latest stabilization. As documented since Period 10, there are 219 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (vold orders P1, P3, and P4) that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. This causes systemic under-ordering. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on demand for (L+1) periods (3 weeks * 138 = 414), add the 219 lost units as a 'virtual buffer' to neutralize the phantom inventory, and then add a safety buffer (z*sigma). With a service level q = 0.95 (19/(19+1)), z \u2248 1.645. Weekly sigma over the last 6 periods is ~18, so safety stock for 3 periods (~sqrt(3)*18) is roughly 31. Total mu_hat target = 414 + 219 + 31 = 664. Lead time calculation is set to 'recent_N=5' to reflect recent arrivals (L=2) while allowing the backend to adjust if variability returns.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for this cardigan (knitwear) remains high into the summer, likely due to its lightweight/recycled polyester nature. Demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) has averaged approximately 133 units/week (162, 142, 130, 117, 116). The lead time remains volatile but generally clusters around 1-2 periods; specifically, P18 arrived in 1 period. A major constraint remains the 219 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are permanently lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (572 units) from its base stock calculation, and 219 of those units will never arrive, the system will chronically under-order by 219 units. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target stock level. I will set the per-period demand forecast to 130 units. Total mu_hat = (1+L) * 130 + 219 (offset). With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 130) + 219 = 609. Sigma_hat is set to 52 (approx sqrt(3) * 30) to account for high volatility seen in P15-P16.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime through June (P15-P19) stabilized at a higher average of ~133 units/week, compared to the ~110 units/week observed in early May.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand for this SKU (Maja Cardigan) has stabilized at a higher regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is approximately 122 units/week (142, 130, 117, 116, 105). Although recent demand shows a slight downward trend from the late May peak, it remains significantly higher than early season levels. A critical issue remains: 219 units from early orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/missing. These units reside in the 'In-transit' count (pipeline inventory) in the OR backend's view, preventing it from ordering sufficient stock to meet real demand. To counteract this, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values that are inflated by the lost quantity. My target base stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand + the 219 lost units. With L=2 (promised), I need to cover 3 weeks of demand (~366 units) plus 219 (total ~585). Setting mu_hat to 585 ensures the backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order despite the phantom inventory. I use the 'recent_N' method for lead time to reflect recent 1-2 period delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for mid-June through early July (P17-P20) stabilized at approximately 117 units/week, slightly lower than the May peak but consistent.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 22 (July 8, 2019). The product is a cardigan (knitwear), which typically sees demand shifts during seasonal transitions. Analysis of the last 5 periods (P17-P21) shows a stable demand average of approximately 114 units/week (130, 117, 116, 105, 103). The 'In-transit' quantity of 668 units includes 219 units from historical orders (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost (at least 15+ periods overdue). These lost 'phantom' units are visible to the OR backend as current pipeline inventory, causing it to under-order. To correct for this, I must inflate the target stock (mu_hat) by the amount of lost inventory. The desired base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window at current demand (~114) would be ~342 units. Adding the 219 lost units gives a target of ~561 units. I will use 'explicit' values to provide this adjustment directly, bypassing the backend's automated calculation which cannot 'see' that 219 units of the pipeline will never arrive. Lead time is set to 2 (promised), as arrivals have been generally predictable lately (L=1 or L=2).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. Demand remains stable in the mid-summer period, with the last 5 periods (P18-P22) averaging 113.6 units/week. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods; the most recent arrival (P20 order) arrived in 2 periods. There is a critical inventory issue: On-hand is 0, and the 'In-transit' of 614 units is heavily inflated by $219$ units confirmed lost from the early periods (P1, P3, P4). The OR backend calculates orders as `base_stock - pipeline_inventory`. If the pipeline is mathematically 'full' of lost units that will never arrive, the backend will stop ordering. To fix this, I must set `mu_hat` explicitly to a value that covers the desired 3-week base stock (L+1 periods) PLUS the 219 dead units. Target weekly demand = 115. Desired Base Stock for L=2 (3 periods) = $115 	imes 3 = 345$. Adjusting for phantom inventory: $345 + 219 = 564$. This ensures the backend places an order despite the phantom 219 units. Sigma is set to reflect current volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '679854001' (soft knit cardigan) is entering late July. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime range (approx. 110-120 units/week) since May, with the last 4 periods (P20-P23) averaging 109.75 units. Despite being mid-summer, demand remains surprisingly robust for a knitwear item, likely due to consistent collection popularity. A major accounting issue persists: 219 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/missing but remain in the 'in-transit' count (572 units total). This phantom inventory tricks the OR engine into under-ordering because it believes it has 219 more units than it actually does. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I will forecast a weekly average demand of 115 units. Over a 3-period horizon (L+1), this totals 345 units. I will then add the 219 lost units to this target, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 564. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to ignore the lost pipeline units and place necessary orders to meet current demand. L is set to calculated as recent arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29 (Period 25). Demand for the 'Maja Cardigan' has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) at an average of ~106 units/week, showing a slight decrease compared to the early summer peak. The system currently shows 'In-transit: 594 units'; however, historical 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 219 units from P1, P3, and P4 are permanently lost. Subtracting these 'phantom' units leaves an effective pipeline of 375 units. These 375 units likely correspond to orders from P13, P14, and recent periods. Despite 375 units in transit, the current on-hand inventory is 0. With a profit margin of $19 vs $1 holding cost, the critical fractile is 0.95, necessitating high service levels. Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline of 594 from its target stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target to bypass this logic and trigger an order to cover the current stockout. I will set mu_hat based on the stable demand of ~106 units/week multiplied by (1+L), and then add the 219 lost units to the base stock calculation.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 5th, 2019. Demand for the Maja Cardigan has entered a slight downward trend as late summer approaches, with the last 4 periods (P22-P25) averaging ~101 units/week, compared to the ~117 units observed in July. On-hand inventory is 0. Total potential in-transit inventory is listed as 594. However, historical logs reveal that 219 units from early orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, as they are over 20 periods overdue. This creates 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend's calculation. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target stock calculation: We need (L+1) weeks of coverage. With an average demand of ~100 units/week and L=2, base stock should be ~300. Adding the 219 lost units to bypass the backend pipeline subtraction results in a target mu_hat of 519. I will use 515 as a conservative estimate. Lead time remains consistently 1-2 periods, so the default/calculate method for L is appropriate. Sigma is set to recent observations to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand downward trend observed in late July/early August, averaging ~101 units/week (P22-P25) vs ~117 units in mid-July.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 12, 2019. We are observing a sustained downward demand trend for the knitwear cardigan as we move deeper into August, with the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaging approximately 98.6 units/week compared to the ~117 units seen in mid-July. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 594 units in-transit. Crucially, 219 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost shipments that have never arrived. Additionally, recent orders from P24 and P25 (totalling 22 units) have not arrived within the promised 2-period lead time yet, though it is too early to declare them lost. To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory (219 lost units) that the OR engine incorrectly thinks will arrive, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I will use a conservative forecast for the next 3 periods (L+1) based on the recent average of ~100 units/week, then add 219 units to offset the lost pipeline: (3 * 100) + 219 = 519. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover actual expected demand. Sigma remains based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued further downward in August: the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaged ~99 units/week, confirming a seasonal decline from the ~133 units/week peak in June.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. The product is a knitwear cardigan, and historical data shows a demand plateau around 100 units/week during August (P22-P27 avg \u2248 99). There is an massive on-hand inventory deficit (0 on-hand). The 'In-transit' indicator shows 594 units, but carry-over insights and history confirm that P1 (9 units), P3 (120 units), and P4 (90 units) are permanently lost (total 219 phantom units). Additionally, no orders were placed in P25-P27, and P24 (22 units) is still in transit. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 3 periods (L=2 + review=1) at 100 units/period, totaling 300. To bypass the 219 units of phantom inventory in the backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate the mu_hat by approximately 219 units. Target mu_hat = 300 (actual needed) + 219 (offset) = 519. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26 (Period 29). The product is a cardigan, which typically experiences a sales dip in late summer before a potential autumn recovery. Historical demand from Period 22 to 28 indicates a stabilized but lower demand regime averaging 99.3 units/week (standard deviation ~14). The OR backend calculation for the base stock level subtracts pipeline inventory. Currently, the 'In-transit' shows 594 units. However, 219 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost (as noted in prior insights), creating 'phantom inventory' that prevents the OR engine from ordering enough. To compensate, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand across (L+1) periods plus the 219 lost units. Expected demand for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 300 units. Adding the 219 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 519. I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 25 (representing a slightly higher volatility than the recent 14) to maintain service levels during this shift.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the product (knit cardigan) is entering the core autumn season. History shows a major demand surge in early Spring (Feb/Mar) and stability through the summer. Current demand (P24-P29) has averaged 94.8 units/week, displaying resilience despite being slightly lower than the June peak. However, there is a severe inventory crisis: on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has not received an order arrival for 6 consecutive periods (since P23). The 'In-transit' quantity of 594 includes the 219 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4) plus orders from P24 onwards that are now significantly overdue (P24: 6 periods ago, P25-P29: no orders placed). To force the OR backend to place a substantial catch-up order despite the large (partially phantom) pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 600. This represents roughly 6 weeks of demand (L+1 + recovery buffer) and is designed to exceed the 594 units currently in the pipeline, triggering an order. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value of 60 to protect against further lead-time volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to align with the promised value and recent historical successes (P12-P21).

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption: No arrivals observed from P24 to P29 (6 periods), suggesting a new batch of orders (including P24's 22 units) may be delayed or lost alongside the original 219 lost units. Autumn demand is currently steady at ~95 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the stock status is critical (0 on-hand) due to a persistent supply chain disruption where no orders have arrived for 6 consecutive periods (P24-P30). The total pipeline inventory is abnormally high at 699 units, but historical evidence from Periods 1-10 confirms that at least 219 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are physically lost. Furthermore, orders P24 (22 units) and early P30 (105 units) haven't arrived yet. To ensure the OR backend places a new order despite the phantom pipeline, I must use 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the target base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 plus current period). Demand is steady for autumn at ~95-100 units/week. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mu + lost_units. With avg demand ~100 and lost units ~219, the target should be (3 * 100) + 219 = 519. To communicate this to the OR engine (which uses mu_hat as the (L+1) demand component), I set mu_hat to 519. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (before the gap) were consistent with promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: No arrivals for 7 periods (P24-P30). Total lost/extremely delayed inventory estimated at 241+ units (219 from spring + 22 from P24). Demand is currently stable in an autumn regime averaging 101 units/week (P26-P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32 (mid-September). Demand is stable in an autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging 106.4 units/week. Significant supply chain issues persist: there haven't been any arrivals since Period 23, meaning orders from P24 (22 units) and P30 (105 units) are currently undelivered. Additionally, the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 219 units from the spring (P1, P3, P4) remains lost. The total 'In-transit' figure of 699 likely includes these 219 lost units and other non-concluded orders. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this high (but mostly unusable) pipeline, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) based on the current mean (approx 106), then add the 219 lost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering. target = 320 (3 weeks) + 219 (offset) = 539. I keep L at the default to maintain the 2-period horizon logic.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 679854001 (Maja Cardigan) is currently in its autumn demand phase, which has shown remarkable stability over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), averaging 103 units/week with low volatility. After a severe supply chain disruption where no orders arrived for 7 consecutive periods (P24-P30), an arrival finally occurred in Period 32 (105 units from P30), confirming that the supply chain is re-activating, although recent orders (like P30) are being prioritized over much older missing stock. The total amount of 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains a critical concern: approximately 241 units (219 from spring + 22 from P24) are effectively lost but still reside in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count. To ensure the backend places an order to meet the current 103 units/week demand despite this 241-unit phantom inventory, I will explicitly set mu_hat. The target base stock needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. With L=2, (L+1)=3 periods. Total Safety Stock + Cycle Stock needed \u2248 3 * 103 + 241 = 550. This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation (where pipeline is ~594) accounts for the fact that nearly half that pipeline doesn't exist. Setting mu_hat to 550 will force the replenishment signal.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed in Period 32 with the arrival of the Period 30 order (L=2), however, the 241 units from P1, P3, P4, and P24 remain confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Autumn demand (Sept) is stable at 103 units/week.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand remained strong at 136 units, significantly above the September average of approximately 103. The current date is September 30, heading into October, which is a peak season for knitwear (cardigans). I must maintain a high stock level to avoid stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 594 units includes 241 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P24), creating a 'phantom inventory' problem. To bypass the OR engine's capped policy and pipeline logic that subtracts in-transit units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to a high value that covers the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (3 periods total), while also offsetting the 241 units that will never arrive but are still 'in-transit'. Based on recent demand (avg ~114 over last 5 periods) and October seasonality, I estimate demand at 115/week. Required base stock = (3 * 115) + Safeguard + 241 lost units \u2248 700. I set mu_hat explicitly to 700 to ensure the backend generates an order that actually puts physical stock on the shelf, despite the 219+22 phantom units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (Oct 7), we are in an Autumn demand regime for this long-sleeved knit cardigan. Demand has been stable over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) with an average of 116.2 units/week (119, 106, 101, 136, 119), showing a slight uptick from the late-summer trough. The supply chain has partially stabilized after a severe disruption: the Period 30 order arrived on time (L=2 in Period 32), confirming that new orders are moving, though a massive 241 units (P1, P3, P4, P24) remain lost. This creates 'phantom inventory' in the OR backend's logic (Base Stock - Pipeline), leading to systemic under-ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~116 * 3 = 348) PLUS the 241 units of phantom inventory, totaling 589. This ensures the backend places orders despite the inflated pipeline count. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 periods to capture the current volatility (std dev \u2248 13.5, scaled by sqrt(3) \u2248 23.4).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (Sept-Oct) confirmed stable at ~116 units/week. Supply chain resumed with L=2 for new orders, but 241 units of pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4, P24) are permanently lost and must be offset by parameter inflation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the demand for the Maja Cardigan remains in a stable autumn regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 109.2 units/week. While the promised lead time is 2, the supply chain has been unreliable. Most critically, 241 units of pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4, P24) are confirmed lost and remain in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I am applying an explicit inflation to mu_hat. Base mu_hat for (1+L=3) periods would be ~328 units. To bypass the 241 phantom units and ensure the OR engine actually places an order to cover current demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 569 (328 + 241). This forces the engine to target a base stock that accounts for the fact that those 241 units will never arrive. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent standard deviation over the last 5 periods (approx 19.5 units) transformed by sqrt(1+L), resulting in roughly 34.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the autumn season for knitwear. Recent demand has shown a slight downward trend from the September peak (~116 units) to an average of ~81.5 units over the last two periods (P35-P36). However, looking at the last 5 periods (P32-P36), the average is 103.8. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this stabilization. Crucially, the supply chain has significant 'phantom' inventory: P1 (9), P3 (120), P4 (90), and P24 (22) totaling 241 units are confirmed lost or extremely overdue, yet they remain in the 'In-transit' calculation (739 units total). To force the OR engine to order despite this 241-unit inflated pipeline, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 241 units above the expected (1+L) period demand. Expected demand for (1+2=3) periods is ~312 units (104 * 3). Adding the 241-unit offset yields a mu_hat of ~553. Lead time remains at the default of 2 periods based on the most recent successful delivery (P30 arrived P32).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand plateaued in October: the average for P35-P36 is ~82 units, down from the September average of ~114 units. Total confirmed lost/phantom pipeline inventory remains 241 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the demand for the 'Maja Cardigan' is in a seasonal decline. The last three periods (P35-P37) show demand of 84, 79, and 74 units, averaging 79 units/week, which is a clear drop from the September average of ~114 units. A significant operational hurdle persists: the OR backend thinks we have 739 units in-transit, but 241 of those (from P1, P3, P4, and P24) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. To force the OR engine to order despite this 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand PLUS the 241 lost units. Projected demand is ~80 units/week. Target stock = (3 weeks * 80) + 241 = 481. By setting mu_hat slightly above this (to 500) and using a high explicit sigma_hat, I ensure the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the 739 units it believes are coming.

Carry-over insight: Late Oct seasonal decline confirmed: P35-P37 avg demand is 79 units/week (-30% vs Sept). Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at 241 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), we are in a late autumn seasonal decline. Demand over the last 4 periods (P35-P38) has averaged approximately 72 units/week, down from the September/October average of 116. The Maja Cardigan is a knitwear item, and demand typically softens as we move deeper into November before potentially rallying for the holiday season. A primary constraint is the OR engine's 'inventory view': it sees 739 units in-transit, but 241 of those are permanently lost (P1: 9, P3: 120, P4: 90, P24: 22). This 'phantom inventory' causes the backend to under-order or stop ordering entirely. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, inflating the target to cover the 241 lost units plus the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon. With L=2 and a current demand mean of 72, the base requirement is 3 * 72 = 216 units. Adding the 241 unit 'phantom buffer' results in a target mu_hat of 457. This forces the backend to recognize that the actual available pipeline is insufficient.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn seasonal decline confirmed: Nov demand is averaging ~72 units/week (-38% vs Sept).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. The demand for cardigans is in a clear seasonal decline as we enter late autumn; the last 5 periods (P35-P39) averaged ~66 units/week, with the most recent sample at 41. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this deceleration. Lead time has been stable at 2 periods recently. A critical issue is the 241 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P24). The OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic will cause it to under-order or not order at all if it believes these 241 units are coming. To force the engine to order despite this phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Forecasted mean for (L+1) periods = 3 * 66 = 198. To offset the 241 phantom units, I adjust mu_hat to 198 + 241 = 439. This ensures the engine places an order to meet actual impending demand.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn seasonal decline deepened: Period 35-39 average demand is 66 units/week (-42% vs September average). Phantom pipeline inventory fixed at 241 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The SKU is a 'Maja Cardigan', which aligns with seasonal knitwear demand. Historical data shows a clear seasonal decline starting in October, with demand dropping from ~116 units/week in Sept to ~72 in early Nov, and most recently hitting 20 units in Period 40. The 5-period average (P36-P40) is 53.2 units/week, reflecting this late autumn/winter downtrend. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 739 units; however, 241 units (P1, P3, P4, P24) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. Additionally, the Period 34 order (145 units) is now 6 periods overdue (expected P36) and appears lost. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the 53.2 avg) but inflate it explicitly to bypass the OR engine's capped policy and account for the ~386 units of phantom pipeline inventory (241 + 145) that are preventing necessary reordering. Setting mu_hat to a value that covers the expected 53 units/week demand plus the phantom gap.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total increased to 386 units: P34 order (145 units) is 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, joining the existing 241 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P24). Demand continues late-autumn decline, averaging 53.2 units/week over the last 5 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), the product (Maja Cardigan) is in a deep seasonal demand decline as autumn ends. The last 3 periods (P39-P41) show very low demand (41, 20, 22), averaging ~28 units/week. This follows a clear downward trend from the September peak (~116). Additionally, there is a massive supply chain issue: 'In-transit' shows 739 units, but 386 units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34). These are lost shipments that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available pipeline, leading it to under-order or not order at all. To protect against this, I must inflate the target stock (mu_hat) significantly to bypass the phantom inventory block. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand plus the current phantom total (386 units), using a 3-week look-ahead (L+1). Even with the decline, we must ensure the backend places an order if the real on-hand is zero.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total remains at 386 units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34). Demand is in a late-November trough, averaging ~28 units/week over the last 3 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the product is in a deep late-autumn/early-winter decline. Demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) has averaged 43.8 units/week, though Period 42 saw a temporary spike to 84. The broader trend since September (avg ~110) suggests a clear downward seasonal regime. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory: 386 units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34) are confirmed lost or extremely overdue, yet the OR backend counts them toward the base stock target. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and total in-transit is 739, the backend sees plenty of supply. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to explicitly exceed this phantom pipeline plus the expected demand for the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to 386 (lost) + 150 (3 weeks of demand at ~50/week) = 536. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 386 units of dead pipeline stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-12-09, heading into the final periods of the year. Demand for this cardigan (679854001) has significantly declined as part of a late-autumn/winter seasonal trend, with the last 5 periods (P39-P43) averaging 40 units/week. However, the system faces a severe logic challenge: there are 386 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34) that the backend believes will arrive but are empirically lost or stuck. With On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 739 (where ~386 are lost), the effective inventory is only ~353. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 739 from its targets, it won't order more until the on-hand stock is dangerously depleted or the in-transit value drops. To force an order and maintain service levels for the remaining periods, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 600. This value is calculated to exceed the phantom inventory (386) plus desired buffer for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods * 40 units/period = 120), totaling ~506, which I've rounded up to 600 to ensure the backend places an order. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent high volatility (e.g., P42 demand spike to 84).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for this cardigan has significantly declined following the autumn peak, currently averaging ~43 units/week over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). Inventory management is severely complicated by 386 units of phantom in-transit inventory (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34), which are confirmed lost but still seen by the OR backend. With only 3 periods remaining (45, 46, 47) and a promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now would arrive in Period 47, which is the final period. Given that lost units (386) vastly exceed the expected demand for the remaining periods, the OR engine will not place any orders naturally. However, since on-hand is 0, we must provide parameters that reflect the current demand floor while acknowledging that any late orders carry high holding cost risk and minimal utility. We set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (~43 units/week * 3 = 129) and maintain sigma_hat based on recent volatility. No target stock inflation is needed this close to the end because the primary goal is clearing existing stock (if any arrives) rather than accumulating more.

Carry-over insight: Late autumn/early winter demand floor confirmed: P40-P44 demand averaged 43 units/week, a 62% decline from the September average (~114).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (late December). The product is a soft cardigan, which historically saw a significant demand surge in February/March (knitwear season). Current demand is in a deep trough, averaging ~40 units/week over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), consistent with the end of the autumn/winter cycle. A major inventory management challenge persists: out of the 739 units currently 'In-transit', 386 units (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34) are confirmed lost/extremely overdue and will likely never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level by precisely the amount of lost inventory. For Period 46, my forecast for the review + lead period (3 periods) is 40 * 3 = 120 units. Adding the 386 units of phantom inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 506. Lead time (L) remains 2 periods, and sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 25) scaled over 3 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand for this knitwear cardigan has stabilized at a low winter floor, with the last 5 periods (P42-P46) averaging approximately 42 units/week (though P42 saw a one-week spike to 84). The total in-transit pipeline of 739 units is heavily compromised by 'phantom' inventory: 386 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P24, P34), and the remaining units from more recent periods are likewise not arriving, suggesting a systemic supply chain failure. Since the backend OR logic subtracts the entire in-transit pipeline (739) from the target base stock, it will never place a new order even though on-hand is zero. To force an order and bypass this phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to explicitly cover the current demand (L+1) plus the lost units (386). Current demand mean (based on P42-P46) is ~42. Calculation for explicit mu_hat: (1+L)*42 + 386 = 3*42 + 386 = 126 + 386 = 512. L is kept at 2 as the baseline, though actual reliability is low. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent localized volatility including the P42 spike.
