Historical demand from early Jan to early Feb showed a range of 1 to 7 units, with an average of approximately 4.8 units per week. February is still cold in many regions, maintaining demand for cardigans. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts during the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Assuming a conservative forecast of ~6 units per period plus a small safety stock for the lead time uncertainty, the target pipeline is ~18-20 units.

As a transitional knitwear item, demand is expected to be relatively high in late February/early March as consumers move between winter and spring. Demand Regime: Historical data from Jan/Feb 2019 (pre-game) showed low demand (1-7 units). However, the last two weeks (Period 1 and 2) show a massive spike to 18 and 79 respectively. This suggests a seasonal surge or a promotional event for the Divided collection. Pipeline & Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (20 units) are scheduled to arrive in P3 resolution (after the current decision). Orders placed in P2 (35 units) are scheduled for P4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and have lost 97 units of potential sales (18 in P1 + 79 in P2) due to zero inventory. Inventory Strategy: We need to cover demand for P3 (current), P4, and P5 (since an order placed now arrives in P5). Expected demand is trending upwards significantly. Given the jump from 18 to 79, P3 demand could easily exceed 80-100 units. Pipeline is currently 55 units (20 + 35). To cover a conservative estimate of 80 units/period for the next 3 periods (240 total), minus 55 in-transit, I need to order approximately 185 units to catch up and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high demand volatility in this collection.",

Mean demand appears to be around 50-60 units/week. (c) Lead time: Promised 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (20 units), P2 (35 units), P3 (185 units). P1 order (ordered P1) should arrive DURING P3 resolution and be visible in P3 conclude. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests actual lead time > 2 or a delay.

(e) Logic: We need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Forecasting ~60 units/period, target pipeline = 180 units. Currently in-transit = 240. Since we have 240 coming and on-hand is 0, we are already slightly over-committed if demand stays at 60.

In-transit inventory is 375 (from the 150 ordered in P10 and 225 remaining from earlier logic/adjustments, though historical 'conclude' messages show P1, P3, and P4 were lost). Looking at the pipeline: P10 order (150) is due now (P13/P14). Total inventory position (On-hand 186 + In-transit 375 = 561) is extremely high relative to the average demand of ~110.

Historical demand for the start of the year (late winter/early spring) showed a significant upward trend as the product likely aligns with spring layering. Currently, we are entering the pre-autumn phase where demand for light knitwear typically increases. Recent demand has been steady around 80-100 units, but with a potential for seasonal growth as we approach late August. Supply chain analysis: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory (lost shipments) stands at 675 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). Current reported In-transit is 975. Effective In-transit = 975 - 675 = 300 units. These 300 units correspond to orders from P23 (150) and P25 (150). The P23 order is now at L=2 and should arrive in Period 26. On-hand is 46. Expected inventory for Period 26 resolution: 46 (OH) + 150 (P23 arrival) = 196 units. Forecasted demand is ~100. This leaves ~96 units for Period 27. To cover Period 27 demand (~100) and Period 28 (~110), and accounting for lead time (L=2), I need a total pipeline of ~310 units. Current effective pipeline (P25 order) is 150.

Supply chain reliability remains a major factor: based on Period 26 conclude, the Period 23 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that L can drift beyond the promised 2. Cumulative 'ghost inventory' (lost orders) remains at 675 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). The current reported 'In-transit' is 975 units. Subtracting 675 ghosts leaves an effective pipeline of 300 units (representing orders from P25 and P26).

Estimating demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at a slightly elevated average of 110 units/week to account for early fall seasonality, I need a coverage of ~330 units. While the current 407 units coverage appears sufficient, the high risk of shipment loss and entering the peak fall season justifies maintaining a continuous order flow.

However, recent demand shows a clear downward trend: 136 (P33) -> 119 -> 84 -> 79 -> 74 -> 52 (P38). This suggests the peak Autumn demand has passed, and we are entering a slower late-autumn regime. Current On-hand inventory is 180 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1125 units includes 825 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and now P34, which is overdue at L=5). Subtracting 825 from 1125 leaves an effective pipeline of 300 units (Orders from P35 and P36). With 180 on hand and 300 coming, total availability is 480 units. Given the current demand average of ~65 units over the last two periods and a declining trend, 480 units covers more than 7 periods of demand. No new order is required this period to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the year.",

We are currently in mid-November (Period 40), and historical data shows a clear downward demand trend over the last 6 weeks: dropping from 119 in late September to 41 in early November. This suggests the autumn peak has passed and we are entering a lower winter baseline or end-of-season decline. Inventory Assessment: On-hand inventory is 289 units. Reported in-transit is 975 units, but as documented in 'carry_over_insights', 825 units are confirmed lost/ghost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P34). Therefore, the effective in-transit is 150 units (corresponding to a later order). Total effective inventory (On-hand 289 + Pipeline 150) = 439 units. Given the current demand (41 units and falling), 439 units provide over 10 periods of coverage. There is no risk of stockout before the end of the year (Period 47), but there is a significant risk of excessive holding costs if we order more. No order is necessary.",

Demand has dropped significantly from the autumn peak, bottoming out at around 20 units in mid-November before a recent late-November uptick to 84 (likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales). Since we are in the 'Period 43 decision phase', we only have 4 more periods of demand to satisfy (44, 45, 46, and 47). Current on-hand inventory is 163 units. Total In-transit is 975, but we must account for 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Confirmed lost orders are P1 (20), P3 (185), P4 (20), P10 (150), P17 (150), P19 (150), and P34 (150), totaling 825 units. The true effective In-transit is 975 - 825 = 150 units (likely the P41 or P42 orders, though the history shows no orders placed since P36 except for theoretical arrivals). Comparing our on-hand inventory (163) against late-season demand (averaging ~40-50 units outside of sale spikes), we have enough inventory to last approximately 3-4 periods. Ordering more now (at L=2) would result in arrivals in Period 45 or 46, which risks high holding costs at the end of the game given the low winter demand regime. Therefore, I will rely on existing stock to maximize profit and minimize final holding costs.",

Demand has significantly cooled from the autumn peaks (136 units) to a low winter level, averaging 40 units over the last 4 periods (20, 22, 84, 33). The high demand of 84 in P42 appears to be a Black Friday/Cyber Monday outlier rather than a sustained shift. On-hand inventory is 130 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 975 units is heavily inflated by 825 units of confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P34). This leaves an effective pipeline of 150 units (likely the P36 order, though that already arrived in P39, meaning In-transit likely contains newer undelivered orders or the system hasn't cleared the others).

Given the mid-December date, we expect a potential modest increase due to holiday shopping before a likely January lull. The inventory situation shows 95 units on hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 975 units is significantly inflated by historical 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). As of Period 39, confirmed lost units totaled 825. This leaves a reported 150 units as potentially valid pipeline. However, looking at the history, no orders have been placed since Period 36. Since P36 arrived at P39, there is actually NO valid inventory in transit. The 975 units in transit are all historical lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P34, and likely P25/26/28/30/31/32/33/35/36 balances or similar accounting discrepancies).
