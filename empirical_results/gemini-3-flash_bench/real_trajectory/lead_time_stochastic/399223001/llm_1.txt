Looking at the five historical data points provided (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04), demand has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend, averaging approximately 261 units per week (min 233, max 298). The date is Feb 11, 2019. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 3 (visible at the start of P4). Therefore, I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 with this order and future orders. Since I start with 0 stock, I am guaranteed to lose sales in P1 and P2 (as the earliest arrival is P3). To build inventory for P3 demand and beyond, I will target the historical average plus a small buffer. Estimated mean demand is ~260. To cover P3 and provide a safety stock for P4, I will order 550 units.",

(c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The P1 order of 550 will arrive at the start of P3 (visible at start of P4). (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Currently on-hand is 0. Demand for P1 was 298 but went unsatisfied because arrivals happen after the decision phase and lead time >= 1. We are in a stockout. We have 550 in transit (from P1). We need to cover demand for P2, P3, and P4 (Lead time L=2 + Current Period). Total coverage needed = ~270 * 3 = 810 units. (e) Order Logic: Pipeline contains 550. Target inventory (810) - Pipeline (550) = 260.

Given the date (March 4th), we are moving into the spring season where denim typically remains a strong seller. b) Demand Regime: Historical data (late Jan/early Feb) showed demand around 230-290. Period 1-3 observed demand was 298, 272, and 199. The average is approximately 256. The drop to 199 in Period 3 might be a weekly fluctuation or early March seasonality, but I will forecast around 250 for safety. c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. My Period 1 order (550 units) should arrive during Period 3 (concluded) or Period 4 (current). Since it did not show as 'arrived' in the Period 1 or 2 conclude messages, I expect it to arrive during this Period 4.

Estimated demand for 3 periods = 250 * 3 = 750. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 860. This already covers the expected demand for the next three periods.

Lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 160 units, and there are 700 units in-transit (reflecting potential older orders or system-tracked lost shipments, however, recent periods P11-P13 had zero orders, meaning this 'in-transit' likely refers to older unarrived orders like P1, P3, P4 which were previously flagged as likely lost). Looking at the pipeline: demand is stable around 160. On-hand covers roughly 1 period (P14). An order placed now (P14) will arrive in P15 or P16. Considering the holding cost equals profit ($1.0), I must avoid overstocking while ensuring supply. Given the large 'in-transit' figure of 700 units (which exceeds demand for 4 periods) relative to the fact that I haven't ordered since P10, I must assume these are either lost or will create a massive overstock if they arrive. However, I need to maintain service level. I will order 250 units to secure coverage for P16-P17, assuming a conservative demand of ~160/period, keeping in mind that existing on-hand (160) will likely be depleted by P14 demand.",

Period 26 arrival (150 units from P23) took 3 periods, confirming that lead times are stretching or unreliable. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0. The total In-transit is 1750, but per historical insights, a significant portion (approx 1100-1150 units) is likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P24 (200), P25 (150), and P26 (250), totaling 600 units. Expected demand for the next 3 weeks (covering lead time + decision period) is projected at ~180-200 units/week due to the seasonal uptick. Total demand coverage needed: 3 periods * 200 = 600 units. Since current on-hand is 0 and the reliable pipeline is 600, I have just enough to cover immediate demand if they arrive.

Inventory levels are critical: on-hand inventory is only 41 units. Pipeline analysis: Total in-transit is 2200 units, but historical records show roughly 1550 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P24, P26) are confirmed or likely lost due to exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods.

I expect demand to remain at least at the current Fall baseline (~320-350) or increase towards 400+ in the coming weeks. Inventory on-hand is 511. The pipeline is complex: In-transit is 3450 units, but historical data shows a ~75% loss rate. Recent successful deliveries (P35, P37) show lead times of 1 period, while others (P32, P33) took 3 periods. Order P34 (700 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost. Order P36 (500 units) is 3 periods old and might still arrive. Order P38 (400 units) was just placed. To ensure coverage for a 3-period window (P39, P40, P41) at an estimated 350 units/week (Total 1050), I need to account for the unreliability of the pipeline. Current reliable stock is 511. I will order 400 units to maintain a buffer for the expected late-November peak, considering that many units in the 3450 'in-transit' figure are likely phantom inventory from lost shipments.",
