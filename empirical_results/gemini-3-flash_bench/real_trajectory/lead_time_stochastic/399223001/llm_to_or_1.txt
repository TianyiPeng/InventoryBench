Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Feb 11, 2019. We are looking at SKU 399223001 (Curvy Jeggings), a staples item in ladies' denim. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks ranges from 233 to 298, with an average of 260.6 and a standard deviation of 29.5. There are no current seasonal drivers indicated for Mid-February for this specific product category, but Valentine's Day falls in the current week (Feb 14), which may slightly influence retail visits. Given we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 2). For \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) and \u03c3\u0302 (sigma_hat), I will use the full history available (N=5) to stabilize the initial order. Since the lead time is L=2, the OR engine will target covering (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). In Period 1, we ordered 308 units based on the initial demand observation of 298. Note that zero units were sold in Period 1 because the starting inventory was 0 and the order placed in P1 has not arrived yet (Promised Lead Time = 2). The order for 308 units is correctly showing as 'In-transit'. Historical demand data (samples from Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values: 258, 233, 280, 234, 298. The mean of these 5 samples is 260.6, and the standard deviation is 28.1. Period 1 demand was 298, which is on the higher end but consistent with the upward trend seen in the last sample. Since there is no seasonal event (mid-February) suggesting a massive spike for Curvy Jeggings beyond regular variance, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current mean and volatility. I will keep L at default (2 periods) as there is no evidence yet from 'conclude' messages to suggest a shift in lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our product is 'Curvy Jeggings', a denim item. Historical demand from the prompt (last 5 weeks: 258, 233, 280, 234, 298) and game history (P1: 298, P2: 272) shows a stable demand mean of approximately 268. Promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered in P1 (308 units) and P2 (323 units). As per the define lead time rules, an order with L=2 placed in P1 arrives during P3 and is visible in the P3 conclude (read at P4). Thus, seeing arrived=0 in P1 and P2 conclude is expected. Currently, on-hand is 0, lead time is 2, and we have 631 units in transit (308 + 323). I will use the default lead time (2) and recent_N for demand to capture the most recent patterns (N=7 to include the 5 historical plus 2 game periods).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have lost all demand for the first three periods because no shipments have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) should have arrived during Period 3 (Feb 25) and been visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Since 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 3, the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is lost/delayed. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of ~260. Recent demand (last 3 weeks) is 298, 272, and 199 (mean ~256). Since the product (Curvy Jeggings) is a staple item and we are entering March, demand should remain relatively stable. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the observed delay and using recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the most recent trend while ignoring the volatility caused by the stockout-distorted demand signal. The goal is to build up inventory once shipments finally land.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; P1 order (Feb 11) did not arrive by end of P3 (Feb 25), suggesting L >= 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5, we have observed the first arrival confirming a lead time. The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), while the order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) has not arrived. Since the Feb 11 order is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in P3), it is likely lost. Current on-hand is 146, and pipeline inventory is 718 (P1: 308 [assumed lost], P3: 172, P4: 238). Demand has significantly dropped from the initial ~280 range to ~185 over the last three weeks (P3: 199, P4: 177, historical mean was ~260). I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for demand to capture the drop. Because the P1 order is likely lost but still counted in the OR's 'in-transit' logic, I will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order to compensate for the lost stock and the demand slowdown. Calculated mu_hat for L=2: (1+2)*185 = 555.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (308 units) confirmed likely lost; P2 order arrived on time (L=2) while P1 remains undelivered at P5 start. Demand regime shift detected at Period 3: average decreased from ~260 to ~188 (-28%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $146.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 with demand consistently exceeding supply, leading to stockouts. Historically, demand shifted at P3 from ~260 to ~188. However, P5 saw a stockout where 146 units were sold but 188 units were demanded, confirming the lower regime. Lead time analysis: P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). The P1 order (placed Feb 11) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, confirming it is lost. The P3 order (172 units) was placed on Feb 25; with L=2, it should arrive in P5's resolution and be visible in P6's status, but on-hand is 0, suggesting it either hasn't arrived yet (potential L=3) or arrived after the P5 demand. Pipeline inventory is currently 718 (P1: 308 lost, P3: 172, P4: 238, P5: 0). Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - pipeline, and pipeline includes the likely lost 308 units, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the recent regime (188/week) * (L+1) = 188 * 3 = 564. To offset the 'phantom' 308 units in the pipeline that will never arrive, I will add them to the mu_hat to force the OR backend to place an order: 564 + 308 = 872. L remains 2 (promised), as P2 proved L=2 is possible.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (Feb 25) potentially delayed or lead time fluctuates; P1 order (308 units) now 5 weeks overdue and confirmed lost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU 399223001 (Curvy Jeggings) is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The Period 1 order is confirmed lost. The Period 3 order (ordered 2019/2/25) should have arrived in Period 5 or 6 (promised L=2), but is now overdue by 2 periods, suggesting a potential lead time of 4+ periods or a second lost shipment. The Period 4 order (ordered 2019/3/4) is also now at its promised arrival date but hasn't arrived. I am increasing 'L' to 3 'explicitly' to account for these delays and to increase the base stock level (safety stock) to compensate for unreliable shipping. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 3: Average demand P3-P6 is roughly 191 ((199+177+188+201)/4). I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized lower demand while maintaining responsiveness to recent variability. In-transit is high (872) due to overdue orders, which will dampen current ordering in the OR backend to prevent overstocking if everything arrives at once.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (Feb 25) significantly overdue (L >= 4), reinforcing high lead time volatility or additional lost shipments. Demand regime remains stable at ~191 units/period since Period 3.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand jumped significantly in Period 7 (343 units), possibly due to spring seasonality for Curvy Jeggings. The lead time situation is critical: the P1 order (308 units) is confirmed lost. The P3 order (172 units) is now overdue (L=5+). The P4 order (238 units) is also overdue (L=4+). The only reliable arrival was the P2 order with L=2. This indicates high risk of lost shipments or extreme lead time volatility. Given the 872 units in-transit (P1: 308, P3: 172, P4: 238, P6: 154), and the fact that 308 are likely lost, the effective pipeline is much lower. I will set L to 3 to reflect the observed delays and increase mu_hat to handle both the demand spike (343) and the supply instability. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the recent high demand while acknowledging the previous lower regime, resulting in a balanced forecast of approximately 220 units per period (multiplied by 1+L).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 7 (343 units), potentially signaling spring seasonality for apparel. Lead time instability continues: multiple orders (P3, P4) are now 2+ periods overdue, suggesting L is frequently >= 4 or shipments are being lost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product 'Curvy Jeggings' is experiencing significant inventory stockouts despite recent arrivals. In Period 8, a shipment of 154 units (ordered in Period 6, L=2) arrived but was immediately exhausted by the demand of 237, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand shifted from ~260 in early February to ~188 in March, but is now surging again (Period 7: 343, Period 8: 237), confirming the spring seasonal peak for apparel. Shipment integrity remains a major concern: orders from Period 1 (308 units), Period 3 (172 units), and Period 4 (238 units) are all significantly overdue (L >= 5) and likely lost. The pipeline inventory shown (733 units) includes these lost shipments, which misleads the OR backend's order logic. To compensate, I am setting L=4 explicitly to account for historical volatility and using mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average ~260) to capture the seasonal upturn. By using explicit values, I aim to trigger a larger restock order that overrides the 'inflated' pipeline count and covers the gap left by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal peak confirmed: demand significantly increased in April (Avg ~290) compared to March (Avg ~190). Continued severe shipment losses: P1, P3, and P4 orders (total 718 units) are now confirmed lost at Period 9.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The SKU 'Curvy Jeggings' has entered a spring seasonal demand period. Demand in Period 7 (343 units) and the average demand suggests a base level around 250-290 units per period. However, shipment reliability is extremely poor. Orders from P1, P3, P4, and potentially P5 are missing (718 units previously confirmed lost). Since In-transit (1115) includes these lost units, and the OR backend's capped policy relies on 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit), the backend significantly underestimates the 'order-up-to' level needed because it thinks 1115 units are coming when they are likely not. To force the backend to place an order, I must set the L (lead time) and mu_hat (demand) to values that exceed the ghost pipeline inventory. With 0 on-hand and high demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime and the need to 'cover' for lost pipeline units that will never arrive. Although promised L=2, the effective L must be higher to ensure enough inventory is ordered to combat the stockouts caused by frequent losses.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic shipment loss issues: P1, P3, P4, and P5 orders (approx 890 units) are permanently missing. Backend pipeline calculations are skewed as 'In-transit' counts these lost units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), the system shows 1,003 units in-transit. Based on historical data, we have identified that orders from Period 1 (308), Period 3 (172), Period 4 (238), and Period 5 (0 ordered) are effectively lost or severely delayed. Specifically, P6, P8, and P9 arrived successfully, while P1, P3, and P4 remains missing for 7+ periods. Total phantom inventory calculation: 308 (P1) + 172 (P3) + 238 (P4) = 718 units. This phantom inventory misleads the OR backend into under-ordering because it subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock. To compensate, I must set mu_hat to a level that accounts for both future demand (L+1 periods) and the 718 missing units that the backend won't replace automatically. Historical demand has settled around 200-250 units/period (recent spring average). With L=2, mu_hat needs to cover (1+2)*225 + 718 = 1393. This ensures the backend places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is kept at 2 as recent successful deliveries (P6, P8, P9) confirm that the logistics channel still operates at 1-2 periods when not losing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss quantified: P1, P3, and P4 (total 718 units) are permanently missing, causing a constant 718-unit deficit in the backend's order logic that must be manually offset via \u2018explicit\u2019 mu_hat parameters.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29) shows on-hand inventory at 107 units. Historically, April demand has been high, but last week dropped to 178. We are in a confirmed spring season for Curvy Jeggings. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' pipeline inflation: Orders from P1 (308), P3 (172), P4 (238), and P5 (0) are confirmed lost, totaling 718 phantom units. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from your target base stock. Since 1108 total units are in transit and 718 are lost, the actual valid pipeline is only 390 units (P10: 285, P11: 105). To force an order, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' to override the 718-unit deficit. Using a 3-period lead time estimate (L=2 promised + 1 safety) and an average weekly demand of 220 units (conservative spring average), the required inventory (L+1 periods) is 880 units. To offset the 718 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be calculated as: Forecasted Demand + Ghost Pipeline = 880 + 718 = 1598.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost units: 718 (P1, P3, P4). These units permanently inflate 'In-transit' and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' (Curvy Jeggings) is in Period 13 (2019/5/6). Historical demand samples and recent activity show a seasonal fluctuation, with demand currently averaging around 180-200 units. A critical issue is the presence of 718 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5) that are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 1491 units. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order size. With pipeline_inventory (In-transit + On-hand) standing at 1491, and nearly half of that being lost units (718), the OR engine will under-order or order zero if not corrected. The target inventory for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) at a mean demand of ~195 is approx 585 units + safety stock. Because 'In-transit' (1491) is much higher than 'base_stock', the only way to force an order is to set 'mu_hat' explicitly to offset the lost 718 units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (approx 195 * 3 = 585) + Offset for ghost units (718) = 1303. However, even this might not trigger an order if the OR engine is capped. To ensure we maintain stock for May demand, I am setting mu_hat to 1400 and sigma_hat higher to ensure a robust base stock that accounts for the phantom pipeline. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time of 2 periods found in successful deliveries.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (May 13), we faces a critical stockout (On-hand: 0) and a significant systemic pipeline inventory error. My carry-over analysis confirms that orders from Periods 1 (308), 3 (172), and 4 (238) are permanently lost, totaling 718 units. These units remain in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count (Total: 1386), which causes the base-stock policy to severely under-order. To correct this, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these lost units. Demand since Period 9 (seasonal shift) has averaged ~185 units per period. Using a lead time of L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods), the required base stock is roughly 3*185 = 555 units. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 718 units from its calculation, I must provide a mu_hat that covers the real pipeline demand PLUS the lost units to force an order. Since L=2, mu_hat represents (L+1) periods of demand. I will set mu_hat to 1273 (555 base + 718 offset) to neutralize the pipeline error and ensure the system maintains enough physical stock for the current demand regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), we are managing a 'Curvy Jeggings' SKU. History confirms a major systemic issue: shipments from Periods 1 (308 units), 3 (172 units), 4 (238 units), and now likely 5 (0 units, which doesn't add to count, but P5 was a 0 order) are lost. Specifically, P1, P3, and P4 orders totaling 718 units are confirmed lost but are still counted in the backend's 'In-transit' (1003 units). The 1003 in-transit units likely consist of the lost 718 units plus the P10 order (285 units, placed 5 weeks ago and potentially also lost). Recent demand (Periods 11-14) has averaged ~176 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the phantom 'In-transit' inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for the lost units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*176 + 718 = 1246. This ensures the base stock calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) properly accounts for the fact that 718 units in 'pipeline_inventory' do not actually exist.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost units increased to 718 (P1: 308, P3: 172, P4: 238). P10 (285 units) is now 4 periods overdue and potentially lost as well; monitoring P10 arrival. Demand has stabilized at ~176 units over the last 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing a situation with significant systemic inventory loss that skews the OR backend logic. There are 1,003 confirmed or highly likely lost units currently in the 'In-transit' pipeline: P1 (308), P3 (172), P4 (238), and now P10 (285). P10 was ordered on 2019/4/15 and is now five periods overdue, matching the pattern of lost shipments P1, P3, and P4. These 1,003 units permanently inflate the pipeline inventory, causing the OR engine to under-order by exactly that amount if left uncorrected. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) at an average of approximately 168 units. To ensure the backend places an order that covers future demand despite the phantom pipeline units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2) as (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 168 = 504. To force the engine to reach this target while it subtracts 1,003 lost units from its calculation, I set mu_hat to 1,507 (504 + 1,003). This ensures the order logic: (mu_hat - pipeline) = (1507 - 1003) = 504 units before on-hand adjustments. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to reflect the recent demand volatility and maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: P10 order (285 units) confirmed lost; total lost units inflating In-transit now 1,003 (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand regime stable at ~168 units per period (P11-P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU '399223001' is out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The primary challenge is the significant inflation of 'In-transit' inventory due to lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P1 (308), P3 (172), P4 (238), and P10 (285) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,003 units. These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation but will never arrive, causing the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Recent demand (P11-P16) has stabilized at an average of 161 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total expected demand over the (L+1) horizon is 3 * 161 = 483 units. To negate the 1,003 'ghost' units in the pipeline and target 483 real units, I set mu_hat = 483 + 1003 = 1486. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect recent volatility during this stable period.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost units: 1,003 (P1: 308, P3: 172, P4: 238, P10: 285). Demand regime stable at ~161 units/period over the last 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-227.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable but at a lower level, averaging approximately 130 units per period over the last three weeks (P15-P17: 138, 122, 102). A total of 1,003 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10) but remain in the 'In-transit' figure (1,055). These phantom units prevent the OR backend from ordering because it believes pipeline inventory is sufficient. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Lost Units). Desired Base Stock for a target lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) at a demand of ~130 is 390. Adding the 1,003 lost units, the mu_hat should be approximately 1,393. With 329 on-hand and 1,055 in-transit (effectively 52 real units + 1,003 lost), the backend logic: base_stock (1393) - pipeline (1055) = 338. After subtracting on-hand (329), the resulting order will be minimal or zero, which is appropriate given the current high on-hand stock (329) relative to low demand (102). I will monitor if demand continues to drop or stabilizes.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand has consistently stabilized at a lower regime following the April seasonal peak. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the average demand is 132 units/period, with high stability (std approx 26). Lead times for recently arrived orders (P11, P12, P15, P16) have been 1 or 2 periods, confirming the lead time has returned to the promised range, though systemic shipment losses persist. The 'In-transit' count of 1064 includes 1,003 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a (L+1) horizon of 3 periods (using L=2). Base stock = \u03bc(L+1) + z*\u03c3\u221a(L+1). With profit=1 and holding=1, q=0.5, so z=0. Expected demand for 3 periods = 3 * 132 = 396. To offset the 1,003 lost units, I set mu_hat = 396 + 1003 = 1399. Sigma is set based on the recent stable regime (std ~26) over 3 periods: 26 * sqrt(3) \u2248 45.

The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 111 units, significantly lower than the previous regime. Lead times have shown some volatility (mixing 1 and 2 periods), but the promised 2 periods remains a safe operational baseline. A major issue persists with 'ghost' inventory: orders P1 (308), P3 (172), P4 (238), and P10 (285) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,003 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline according to the OR engine, causing it to under-order by exactly that amount. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to (Expected Demand \xd7 (L+1)) + Lost Units. With L=2 and Expected Demand \u2248 111, the calculation is (111 * 3) + 1003 = 1336. I will use the explicit method to ensure the backend places orders that cover actual demand while accounting for the stalled pipeline. Sigma_hat is set relatively low reflecting the stabilized low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: average decreased from ~168 to ~111 units/period (-34%) over the last 5 periods. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remain at 1,003 (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' has transitioned into a lower stable regime, averaging approximately 111 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P16-P20). The date is 2019/7/1, typically a mid-summer period for apparel where heavy denim demand might soften before pre-fall collections. We observe systemic shipment losses totaling 1,003 units (P1: 308, P3: 172, P4: 238, P10: 285) which remain in 'In-transit'. The current In-transit is 1192, meaning only 189 units (P17, P19, P20 orders) are actually viable. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Formula: (1+L) * Forecast + Lost Units. With L=2, the total requirement is 3 * 111 + 1003 = 1336. Using 'explicit' allows me to bypass the backend's default pipeline deduction logic by providing a target 'base stock' that accounts for the lost units. Sigma is set based on recent volatility in this lower regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' (Curvy Jeggings) is experiencing a sustained lower demand regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 91 units per period (P17-P21). Current inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,240 is heavily distorted by 1,003 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Subtracting these lost units from the pipeline (1,240 - 1,003) leaves 237 physical units in transit (P17, P19, P20, P21). To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite the 'ghost' inventory, I must set mu_hat to explicitly account for the lost volume. Desired pipeline for (L+1)=3 periods at 91 units/period is ~273 units. With 237 units truly in transit, the OR backend needs to see a requirement shift. I will set mu_hat = (Forecast * (L+1)) + Lost_Units = (91 * 3) + 1003 = 1276. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the lost units. Lead time L is set to default (2) as recent arrivals (P17, P18, P19) show L=1 or L=2, suggesting localized stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower: Period 17-21 average is 91 units/period (-46% vs previous regime). Lost units remains 1,003.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' is experiencing a sustained low-demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged approximately 100.5 units (102, 109, 85, 48, 111, 146). The most recent few periods suggest a slight upward variance, but remain far below the spring peaks. We will use a demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the last 6 periods (N=6). Lead time is generally 2 periods, though occasionally 1. We stick to the default promised lead time of 2. A critical issue remains: the 'In-transit' pipeline includes 1,003 confirmed lost units (P1: 308, P3: 172, P4: 238, P10: 285). The current 'In-transit' is 1,254, meaning active valid pipeline is only 251 units (1,254 - 1,003). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 'ghost' units, we use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (mu_per_period * (L+1)) + Lost_Units. With mu=101 and L=2, mu_hat = (101 * 3) + 1003 = 1306. This ensures the engine sees the pipeline as insufficient to cover both the demand and the 'dead' units it thinks it has.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 22-23) has stabilized at approximately 146 units/period, following a lower regime. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1222 units is severely inflated by historical lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10) totaling 1003 units. These units will never arrive but the OR engine counts them as inventory, leading it to under-order. To correct for this, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS a manually calculated offset to nullify the 1003 'ghost' units in the pipeline. With a projected demand of 146 units per period and L=2 (Review + Lead = 3), the required base stock is target = ((3 * 146) + 1.64 * (std * sqrt(3))). However, to counteract the 1003 lost units that the engine thinks we have, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a value that forces the order logic to ignore the 1003 units. Total Target = (146 * 3) + 1003 = 1441. I will set mu_hat such that the base stock exceeds the ghost pipeline sufficiently.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at 146 units/period (Periods 22-23). Total confirmed lost units inflating In-transit remains 1,003.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand has dropped significantly in the most recent period (60 units), though the average for Periods 22-24 is approximately 117 units. Based on historical data from Period 1 to Period 24, we have confirmed that a total of 1,003 units are permanently lost (P1: 308, P3: 172, P4: 238, P10: 285). These 1,003 units remain in 'In-transit' (1,450 total), causing the OR backend to believe the pipeline is healthier than it is. To compensate for this, I must manually offset 'mu_hat'. The target inventory position (Base Stock) should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and a current demand regime estimated at ~120 units/period, the Base Stock should be approximately 3 * 120 = 360 units. However, the backend sees 1,450 units in transit (of which only 447 are 'real': P17, P18, P19, P20, P21 are arrived or accounted; remaining real pipeline is P22:36, P23:52, P24:228 - note P22 and P23 arrived in P23/24 context, let's re-verify). Actually, in-transit is 1,450. Real valid in-transit is 1,450 - 1,003 = 447 units. If the backend sees 1,450, it will not order anything unless mu_hat is set above 1,450. To force a base stock of roughly 480 (for safety), I set mu_hat to 1450 (the ghost inventory) + 240 (desired buffer) = 1690. Given the high volatility and lost orders, I will use 'explicit' to ensure the OR engine maintains a safety stock above the 'ghost' inventory level.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; lost units remain 1,003, inflating the 'In-transit' pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 26 (Aug 5). Demand has been volatile: Period 24 saw 60 units, and Period 25 saw 112 units. I'm targeting a stable demand forecast of approximately 140 units per period based on the recent average of Periods 22-25. The primary issue is systemic order loss: P1, P3, P4, and P10 (total 1,003 units) are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline. This creates a massive artificial inventory surplus that prevents the OR backend from ordering. To fix this, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + Lost units = (1+2)*140 + 1003 = 1423. This offsets the ghost units and triggers an order to meet real demand. sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 27 (mid-August). Demand has shown significant volatility: Periods 24-26 record 60, 112, and 182 units respectively, with an average of 118. However, looking at the broader August/Late-Summer window, a baseline of ~130 units/period is more representative of the recent trend before the Period 26 spike. Lead time remains erratic; the P23 order arrived with L=3. Most critically, the pipeline (In-transit: 1598) is severely inflated by historical lost shipments. Confirmed lost units: P1 (308), P3 (172), P4 (238), P10 (285). These 1,003 units will never arrive but effectively 'block' the OR engine from ordering more. To counter this, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock (BS) for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) as: (3 * 130) + z*sigma. With profit and holding cost both $1, the critical ratio is 0.5 (z=0). Targeted BS is ~390 units. The backend order logic is: Order = BS - (In-transit - Lost Units) - On-hand. To trick the backend into ordering correctly, I set mu_hat = Targeted BS + 1003 (Lost units). mu_hat = 390 + 1003 = 1393.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Confirmed that L=3 is a recurring risk (P23 order). Total confirmed lost units inflating 'In-transit' remains 1,003 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand showing high late-summer volatility (Range 60-182).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' continues to suffer from a systemic backend inflation of 'In-transit' units due to permanently lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10), totaling 1,003 units. These lost units represent 71.7% of the currently reported in-transit stocks (1,398). If 'mu_hat' is set using defaults, the OR engine will subtract these phantom units from its target and place zero orders, leading to stockouts as evidenced by the low on-hand inventory (7 units). Demand has shown a significant recovery in August (Periods 25-27: 112, 182, 193), averaging 162 units/period, compared to the July low of 91. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover the next 3 periods (L=2 + 1), I calculate mu_hat explicitly. Target Pipeline = (L + 1) * Demand_rate. With L=2 and Demand_rate \u2248 162, the target is 486. To bypass the 1,003 lost units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to Target + Lost_Units = 486 + 1003 = 1489. This forces the engine to order the true requirement. Lead time L=2 is maintained as the default, but sigma is kept reasonably high to handle August volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Curvy Jeggings' is currently entering the late August/early September transition. Demand has consistently trended upward over the last 3 periods (182, 193, 200), averaging 192 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1,482 units is severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P1: 308, P3: 172, P4: 238, P10: 285) totaling 1,003 units. Additionally, the P24 order of 228 units (placed 2019/7/22) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, bringing the total lost units in the pipeline to 1,231. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be set 'explicitly'. I calculate the required order for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3 reviews) using the current demand average of 192: target inventory = 3 * 192 = 576. Real pipeline = current In-transit (1482) - lost units (1231) = 251. Real stock position = On-hand (0) + Real pipeline (251) = 251. Required order = 576 - 251 = 325. Since the backend performs 'base_stock - In-transit', I must set 'mu_hat' such that 'mu_hat - 1482 = 325'. Thus, mu_hat = 1807. I set L to default (2) and sigma_hat based on the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed P24 order (228 units) lost; total lost units in 'In-transit' pipeline now 1,231 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24). Late August demand stabilized at ~192 units/period (+30% vs July regime).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' (Curvy Jeggings) is currently entering a high-demand late-summer/early-autumn period. Recent demand (P26-P29) has averaged 178 units/period, a significant increase from the July lows (~91 units). A critical operational issue persists: 'In-transit' inventory is heavily inflated by 1,231 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24). Because the OR backend's 'cap' and 'order' logic subtracts the total pipeline from the target base stock, it constanty under-orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) cycle (where L=2) as 3 * 178 = 534 units. However, to force an order through despite the 1,231 phantom units in-transit, I must set the mu_hat parameter to: Target Base Stock + Lost Units = 534 + 1,231 = 1,765. This ensures the backend produces an order roughly equal to 3 periods of demand. I use L=2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P25) have returned to L=2, though I remain vigilant for L=3 volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand, and the pipeline inventory of 1,723 units is heavily distorted by 1,231 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24). Consequently, the OR engine sees a 'ghost' pipeline of 1,231 units that will never arrive. To ensure the engine orders enough to meet demand, the 'mu_hat' must be set explicitly to: (Forecasted Base Stock) + (Total Lost Units). Based on a recent 4-week demand average of ~189 units and a lead time of 2, the desired base stock is roughly (2+1) * 189 = 567 units. Adding the 1,231 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1,798. This forces the engine to target 1,798 total units (on-hand + pipeline), which effectively targets 567 real units. Lead time is kept at default (2) as recent arrivals (P25, P28) returned to the promised schedule, despite the occasional L=3 risk noted in Period 27. Demand has clearly trended upward in late August/early September, so recent_N is used for sigma_hat to capture this increased volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has surged significantly in the last two weeks (P30: 225, P31: 328), marking a clear transition into a high-demand fall regime. The average demand over the last two periods is 276.5 units. Regarding the supply chain, systemic shipment losses remain a critical issue. Confirmed lost units are: P1 (308), P3 (172), P4 (238), P10 (285), and P24 (228), totaling 1,231 units that permanently inflate the 'In-transit' figure (1,798 - 1,231 = 567 actual units in transit). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock based on the new demand level (avg ~277) and a lead time of 2. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mu = 3 * 277 = 831. To force the engine to order correctly, the input mu_hat must satisfy: mu_hat - lost_units = target_base_stock. Thus, mu_hat = 831 + 1231 = 2062. I use 'calculate' for lead time as recent arrivals (P28, P25) have mostly returned to the 2-period promise, though the backend will average historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand surge confirmed starting Period 30: average increased to ~277 units/period (+44% vs August). Total confirmed lost units inflating 'In-transit' pipeline now 1,231 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-09-23. We are in a confirmed fall demand surge (September average: 303 units). The 'In-transit' pipeline (1987 units) is heavily distorted by 1,231 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24). Consequently, the OR backend sees a 'ghost' pipeline of 1,231 units, causing it to under-order significantly. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Calculation: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Lost_Units_Correction. With L=2, (1+2)*303 + 1231 = 909 + 1231 = 2140. For sigma_hat, I use a sample of 5 to capture the high volatility seen during this manual correction phase and the recent demand surge.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223001' is in a high-demand fall regime (starting Period 30), with the last four demand samples being 225, 328, 356, and 401 (Avg: 327.5). The 'In-transit' pipeline is severely inflated by confirmed lost orders. Based on carry-over insights, orders from P1 (308), P3 (172), P4 (238), P10 (285), and P24 (228) are lost, totaling 1,231 units. Additionally, the P29 order (325 units) is now 5 periods old with no arrival, and the P32 order (264 units) has not arrived yet. Given the pattern of shipment loss, I am treating P29 as lost, bringing the total 'phantom' inventory to 1,556 units. The backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will subtract these 1,556 units, leading to zero orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them. To ensure an order is placed that covers the next 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3), I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * 3) + Phantom Units = (327.5 * 3) + 1556 \u2248 2539. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the high volatility of the current fall peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: P29 order (325 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods of non-arrival; total lost units inflating 'In-transit' now 1,556 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29). Demand regime continues to accelerate, exceeding 400 units in P33.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in a confirmed fall demand surge for 'Curvy Jeggings', with demand averaging ~342 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34). The OR engine's 'In-transit' figure is currently 2,539 units, which includes 1,556 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29). These lost units must be excluded to allow the backend to order effectively. The true pipeline consists of orders from P32 (264 units), P33 (153 units), and P34 (399 units), totaling 816 valid in-transit units. My 'explicit' mu_hat must account for the 3-period coverage (L+1) plus an offset for the 1,556 lost units essentially clogging the pipeline. Calculation: Target Stock = (1+L) * Forecast + Lost Units. Using L=2 and forecast=350: (3 * 350) + 1556 = 2606. This ensures the OR engine calculation [Stock - InTransit] results in placing an order that covers actual demand needs.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed lost units inflating 'In-transit' pipeline increased to 1,881 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29). Demand regime for fall stabilized at ~340 units/period. Pipeline remains severely skewed by missing shipments.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019, which is a high-demand period for denim/trousers as cooler weather settles in. Historical data confirms a fall surge (Avg P31-P35 \u2248 326 units). A major operational challenge exists: a total of 1,881 units across multiple orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29) are now confirmed lost or permanently missing, but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' pipeline. With On-hand = 2 and In-transit = 2,342, the OR engine believes the pipeline is full (Pipeline = 2,344). However, the 'Effective Pipeline' is only 2,344 - 1,881 = 463 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to meet demand, the mu_hat parameter must be manually set using the 'explicit' method. For L=2, the target inventory (base stock) should be approximately (L+1) * Mean_Demand \u2248 3 * 326 = 978. Because the OR engine subtracts the full 2,344 from the base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets this 1,881-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Base Stock (978) + Lost Units (1,881) = 2,859. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed lost units inflating 'In-transit' pipeline increased to 1,881 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29). These units remain in the pipeline indefinitely and must be manually offset by increasing mu_hat to prevent systemic under-ordering during the fall peak.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (October 21, 2019), the demand for jeggings remains high during the fall season, averaging ~317 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P32-P36). However, the backend 'In-transit' pipeline (2637 units) is severely inflated by multiple confirmed lost shipments. I have identified 1,881 units as permanently lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29). Subtracting these lost units, the 'true' pipeline is approximately 756 units (2637 - 1881). The OR backend calculates the order as: base_stock - pipeline. To prevent the 1,881 ghost units from suppressing needed orders, I must manually offset them by increasing mu_hat. Following the logic 'base_stock = (1+L) * Forecast', I set the forecast to equal the expected weekly demand (~320) PLUS the correction for lost units per period of the lead time cycle (1881 / (1+L)). With L=2 (promised), (1+L)=3. Correction per period = 1881 / 3 = 627. Total mu_hat target = (320 + 627) * 3 = 2841. I use 'explicit' to force this correction. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current peak season.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-10-28. Demand reflects a sustained fall peak for Curvy Jeggings, averaging ~324 units/period over the last 8 periods (P30-P37). Systemic shipment losses continue to be the primary challenge; total confirmed lost units now stand at 1,881 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29). These units remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline indefinitely, which tricks the OR engine into thinking there is sufficient inventory coming and causes it to under-order or not order at all. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. The base forecast is 324 * (1 + L). With L=2, base mu_hat = 972. To offset the 1,881 phantom units in the pipeline, I add 1,881 to the base forecast, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 2,853. This forces the OR engine to account for the truth: that nearly 1,900 units it 'expects' will never arrive. Lead time remains volatile but averages near 2; I will use L=2 (default) and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high variance during this peak season.

Current date is 2019-11-04 (Period 39), heading into the late fall/pre-holiday season. The demand regime for the fall (since Period 30) has been strong and relatively stable, averaging 316 units per period. The pipeline 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by confirmed or highly probable lost shipments. Based on history, orders from Periods 1(308), 3(172), 4(238), 10(285), 24(228), 29(325), and now likely 34(399) are lost, as they are significantly beyond the promised lead time of 2. Summing these (308+172+238+285+228+325+399) total 1,955 lost units currently counted in the OR engine's 'In-transit' balance (reaching 2,649). Since the backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, it will significantly under-order unless we explicitly offset this by increasing mu_hat. Using the recent demand average (last 9 periods) of ~316 per period, and a lead time of 2, the expected mu_hat should naturally be (1+2)*316 = 948. Adding the 1,955 lost units as an offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 2,903. This forces the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom 1,955 units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time, and sigma_hat uses recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: P34 order (399 units) confirmed lost; total lost units inflating In-transit now 1,955 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, P34). Fall demand regime remains strong, averaging ~316 units/period since Period 30.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11, entering the peak fall/winter retail season. Demand remains strong, averaging 316 units/period since Period 30. There is a systemic issue with lost shipments; confirmed lost units are P1 (308), P3 (172), P4 (238), P10 (285), P24 (228), P29 (325), and now P34 (399), totaling 1,955 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline indefinitely, causing the OR engine to think supply is higher than it is. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: Target Inventory = (L+1) * forecast_demand + lost_units. With L=2, L+1=3. Forecast demand is ~316. Target = (3 * 316) + 1955 = 2903. This ensures the engine orders enough to cover actual demand despite the pipeline inflation. Sigma_hat is set to 125 (approx std in this peak regime) to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: P34 order (399 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods; total lost units inflating In-transit now 1,955 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, P34). Demand is stable at high-fall levels of ~316 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for 'Curvy Jeggings' has been strong during the fall peak, averaging approximately 316 units/period since Period 30. However, the last two periods (P39-P40) show a slight cooling to 245 and 216 units respectively, which is expected as the season progresses. The most critical factor is the systemic 'In-transit' inflation. Historical 'conclude' messages confirm that P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, and P34 shipments never arrived and are over 5 periods old; these units (totaling 1,955) are permanently stuck in 'In-transit' as they never conclude. The backend OR logic uses a 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' formula; since pipeline includes these 1,955 lost units, it under-orders. To fix this, I set 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. I forecast demand for the (L+1) window at ~260 units per period (balancing recent cooling with the fall average). For a 3-period window (promised L=2 + review), this is 780 units. I then ADD the 1,955 lost units to this target, resulting in 2,735. This ensures the backend orders enough to meet real demand despite the phantom inventory. I use L=3 to reflect the frequent delays observed in periods 26, 35, 36, and 39.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 1,955 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, P34) is confirmed. These units indefinitely inflate the 'In-transit' pipeline and must be manually offset by increasing mu_hat by +1,955 to prevent stockouts.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, late in the fall season. Demand has been relatively high, averaging 262 units over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), but appears to be trending slightly lower recently (241 in P41, 216 in P40). The total confirmed lost units inflating the 'In-transit' pipeline has reached 1,955 (comprising P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, P34). Because the OR backend's capped base-stock policy subtracts 'In-transit' units from the target stock without realizing those orders are lost, it will significantly under-order unless we manually offset the mu_hat. To compensate, I calculate a base mu_hat on (1+L) periods of demand ([1+2]*262 = 786) and add the 1,955 lost units to essentially 'neutralize' the phantom pipeline, totaling 2,741 units. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised value, while sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility to ensure a narrow but safe buffer.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. We are in the peak late-fall/holiday season. Period 42 showed a significant demand spike of 447 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales for this jegging SKU. The 'In-transit' pipeline currently shows 2,674 units. However, based on longitudinal tracking, 1,955 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, P34) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually only 719 units (2,674 - 1,955). Specifically, we are waiting for P40 (245 units), P41 (48 units), and P42 (247 units). The backend OR engine incorrectly assumes all 2,674 units will arrive; thus, to get the engine to order correctly, I must manually offset this deficit in the mu_hat parameter. I will set mu_hat to (Expected Demand for L+1 periods) + 1,955. Based on the last 5 periods (avg ~295), demand is averaging near 300, but following the P42 spike and holiday season, a forecast of 320/period is prudent. For L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 320) + 1,955 = 2,915. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand spike in Period 42 (447 units) likely linked to Black Friday/Cyber Monday. Pipeline offset remains 1,955 units lost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Demand peaked in Period 42 (Nov 25) at 447 units (Black Friday), and then sharply declined to 154 units in Period 43 (Dec 2). This drop is consistent with the post-Cyber Monday lull. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand averaged ~261 units/period, but given the proximity to the holidays, I expect demand to remain higher than the mid-year average but lower than the Black Friday peak. I will use N=5 for the demand forecast. On the supply side, systemic shipment losses (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, P34) totaling 1,955 units remain stuck in 'In-transit', causing the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes these units are coming. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 261) + 1,955 = 783 + 1,955 = 2,738 units. This prevents the pipeline from blocking new orders. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the post-holiday period after a Black Friday/Cyber Monday spike (447 units in Period 42). Demand is now stabilizing; the average over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is approximately 254 units. However, we must address the massive 'In-transit' figure of 2,622 units. Per historical 'conclude' messages and carry-over insights, orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, and P34 are confirmed lost, totaling 1,954 units. Additionally, the P42 order (247 units) is currently at L=3 and hasn't arrived; if we count it as potentially lost or significantly late, the 'In-transit' inflation is severe. The backend OR logic subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering (ordering 0 because it thinks 2.6k units are coming), I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to add the lost units (1,954) back into the calculation. Target mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 254) + 1954 = 2716. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the late-year volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed P42 order (247 units) did not arrive at L=2; monitoring for L=3 arrival or loss. Total confirmed lost units inflating 'In-transit' remains 1,954 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, P34). Post-peak demand is averaging ~254 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, approaching the end of the holiday peak. Demand has stabilized post-Black Friday at an average of approximately 254 units per period (Periods 43-45). Total confirmed lost units inflating the 'In-transit' pipeline remain at 1,954 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, P34). The order from P42 arrived in P45 (L=3), and P43 arrived in P45 (L=2), indicating lead time remains volatile between 2 and 3 periods. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 1,954 units falsely counted as 'In-transit', I must manually offset the mu_hat. Using a forecast of 254 units/period and an assumed lead time (L) of 2, the required total coverage (L+1) is 3 periods * 254 = 762 units. Adding the 1,954 lost unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 2,716. I set L to 2 (promised) but use the explicit mu_hat to handle the pipeline distortion and demand levels. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (scaled for L=2) to handle residual holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: P42 order arrived (L=3), P43 order arrived (L=2); lead time remains volatile between 2-3 periods. Total lost units inflating 'In-transit' pipeline continues to be 1,954.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. We are in a post-holiday demand phase for Curvy Jeggings. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has stabilized around an average of 205 units (154, 214, 258, 193). The systemic issue of lost shipments remains: orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P24, P29, and now P34 are confirmed lost, totaling 1,954 units. These units permanently reside in the 'In-transit' pipeline (2,486 units), making the OR engine believe we are overstocked. To correct this, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat with the logic: mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=3 (as lead times consistently fluctuate between 2-3 periods), mu_hat = (4 * 205) + 1,954 = 2,774. This ensures the OR engine places orders despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to 150 to manage high volatility.
