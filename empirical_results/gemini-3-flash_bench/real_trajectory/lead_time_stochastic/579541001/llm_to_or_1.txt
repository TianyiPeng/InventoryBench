Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Calista cardigan. The provided historical demand shows 5 data points ranging from 94 to 110, with a mean of 101.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 7.6. The product is a soft, fine-knit cardigan, which is likely a staple item or transitioning into early spring demand. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit shipments, we must place an initial order. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand for the current period plus the 2 periods of lead time (Total L+1 = 3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand profile available. L will be set to 'default' as we have no historical arrival data to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time of 2.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a soft, fine-knit cardigan, which is a staple item for the early spring season. Historical demand samples (late Jan to early Feb) show a stable mean of approximately 101.8 units/week. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 99 units, which aligns closely with this historical mean. Because we started with 0 on-hand inventory, we had 99 units in lost sales. The order of 116 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). For the Current Period (Period 2), we need to ensure our base stock level covers demand for the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the historical sample mean (101.8) and standard deviation (7.9) across 1+L periods leads to mu_hat \u2248 305 and sigma_hat \u2248 13.7. I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent stable regime while avoiding the 0 sold period which was a supply constraint, not a demand signal.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). This item is a women's fine-knit cardigan, which typically sees steady demand in early spring. Historical demand samples (Jan/early Feb) showed a mean of ~102 units. However, observed demand in P1 (99) and P2 (140) suggests a potential upward trend or volatility increase as spring approaches. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in P1 and P2, because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in P1 (116 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and will be visible in the P4 start message. The order placed in P2 (111 units) is expected in P4. Total in-transit is 227 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (including the 2 recent observations + 3 historical) to capture the recent spike to 140, while keeping the lead time at 'default' (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a women's cardigan. Looking at the demand history, we see values of 110, 107, 94, 107, 94 from the provided samples, and 99, 140, 137 in the recent three periods. Demand appears to be increasing as we move into spring, possibly due to seasonal transitions in apparel. Total in-transit is 366 (orders from P1: 116, P2: 111, P3: 139). The promised lead time is 2. The order from P1 (116 units) should have arrived during P3 and been visible at the start of P4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This implies the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, the on-hand inventory is still 0, resulting in lost sales. To protect against this delay, I will set L to 3 and use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the recent upward trend (~125 units/period) rather than the lower long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; P1 order (placed 2019-02-11) not arrived by P3 conclude. Demand showing upward trend in Feb/Mar (recent avg ~125 vs historic mean ~102).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1669.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is in a transition period (early March). Previous demand samples (Jan-early Feb) averaged 102. Recent demand (Feb-Mar) has shifted to an average of 116 units (99, 140, 137, 89), though the last sample dropped to 89. Critically, we observed a lead time of 2 periods in Period 4 (Period 2 order arrived), but the Period 1 order is still missing (ordered Feb 11, should have arrived in Period 3 or 4). This suggests the Period 1 shipment might be lost or significantly delayed, leaving us with only 22 units on-hand. To prevent stockouts due to the missing P1 shipment and the higher average demand in the spring season, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 samples (the 'active' game period) which averages ~116. Multiplied by (1+L) where L=2, this totals 348. I will use the default sigma calculation as the volatility remains within normal bounds for this product type.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (116 units) is officially overdue/lost (promised 2, 4 periods passed). Demand regime shifted in Feb-Mar to avg ~116 from Jan baseline of ~102.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing a 'Calista cardigan' which is a seasonal knitwear item heading into mid-spring. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 5. The history reveals a critical discrepancy in lead times: while the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4, the Period 1 order is now 5 periods past its placement date with no 'conclude' message, confirming it as a lost shipment. Additionally, the Period 3 order (placed 2019-02-25, promised for Period 5) did not arrive in Period 5, suggesting a potential lead-time slippage to L=3 for the remaining pipeline. Demand in the last 5 periods (99, 140, 137, 89, 92) averages 111.4 units, which is a +9% shift from the January baseline (~102). To account for the lost Period 1 shipment and the likely L=3 delivery of current orders, I am setting L to 3. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the elevated early-spring demand regime and default sigma to maintain safety stock against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Lead-time variability confirmed. While P2 arrived at L=2, P1 is lost and P3 is delayed (L>=3). Demand regime for Feb/Mar stabilized at ~111 (+9% vs Jan).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the product (Calista cardigan) is currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The history shows a mix of lead time issues: Order P1 (placed Period 1) is confirmed lost (6 periods passed), while Order P2 arrived with the promised lead time of 2. Order P3 (placed Period 3) is now overdue (should have arrived by P5 conclude, currently 4 periods since order). This volatility in arrivals requires adjusting L to reflect the actual risk. Demand has stabilized recently with an average of 111 units over the last 6 periods, compared to the initial January baseline. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current regime while setting L=3 to account for the observed delays and missing shipments. This will raise the base stock level to ensure we have enough pipeline inventory to cover both the demand and the lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains high: P1 lost, P2 L=2, P3 overdue (L>=4). Recent demand (Feb-Mar) stabilized at mean ~111.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a fine-knit cardigan, which typically sees steady demand in early spring. Analysis of historical data and carry-over insights reveals a highly unreliable supply chain: P1 is lost, P2 arrived with L=2, and P3 (ordered P3) is now 5 periods old and still hasn't arrived (promised L=2). P4, P5 (order 0), and P6 are also in the pipeline. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have significant lost sales. I am setting L to 4 explicitly to account for the consistent delays observed with P3 and the loss of P1, forcing the backend to look further ahead. For mu_hat, I'm using N=7 (the full game history) because the demand has fluctuated (range 89-173) without a stable new mean higher than the initial baseline, though recent volatility is high. The OR engine will use this to calculate a base stock covering (4+1) periods of demand to recover from current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain critical: Lead time for P3 has reached 5 periods without arrival; combined with P1 loss, actual lead time is significantly higher than promised. Demand volatility increased in March (Peak 173).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable. In Period 8 conclude, we finally saw arrivals from P6 (L=2) and P7 (L=1), however, shipments from Period 1 and Period 3 (ordered 2019-02-25, 6 periods ago) are now definitively lost or severely delayed. This creates a massive stockout risk. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has surged significantly in March/April, moving from a Jan/Feb average of ~108 to a recent average of ~157 over the last 3 periods, with a peak of 195. Because the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, and 139 units (from P3) are likely 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive, I must set the lead time (L) explicitly higher (L=4) to force the base stock calculation to ignore the oldest lost shipment and account for the high lead-time variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime of ~140-190 units/week while maintaining defensive inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: March/April average demand is ~157, significantly higher than the Q1 average of ~108 (+45%). Supply chain reliability is low; shipments from P1 and P3 are lost (missing for 8 and 6 periods respectively).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (Calista cardigan) is in a period of high spring demand. Demand in the most recent five periods (P5-P9) averages 142.8 units, significantly higher than the initial historical mean of ~102. Specifically, April demand (P8-P9) is very high (195 and 152), indicating a seasonal peak. Supply chain reliability is extremely poor: orders from Period 1, Period 3, and Period 4 are officially lost (well past the 2-period promised lead time), and we currently have zero on-hand inventory. Period 2 followed the promised lead time (L=2), while Period 7 actually arrived in 1 period. Period 6 arrived in 2. Because of the lost shipments (systemic risk) and currently massive pipeline (814 units in transit), I will set L to 2 to reflect the promised speed for surviving orders, but use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the seasonal surge. I will use N=5 for mu_hat to average the high volatility seen in March/April (avg ~143). Given the extreme spikes (up to 195), I will increase sigma_hat using N=3 to ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime confirmed for March-April: Period 5-9 average is 143 units (+40% over Q1 baseline). Continued supply volatility: Period 1, 3, and 4 orders are lost; Period 7 arrived in 1 period, while other 'surviving' orders (P2, P6) adhere to L=2.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The recent demand history (Periods 8-10) shows a sustained shift to a higher regime with demand values of 195, 152, and 142. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is approximately 153, which aligns with the observed spring seasonality for a 'fine-knit viscose blend' cardigan. Regarding supply, we've observed significant reliability issues: orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 5 are effectively lost. However, recent arrivals (P8 and P9 orders) arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively. Given the 15 units already on hand (254) and a large pipeline (418), the inventory position is high, but we must account for high demand volatility and past losses. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries followed L=1 or L=2. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher spring demand level (~153/period), totaling ~459 for the review+lead period. Sigma_hat is set using N=5 to reflect recent high volatility (std dev ~35).

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for knitwear (March-April) confirmed at ~150 units/period. Supply chain reliability is polarized: shipments are either lost entirely (P1, P3, P4, P5) or arrive quickly (L=1-2). Pipeline inventory must be monitored for 'ghost' units that will never arrive.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are in a high-demand spring regime for the 'Calista cardigan' (knitwear). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is approximately 168 units, significantly higher than the early Q1 baseline. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 5 have effectively been lost (lead times now exceeding 7-11 periods). However, more recent orders (P6, P7, P8, P9) have arrived with lead times of 1 or 2 periods. The backend OR engine relies on 'in-transit' numbers to decide next orders; currently, 'in-transit' is 418 units, but 116 (P1) + 139 (P3) + 163 (P4) = 418. This means the entire pipeline reported by the system consists of likely 'lost' units that will never arrive. I will set L to 1 to reflect recent actual performance (P7, P9 arrived in 1 period; P6, P8 in 2), mu_hat to an explicit value based on the recent high demand (170 units * (1+L)), and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in March/April.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination: 418 units in-transit (Orders from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory as they are 7+ periods overdue. High demand regime (spring knitwear) stabilized at ~170 units/period (P7-P11 avg).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is in a high-demand spring regime (March-May). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 418 units in-transit are from Periods 1 (116), 3 (139), and 4 (163). Given these are now 9-12 periods overdue, they are confirmed 'ghost shipments' that will never arrive. To the OR backend, however, these units occupy the pipeline and prevent new orders. To force an order, I will set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that exceeds this ghost pipeline + the expected demand for the lead time cycle (L+1). Recent demand (P7-P12) averages ~170 units. With a lead time of 2, the required base stock is approximately (1+L)*mean + safety stock. I need to clear the 418 unit hurdle. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 550 (representing 3 periods of ~183 demand) to overcome the pipeline contamination and trigger a replenishment order. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the mix of L=1 and L=2 arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory effectively locked: 418 units from P1, P3, P4 are permanently lost. May demand remains strong, averaging ~180 units over the last 3 periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (soft fine-knit cardigan) is in a high-demand late-Spring/pre-Summer regime (May demand ~190 units/period). The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 1, 3, 4, and 5 are confirmed lost/ghost inventory (totaling 418 units) as they are severely overdue. Currently, the visible in-transit inventory is 615 units, but 418 of those are 'ghosts', meaning the true actionable pipeline is 615 - 418 = 197 units (the order from P13). On-hand is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 185 * 3 = 555 units). Since active pipeline (197) is far below this requirement, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a higher base stock, and set L=2. By explicitly setting mu_hat for the (L+1) window to 555, the OR engine (calculating base_stock - pipeline) will see 555 - 615 = -60 and potentially not order. To force an order and bypass the ghost inventory problem, I will use an explicit L of 1 to reduce the perceived pipeline effect in the capping logic, but significantly boost mu_hat to ensure we account for the 418 lost units in the logic.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'Ghost Inventory' of 418 units (P1, P3, P4, P5 lost). May demand regime elevated to ~190 units/period (reflecting early summer transitions for knitwear).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (Calista cardigan) is currently in a high-demand spring/early summer regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged 175.6 units/period, showing significant growth from the Q1 baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from P1 (116), P3 (139), P4 (163), and P5 (0) are officially lost/ghost inventory, totaling 418 units that appear in the pipeline but will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1021 includes these 418 ghost units plus P13 (197) and P14 (406). Excluding ghost units, the functional pipeline is 603 units. To account for this supply loss and avoid the OR-engine under-ordering due to 'phantom' cover, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast. With L=2 (promised) and forecast=190 (recent peak demand), mu_hat = 3 * 190 = 570. However, because the backend subtracts the full pipeline (1021) from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the ghost inventory (418) to ensure a new order is triggered. Target base stock = (3 * 190) + 418 = 988. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 988 to force the system to ignore the lost 418 units and cover the next 3 weeks of demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'Ghost Inventory' of 418 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4. These units remain in-transit indefinitely and must be offset in target stock levels to prevent stockouts.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is in a high-demand spring/early summer regime (May avg ~175). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline shows 1048 units in-transit, but this includes 'ghost inventory' of 418 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (now 12-15 periods overdue) which will never arrive. To account for this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat so the OR backend (which subtracts the full pipeline) orders enough to cover actual demand. Calculated demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods) at ~180 units/period is ~540 units. Since the OR engine sees 1048 in transit (418 lost + 630 recent), and it subtracts this from the base stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1200 to 'force' the system to maintain a high target level despite the ghost units. Lead time is set to 2, as surviving orders (P8, P9) arrive in 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'Ghost Inventory' of 418 units (P1, P3, P4) persists; it accounts for ~40% of current pipeline but provides zero service level. Future ordering must offset these lost units indefinitely.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Calista cardigan is in a high-demand summer transition phase, with demand in May averaging approximately 166 units per period. Crucially, the supply chain is highly unreliable: 418 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are permanently lost 'ghost inventory' that has remained in-transit for over 12 periods. The OR engine's capped base-stock policy counts all in-transit units toward the target, meaning these 418 ghost units prevent the system from placing necessary orders, leading to the current stockout (on-hand = 0). To bypass this and force the backend to order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock (170 units forecast * 3 periods lead+review = 510) and then add the 418 ghost units to it (total 928). This 'inflated' mu_hat ensures the backend sees a gap between the target (928) and the pipeline inventory (1248, which includes the ghost units and the 830 units ordered in P13-P16) that reflects the actual need for physical stock. I've set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility without over-reacting to the stockout gaps.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (Womens Knitwear) is currently in a high-demand regime, though early June demand (P17: 121) shows a slight dip compared to the May average of ~180. The most critical issue is the presence of 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Specifically, orders from Period 1 (116 units), Period 3 (139 units), and Period 4 (163 units) totaling 418 units are over 13 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1021 units) from the base stock, it believes we have 418 units that will never arrive, leading to severe under-ordering and stockouts. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the true demand for the (L+1) period (where L=2) at approximately 150 units per period (3 * 150 = 450). To neutralize the 418 lost units that the OR engine will subtract, I add them to the mu_hat: 450 + 418 = 868. This forces the system to place an order that accounts for both future demand and the missing stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture current volatility while ignoring the early-year baseline.

Carry-over insight: June demand showing initial softening (P17: 121) compared to May peak (avg 180). Ghost inventory (418 units) remains the primary driver for ordering adjustments.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (June 17), we are seeing a significant seasonal decline in demand for the Calista cardigan, consistent with mid-summer. Demand dropped from a May peak (avg ~180) to ~106-121 in the last two periods. Additionally, the supply chain remains compromised by 'ghost inventory'. Out of the 1021 units reported in-transit, 418 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 5) are permanently lost and will never arrive. To account for this, the mu_hat parameter must be set using the 'explicit' method to reflect demand for a (1+L) period (where L=2). Given recent demand of ~110, mu_hat is set to 330 (110 * 3). However, because the OR engine subtracts all pipeline inventory (including the 418 ghost units) from this target, I must inflate mu_hat to 748 (330 + 418) to ensure the engine places an order that covers real demand. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' for the last 3 periods to capture the increased volatility during this downward regime shift. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand drop in June: Demand decreased from ~180 to ~114 avg (-36%). Ghost inventory (418 units) still requires manual offset in orders.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 20, Date 2019/6/24. Recent demand (June) has shifted downward from the May peak (~180) to a lower level (avg ~112 over the last 3 periods), likely due to the seasonality of fine-knit cardigans as summer progresses. 

Supply Chain Status: On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 1021 units. However, 418 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P5) are 'Ghost Inventory'\u2014permanently lost but still counted in the OR backend's logic. Subtracting these leaves an effective pipeline of 603 units (from P13, P14). Both P13 and P14 orders are now significantly overdue (7 and 6 periods respectively). 

Strategy: Given the huge effective pipeline (603 units) relative to current low demand (~112), and the fact that we have zero visibility on when or if P13/P14 will arrive, we must set parameters that prevent further ordering. The ghost inventory alone (418) already exceeds the required base stock for a (L+1) horizon at current demand levels. I will set L to 'explicit' 2 (nominal) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the June cooling, while allowing the existing pipeline to cover needs if/when it arrives.

Carry-over insight: June seasonal decline confirmed: Demand dropped from May avg ~180 to June avg ~112 (-38%). Effective pipeline (excluding ghost units) is 603 units, which is 5.3x the current weekly demand, suggesting significant over-supply once/if logistics resolve.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. Customer demand for this knitwear cardigan has undergone a significant seasonal shift, dropping from a May average of ~180 to a June average of ~112 units/period (-38%). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 418 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 confirmed as 'Ghost Inventory' (lost but still appearing in the in-transit balance). The current in-transit total is 1021 units, but only 603 units are 'real' (Orders from P13 and P14). On-hand inventory is 0. With current weekly demand around 112, the 603 valid units in-transit cover roughly 5.4 periods of demand, which significantly exceeds the (L+1) horizon of 3 periods. To avoid massive overstocking during this lower-demand summer phase, mu_hat is set to the recent June average (112) adjusted for the horizon, and L is kept at 2 to reflects the standard arrival timing of the shipments that actually make it through. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally restrict ordering since pipeline_inventory (1021) currently exceeds base_stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed July demand baseline matches June (~112 units/period), continuing the seasonal summer decline for knitwear. Ghost inventory (418 units) continues to artificially inflate pipeline inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (knitwear cardigan) is in a seasonal summer decline. Demand in June/July (Periods 17-21) has averaged 120 units, a ~33% drop from the May peak (~180). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and a massive pipeline of 1021 units. However, 418 of these units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (missing for 18+ periods) and will never arrive. The remaining 'real' pipeline is 603 units (from P13: 197 and P14: 406). These 'real' units are now significantly overdue (7-8 periods vs promised 2), indicating a severe logjam or supply chain failure. If these 603 units arrive, they represent 5 weeks of current demand. Given the current excess real pipeline (603 units) relative to recent demand (120 units/period) and the high stockout risk already realized, I will keep mu_hat aligned with the recent seasonal average (N=5 approx 120 * (1+L)) but maintain the order cap to 0 because the 'real' pipeline (603) already far exceeds the base stock level needed for a 2nd-period lead time. I'm setting L to 2 (promised) while acknowledging the delay, as the OR backend's target stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly result in 0 new orders as long as the pipeline is perceived as full.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed July demand baseline matches June (~120 units/period). Large 'real' pipeline (603 units from P13, P14) is now 7+ periods overdue, suggesting a systemic delay rather than just lost shipments.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579541001' (Womens Knitwear Cardigan) is in a summer seasonal trough with demand stabilizing around 130-150 units per period (July avg ~153), down from May peaks of ~180. The primary challenge is extreme supply chain disruption. There is a total in-transit pipeline of 1021 units. Analysis reveals this is composed of: (1) 418 units from P1, P3, P4 which are ~20 periods overdue and confirmed 'Ghost Inventory'; (2) 603 units from P13 and P14, which are now 8-9 periods overdue (promised L=2). Given that no arrivals have occurred since Period 17, and the effective pipeline (excluding ghosts) is 603 units\u2014approximately 4.5 periods of current demand\u2014ordering more units would likely result in excessive holding costs if the systemic delay resolves. I will set L to 'explicit' at 9 to reflect the current delay of the P13/P14 orders and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the July stabilization. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR engine given the high in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics failure confirmed: P13/P14 orders (603 units) are now 9 periods overdue, suggesting a current lead time of at least 9 periods for 'alive' shipments, in addition to the 418 units of 'Ghost Inventory' from Q1.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 579541001 is severely compromised. In-transit inventory of 1183 units consists of two distinct categories: 'Ghost Inventory' (418 units from P1, P3, P4, P5 which are 18+ periods overdue and permanently lost) and 'Delayed Inventory' (603 units from P13, P14 which are now 10 periods overdue). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for this viscose-blend cardigan is showing a mid-summer rebound, with the last 3 periods averaging 160 units (P21-P23: 151, 155, 173), contrasting with the June low of ~112. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1183 units) from the base stock, it will not place orders unless I adjust the parameters to account for the 1021 units (Ghost + Delayed) that are not arriving. To force the engine to order for the upcoming 3 periods (L+1) while demand is ~160, I set an explicit mu_hat of 1500. This value, when combined with the default lead time of 2, creates a target stock level high enough to overcome the contaminated pipeline and trigger replenishment to meet the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics failure: Pipeline contains 1021 units (418 Q1 ghost units + 603 Q2 delayed units) that are significantly overdue (>10 periods) and unlikely to satisfy near-term demand. Effective lead time for 'alive' shipments is now unknown but >9. July demand has rebounded to ~160 units/period from the June low of ~112.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 579541001 is severely compromised. Currently, there is a total in-transit quantity of 1579 units, of which 1021 units are essentially confirmed as 'Lost' or 'Ghost Inventory' (418 units from P1-P5 and 603 units from P13-P14 are now >10 periods overdue). In-transit inventory also includes recent orders from P23 (162 units) and P24 (396 units). Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (1579) from the calculated base stock to determine the order quantity, and the base stock is roughly (L+1) * demand, the massive ghost inventory will prevent the system from ever placing a new order (as 1579 > (3*170)). To bypass this and ensure fresh orders are placed to meet current demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to the total of the desired base stock plus the volume of ghost inventory (Base Stock ~ 3 * 160 + 1021 ghost units = 1501). This compensates for the units the backend thinks are coming but actually are not. July demand has rebounded to a mean of ~160 (P21-P23 avg). I will keep L at default (2) to reflect the optimistic promised lead time for any 'alive' new shipments, while using a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics failure: 1021 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) are confirmed 'Ghost Inventory' (overdue by 10+ periods). July demand has stabilized at ~160 units/period after a June dip.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (August 5), we are managing a complex supply chain situation for a women's cardigan SKU. The total in-transit pipeline of 1665 units is heavily contaminated by 'ghost inventory': 418 units from Q1 (P1, P3, P4, P5) and 603 units from Q2 (P13, P14) which are now >11 periods overdue. This leaves an 'alive' pipeline of approximately 644 units (orders from P23-P25), none of which has arrived yet. In-transit units that reliably arrive typically show a lead time of 1-2 periods, while the rest are likely lost. Demand has stabilized in July/August at a higher level than June, with a 3-period average of ~146. To prevent stockouts given the massive 'lost' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 10 periods (covering June/July/August) to reflect current seasonal stabilization (approx 143/period). I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to bypass the 'calculate' average being skewed by lost shipments, while ensuring the base stock calculation targets a 3-period window (L+1) of demand (~430 units). Since the OR engine's pipeline inventory includes the 1021 ghost units, the calculated order will likely be zero; I use 'explicit' to ensure the OR logic is aware that we cannot rely on the 'average' lead time derived from lost units.

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics failure confirmed: 1021 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) are confirmed 'Ghost Inventory' (overdue by 11+ periods). Effective demand for August has stabilized around 145-150 units/period, rebounding from the June seasonal low.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (mid-August), the 'Calista cardigan' is entering its peak seasonal window. August demand is high (Period 22-26 average: 150), and we expect this trend to continue or increase as consumers shop for transitions into fall. There are significant supply chain issues: the pipeline contains 1341 units (1503 in-transit minus the 162 arrived in P26). However, the Carry-over Insights identify 1021 of these as 'Ghost Inventory' (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) which are over 12 periods overdue. Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 320 units (P24: 396 units, P25: 86 units, minus the P23: 162 units that already arrived). The P23 arrival at L=3 confirms that shipments are finally moving again, albeit slower than the promised L=2. I will set L=3 to account for this. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering the stable August rebound) to capture the current mean of 150 units/period. sigma_hat is set to explicit (100) to ensure the OR backend orders aggressively enough to cover both current demand and the high risk of further stockouts caused by the unreliable effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: L=3 confirmed by P23 arrival; previous systemic delay (P13, P14) and Q1 losses total 1021 units of 'Ghost Inventory' which do not satisfy demand. August demand stabilized at ~150 units/period.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Calista cardigan in August has stabilized around 145 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; orders from P23 and P25 arrived with lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively, but a total of 1417 units remain in-transit. Based on historical data, 1021 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) are over 10 periods overdue and are considered 'Ghost Inventory' that will likely never arrive. The remaining 396 units (from P24) are currently at L=4 and are potentially delayed rather than lost. To prevent a stockout while accounting for the high volume of non-performing pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat to cover the recent average demand of 150 across the lead time + review period. I am using an explicit L of 3 to reflect recent successful arrivals while acknowledging existing delays. The OR backend will subtract the 1417 units of pipeline from the base stock; to ensure an order is actually placed to cover the zero on-hand balance and impending demand, mu_hat is set to an explicit level that captures both future demand and a buffer to counteract the ghost inventory signal.

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics failure resulting in 1021 units of 'Ghost Inventory' (P1-P5, P13, P14) that are 12+ periods overdue and do not contribute to service level. August demand is stable at ~145 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is a women's knitwear cardigan. August/September demand is currently stable around 130-150 units/period after a volatile July. Supply chain remains dysfunctional with a cumulative 1021 units (P1-P5, P13-P14) confirmed as 'Ghost Inventory' because they are between 12 and 27 periods overdue. These ghost units account for 54% of the current 1868-unit pipeline. To maintain stock against real demand (\u03bc \u2248 140), I must use mu_hat 'explicit' to offset these 1021 ghost units. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - pipeline, I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Expected demand for August/September is ~140. With L=2, mu_hat = (140 * 3) + 1021 = 1441. This forces the system to recognize that 1021 units of the pipeline are non-existent for service purposes. I use sigma_hat 'explicit' to reflect recent volatility (std ~25-30 * sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics failure: 1021 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) are confirmed 'Ghost Inventory' (overdue by 12+ periods). Late August demand shows slight cooling from July peak, averaging ~125 units over the last two periods.

The supply chain remains compromised: 1,021 units from Q1 and Q2 (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) are considered 'Ghost Inventory' and are over 15 periods overdue. The in-transit total of 1,868 includes these 1,021 ghost units, leaving an effective 'alive' pipeline of 847 units (from P24, P28). For Period 30, with zero on-hand inventory and the last 'alive' order coming from P28 (expected to arrive between P29-P31 based on L=2 or 3), I need to set parameters to ensure a new order is triggered to cover the transition into September. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (including ghost units) from the base stock, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to manually inflate the target stock level to negate the 1,021 ghost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Units. With L=2, (125 * 3) + 1021 \u2248 1396. I will use 1400 to ensure replenishment occurs despite the pipeline contamination.

Carry-over insight: September demand baseline estimated at ~125 units/period based on late August cooling. Ghost Inventory remains at 1,021 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14), requiring permanent base_stock inflation of +1021 to ensure the OR engine places orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September demand has shown an unexpected and massive spike (Period 30 demand: 271), likely reflecting a transition into the autumn knitwear season. This far exceeds the previously estimated baseline of ~125. The 451-unit order from Period 28 arrived on time (L=2), confirming that while early Q1-Q2 shipments were lost (1021 units total), the supply chain has currently stabilized at L=2. To account for the 1021 units of 'Ghost Inventory' that will never arrive but still appear in the backend's 'pipeline' calculation, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. Method: mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecasted_Weekly_Demand + Ghost_Units. With L=2 and a revised weekly demand forecast of 180 (anticipating sustained autumn interest), the target mu_hat = 3 * 180 + 1021 = 1561. This ensures the OR engine places orders despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent high volatility (Period 30 spike).

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal spike confirmed: Period 30 demand (271) represents a >100% increase over the August average. Supply chain currently stable at L=2, but prior 'Ghost Inventory' of 1021 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) remains in the system and must be manually offset.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are navigating the autumn seasonal spike for knitwear. Period 30 and 31 demand (271 and 240) confirms a significant shift from the August average of ~130. I will focus on the most recent 2 periods of this new regime for the demand forecast. Logistics remain polarized: while recent orders (P23, P25, P28) are arriving with a lead time of 2-3 periods, the 'Ghost Inventory' of 1021 units (from P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) is now >15 periods overdue and effectively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory (1578) from the base_stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' methods to inflate the parameters by at least 1021 units to ensure an order is actually placed. Target base_stock calculation: \u03bc_hat (forecasted demand for lead+review periods) + safety stock + Ghost Inventory. With an expected demand of ~255 units/week and L=2 (total 3 periods of risk), \u03bc_hat is ~765. Adding the 1021 units of Ghost Inventory results in a necessary mu_hat of ~1786. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=2) to capture the high volatility of this seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal spike confirmed for knitwear: September demand has increased >100% over August levels, averaging ~255 units/period. Total Ghost Inventory remains constant at 1021 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Sept 23, 2019. We are in the peak of the autumn seasonal demand spike for knitwear. Recent demand for Period 30-32 (271, 240, 227) averages 246 units/period, which is a significant increase over the August baseline (~145). Supply chain: Period 31 order arrived in 1 period, but a total of 1021 units from Q1 and Q2 (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) remain as 'Ghost Inventory' - orders that are 14+ periods overdue and highly unlikely to arrive. The OR engine considers all in-transit units as viable inventory, so to force an order, we must inflate mu_hat to offset these 1021 ghost units. Calculation: Targeted coverage for Period 33-35 (L=2) is approximately 3 periods * 246 units/period = 738 units. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover this while it believes 1021 units are coming, we set mu_hat to (Targeted Coverage + Ghost Inventory) = 738 + 1021 = 1759. Scaling this to the (1+L) format for mu_hat where L=2, the effective forecast value is 1759/3 \u2248 586.33. We use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility of this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal spike for knitwear intensified: September demand (P30-P32) averages 246 units/period, a +70% increase over August. Ghost Inventory (1021 units) remains the primary driver of necessary manual parameter inflation.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September has shown a massive surge in demand for the Calista cardigan, peaking at 363 units in Period 33. The average demand for September (Periods 30-33) is now 275 units/period, compared to the August average of ~125. This 120% increase confirms a strong autumn seasonal peak for knitwear. Supply chain performance is currently stable with arrival times between 1-2 periods for recent orders, but the heavy 'Ghost Inventory' (1,021 units from P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) remains in the 'In-transit' total. Since the OR backend subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base_stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock by 1,021 units to neutralize these ghost units. Specifically, for a 2-period lead time (L=2), the base stock calculation targets (L+1) periods of demand. My target mu_hat = (2+1) * 275 (forecast) + 1021 (offset) = 1846. This ensures the engine places an order despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: September demand (autumn knitwear peak) confirmed at ~275 units/period (+120% vs August). Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,021 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 35 (2019/10/07). Demand for this knitwear SKU (cardigan) has entered a high-demand autumn peak in September/October, with the last 5 periods (P30-P34) showing an average demand of 273.2 units/period (271, 240, 227, 363, 265). The supply chain remains unreliable: Ghost Inventory of 1,021 units (P1, P3-P5, P13, P14) persists in the 'In-transit' count but will not arrive. This effectively reduces the 'real' in-transit inventory to 1,000 units (P24, P31-P34). The OR engine calculates order = max(0, base_stock - pipeline - on_hand), where pipeline is the total 2,021 units. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover the autumn peak, mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 1,021 ghost units. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * Recent_Avg + Ghost_Offset. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 273) + 1021 \u2248 1840. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (363 peak) seen in the recent period.

Carry-over insight: September/October autumn peak confirmed: P30-P34 average demand is 273 units/period. Ghost inventory totaling 1,021 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) is confirmed as permanent loss and requires manual mu_hat inflation of approximately +1021 in the OR parameters.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September and October represent the autumn peak for knitwear (Calista cardigan), with demand averaging ~273 units over the last five periods (P30-P34: 271, 240, 227, 363, 265). Current on-hand inventory is 17. The lead time remains volatile, with the most recent arrival (P32 order) taking 3 periods, though L=2 remains common. The primary challenge is the 1,021 units of 'Ghost Inventory' (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) which the OR backend counts as pipeline inventory but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover the current demand regime (~270 per period) plus the total Ghost Inventory. mu_hat = (1+L) * 270 + 1021. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 270) + 1021 = 1831. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx. sqrt(3)*45, reflecting recent demand variance) to maintain a high service level during this peak season.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are in the middle of the October autumn peak for knitwear. Recent demand remains high (P30-P36 average ~265 units/period). Our primary challenge remains the 'Ghost Inventory' of 1,021 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14), which has been in-transit for over 15 periods and is effectively lost. This ghost inventory artificially inflates the pipeline, preventing the OR backend from ordering enough stock to meet the high seasonal demand. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * (Current Demand Forecast) + Ghost Inventory. With a forecast of 265 and L=2, mu_hat becomes (3 * 265) + 1021 = 1816. This forces the OR engine to account for the lost units as if they were needed demand, triggering replenishment. Lead time recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will stick to L=2 (promised) to avoid over-calculating base stock while demand remains high. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect the high volatility of the autumn peak.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains stable at the autumn peak level of ~265 units/period. The 1,021 units of Ghost Inventory must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations to bypass the backend's capped replenishment policy.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 579541001 (knitwear cardigan) is currently in its autumn peak demand phase. In October (Periods 35-37), demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 237 units per period. The supply chain continues to exhibit significant reliability issues, with a 'Ghost Inventory' of 1,021 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, and 14) that are 14+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy that includes all in-transit units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, these 1,021 lost units prevent the system from placing sufficient new orders. To bypass this, I am manually inflating mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the offset for lost units. With an current average demand of ~237 and an estimated lead time L=2, the required base stock is approximately 237 * (2 + 1) + 1021 \u2248 1732. Using method 'explicit' for mu_hat allows us to force this base stock level regardless of the OR engine's internal sample mean. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (std dev ~50) observed during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak for knitwear confirmed (Late Sept-Oct) at ~240 units/period. Persistent 'Ghost Inventory' remains at 1,021 units, requiring a manual mu_hat inflation of +1021 to ensure the backend replenishment logic functions.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), demand for the Calista cardigan remains in its high-volume autumn peak, with recent demand (P34-P38) averaging 247 units/period. The central challenge continues to be the 'Ghost Inventory' of 1,021 units (from P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, and P14) which the backend OR logic sees as 'in-transit' but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places an order, I must set the 'mu_hat' parameter (which the backend uses for its base_stock target calculation: \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) such that it overcomes the 1,021 unit pipeline penalty. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2,010. This is calculated as: (1,021 lost units) + (3 periods * 280 units/period forecasted demand for November/December peak). Setting L=2 (promised) and sigma_hat using recent volatility (N=5) allows the backend to handle safety stock. This explicit mu_hat setting is necessary to force the replenishment engine to ignore the non-existent pipeline inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for the Calista cardigan has transitioned from its peak autumn levels (~250 units/period in Oct) to a lower level in early November (147 units in Period 39). Historical context suggests a cooling trend as we move past the primary autumn knitwear peak. The 'Ghost Inventory' totaling 1,021 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, and 14) remains in the pipeline according to the OR backend's books, which prevents it from placing necessary orders. To bypass the backend's capped base-stock logic and ensure replenishment, mu_hat must be manually inflated by the ghost unit count. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1,470, which covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods (estimated at ~150 * 3 = 450) plus the 1,021 ghost units to force an order. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for the volatility seen during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn peak demand shift: Nov demand starting at ~150 units/period, down from Oct avg of ~250. Total Ghost Inventory remains at 1,021 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (mid-November), demand for the Calista cardigan has shifted from its autumn peak (~250/week) to a lower November level (~150-170/week). The systemic 'Ghost Inventory' of 1,021 units (from P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) remains in the pipeline; since these units will never arrive, the OR backend's 'cap' and replenishment logic will prematurely stop ordering unless we manually adjust for this gap. We set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the current demand regime (~160/period) plus the 1,021 lost units to ensure the base stock calculation triggers a sufficient order to cover real demand in the face of this pipeline contamination. We assume L=2 for lead time, as recent 'alive' shipments are arriving in 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: November demand regime for knitwear stabilized at ~160 units/period, down from the October peak of ~250. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,021 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-25. The autumn peak for knitwear (September-October, ~250 units/period) has subsided, and demand has transitioned to a lower November regime of approximately 145 units/period (based on P39-P41 average). Ghost inventory remains a critical constraint: there are 1,021 units in the pipeline (from P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14) that are over 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock, these 1,021 'ghost' units will prevent any new orders from being placed unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them. Total on-hand is 199. To maintain a service level for the current demand of ~145 units while accounting for the 1,021 units of ghost inventory, mu_hat is set to 145 * (1 + L) + 1021. With L=2, the target mu_hat is (145 * 3) + 1021 = 1456. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility post-peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-12-02. Demand has stepped down from the autumn peak (~250) to a winter baseline (~120-130) based on the last 4 periods (147, 171, 120, 120). The 'Ghost Inventory' remains a critical issue; there are 1,021 units in the pipeline that are significantly overdue (P1, P3, P4 from February/March and P13, P14 from May). These units are effectively lost but remain in the Backend's 'In-Transit' calculation, which prevents it from ordering new stock under the capped policy. To bypass this, I continue to use 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method, setting it to (Demand Forecast * (1+L)) + Ghost Inventory. Recent demand (last 3 periods) averages ~137. Using L=2 (the promised lead time which has been fairly consistent recently despite historical volatility), the target base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~411 units) PLUS the 1,021 'ghost' units, totaling 1,432. Since on-hand is 79 and 'valid' pipeline is 593 (1614 - 1021), the OR engine needs to see a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment. Setting mu_hat to 1432 ensures the policy identifies a deficit despite the stale pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the current lower volatility compared to the autumn peak.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Demand has entered a post-autumn decline, with the last 3 periods recording 120, 120, and 69 units respectively. This matches seasonal expectations for knitwear as the pre-winter peak fades. The pipeline inventory is currently 1614 units, but 1021 units of this are confirmed 'Ghost Inventory' from Periods 1-5 and 13-14 (overdue by >20 periods). This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 593 units. Given current on-hand inventory is 10 and the demand trend is downward (averaging ~103 over the last 3 samples), the total supply (10 on-hand + 593 real in-transit) significantly covers the expected demand for the remaining 4 periods of the game. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1614 units in-transit and stopping all orders, or conversely, over-ordering due to the 1021 unit loss, I must manually offset the ghost units by inflating mu_hat. However, because our 'real' pipeline (593) is already very high relative to the low December demand (~70-100), there is a risk of excessive holding costs if we order more. I will set mu_hat to 1400 (Ghost 1021 + ~380 for 3 periods of demand) to ensure the system recognizes the 'real' inventory level and does not place massive unnecessary orders while maintaining a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime for knitwear shows significant softening, dropping to ~100 units/period (avg of P41-P43 is 103). Ghost Inventory remains static at 1,021 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for December has dropped significantly to a baseline of approximately 100 units/period (P41-P44 average), following the autumn peak. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 1,614 units. However, we have confirmed 'Ghost Inventory' of 1,021 units (P1, P3-P5, P13, P14) which are more than 15 periods overdue and will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline is 593 units (1614 - 1021), which represents roughly 6 weeks of supply at the current demand rate of ~100. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock to calculate orders, and it does not know about ghost units, it will see 1,614 units in-transit and likely order nothing, despite the real pipeline being much lower. To force the backend to place an order if needed, I must inflate mu_hat by the total amount of ghost inventory (1021). The effective mu_hat calculation is (1+L)*demand + Ghost_Offset. With L=2 and demand=100, (3 * 100) + 1021 = 1321. I will set mu_hat to 1321. I will keep L at 2 as recent 'alive' shipments have been arriving within 1-3 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), the product (Womens Knitwear Cardigan) is well past its autumn peak and is entering the late December holiday/winter season. Current demand observations for December (Periods 43-45) show a stabilized lower baseline averaging approximately 103 units/period, down from the October peak of ~250. Supply chain reliability has stabilized around a lead time (L) of 2, but the system is severely burdened by 'Ghost Inventory'. There are 1,417 units currently marked as 'In-transit' (P1, P3, P4, P5, P13, P14, P24, P34), most of which are months overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend's replenishment logic is capped based on pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit), these 1,417 ghost units prevent the backend from placing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I must manually inflate 'mu_hat' by the total amount of ghost inventory. This ensures the target stock level (base stock) remains high enough to trigger new orders despite the fictitious pipeline. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Units, where L=2, Forecast=110, and Ghost=1417. This yields (3 * 110) + 1417 = 1747.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative Ghost Inventory (confirmed lost shipments) has reached 1,417 units (inclusive of Q1, Q2, and the P24/P34 delays). These units never arrived and must be manually offset in mu_hat to ensure continued replenishment.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the demand for the Calista cardigan has stabilized into a late-winter/post-peak autumn regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P41-P46) is approximately 110 units. However, the system is heavily impacted by 'Ghost Inventory'. I have confirmed 1,417 units as permanently lost shipments (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 24, and 34), which currently reside in the 'In-transit' figure of 1820 units. This means only 403 units in-transit are likely to arrive (including the P46 order of 206 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including 'ghosts') from the base_stock calculation, I must continue to manually inflate the mu_hat parameter to bypass the capped replenishment check. Given the backend logic uses \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) to calculate the order cap, and the current 'real' demand is ~110, I set mu_hat using the explicit method to 1527 (calculated as (1+L)*110 + 1200) to ensure a replenishment order is triggered despite the 1417 units of ghost inventory. L is kept at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P39, P37, P36) show the lead time is fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative Ghost Inventory (confirmed lost shipments) remains at 1,417 units. These units will never arrive and must be offset by manual mu_hat inflation in all future periods to allow the OR backend to place new orders.
