Evidence of actual lead time will first appear in Period 4's start. 2. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0, and we have 230 units in transit (116 from P1 + 114 from P2). 3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical samples averaged ~102. Recent actual demand in P1 (99) and P2 (140) shows a slight upward trend, potentially due to the transition into spring/February for this 'fine-knit viscose blend' cardigan. Average demand over the last 7 samples is ~108. 4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR suggests 134 units based on a base-stock policy. 5. **Strategy**: Since we have 0 on-hand and have lost sales in P1 and P2 (totaling 239 units), we are currently in a stockout situation until the P1 order arrives later this period. The pipeline (230) plus OR's 134 brings total coverage to 364 units. Given the lead time L=2, we need to cover demand for periods 3, 4, and 5.

This indicates the actual lead time is likely longer than 2 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. 2. Inventory analysis: We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have stocked out for 3 consecutive periods (sold=0 while demand was ~100-140). There are 364 units in transit (P1: 116, P2: 114, P3: 134). 3. Demand analysis: Historical demand was ~100, but recent demand (P1-P3) averaged 125. The product is a 'fine-knit viscose blend cardigan', suitable for the transition from winter to spring (March/April). Demand is likely to remain steady or increase as spring begins. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends only 21 units. This is because it sees 364 units in the pipeline and assumes a 2-period lead time, expecting 116 units to have arrived. Since they haven't arrived, following OR's low number risks a prolonged stockout. 5. Strategy: I will ignore the low OR recommendation.

Product is a 'Calista cardigan', a transition piece for early spring. Current date is March 11.

The item is a 'soft, fine-knit viscose blend cardigan', which is highly relevant for the current March/Spring season. 3. Inventory Strategy: We are currently stocked out. The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 450 units in the pipeline against a base stock level calculation. However, 134 of those units (P3) are overdue and potentially lost like P1.

Curiously, P5 (70 units) arrived in just 1 period. This suggests lead times are erratic, and P3/P4 are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Demand Analysis: Demand has increased recently, spiking to 173 in P7. Historical average (pre-game + history) is approximately 110-120 units. Inventory Analysis: We have 0 on-hand and 620 in-transit. The OR recommends 0 because it counts the 620 units in-transit against its base-stock level. However, given that P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 380 units) are highly likely lost or won't arrive in time to meet immediate demand, our 'effective' pipeline is much lower. If we subtract the unreliable 380 units, the effective pipeline is only 240 units (from P6 and P7). Strategy: We need to replenish stock immediately to capture the high spring demand (April).

Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 380 units) are confirmed lost/missing as they are now 5-8 periods overdue. This explains why 'In-transit' shows 520 units, but real usable pipeline is likely only the order from P8 (140 units). 2. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has spiked significantly (P1-P6 avg ~110; P7-P8 avg ~184). As we move into April, demand for a light cardigan ('soft, fine-knit viscose blend') is likely entering a seasonal peak. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 45. Effective pipeline is 140 (P8), expected to arrive in P9 or P10. The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 520; however, 380 of those are phantom units. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a mean demand of ~150-180, we need approx 450-540 units total. Current real stock + real pipeline = 45 + 140 = 185. Deficit is ~300 units.",

Demand Analysis: The date is 2019-04-15 (Mid-Spring). The product is a fine-knit cardigan, which is a key transitional piece for Spring. Demand has shifted from a mean of ~110 to ~184 since Period 7 (+67%). Most recent demand was 152 despite a stockout. Period 10 is current, and I must cover demand for Period 10, 11, and 12 (L+1). 3. Inventory: Current on-hand is 0. Visible in-transit is 660, but 380 units (P1, P3, P4) are lost. Valid pipeline is P8 (140) and P9 (140), totaling 280. 4.

In-transit consists of P1, P3, P4 (confirmed lost/380 total) and P10 (260 units ordered just last period). Since P1, P3, and P4 are considered lost, the effective pipeline is only 260 units. \n4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 0 units because it counts the lost orders in the pipeline (In-transit: 640). If we exclude the 380 lost units, the OR logic would see a much higher need.

Orders from periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 13 (a total of 150 + 134 + 130 + 260 + 280 = 920 units) are significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time and are likely lost. Current 'In-transit' of 1480 units is heavily inflated by these zombie orders. Accounting for these losses, the functional pipeline includes P14 (280), P15 (280), and P16 (0), totaling 560 units. Demand Analysis: The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 7 (from ~110 to ~180). Recent demand (P11-P16) averages 176 units/period. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated pipeline (1480 units); however, zero units on-hand and a high stockout rate (4 consecutive periods of 0 ending inventory) require immediate action. I need to maintain enough stock to cover L+1 (3 periods) of demand (~540 units). Since P14 and P15 are expected to arrive in P17 and P18 respectively (totaling 560 units), the pipeline is theoretically sufficient IF they arrive.

The functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (280 units), P18 (260 units), and the order I place now.

However, with only 53 units on hand and a 2-period lead time, I must order to cover the (L+1) window.

With current demand averaging ~145 over the last 12 periods, a base stock for 3 periods should be around 435-500.

The OR recommendation is 0, based on current on-hand inventory levels and a standard base-stock calculation. Given that there are only 5-6 weeks left (ending Period 47), and we still have 347 units on-hand against a recent demand average of ~146 units over the last 3 weeks, we have roughly 2 periods of coverage on-hand. There is a single functional incoming shipment from P38 (250 units) that has not arrived yet (ordered P38, currently P42, lead time varies 1-3 periods). If that P38 order arrives, our total stock will be ~597 units, which is more than enough to cover the rest of the game. Even if P38 is lost, 347 units cover 2+ weeks of demand.

  "rationale": "The SKU (soft knit cardigan) is entering December, signaling the end of the Fall peak and a transition into a potentially lower demand regime as seen in recent weeks (120 units/period, down from ~270). Current on-hand inventory is 227 units. In-transit arrivals from Period 34 and Period 38 (totaling 600 units) are technically overdue but cannot be relied upon given the extensive history of lost shipments (over 2000 units lost). However, lead times for recent successful arrivals have been 1-3 periods. Even if we treat the entire pipeline as lost, the existing 227 units on-hand provide nearly 2 full periods of coverage at the current demand rate of ~120 units. Ordering now (Period 43) with a 2-period lead time would mean arrivals in Period 45. Given the game ends at Period 47, we need to be careful about overstocking and incurring holding costs ($1/unit). The OR recommendation of 0 units is appropriate because on-hand stock is sufficient for immediate needs (Periods 43 and 44), and any new order placed now would only serve the very final 2 periods of the game, where demand is likely to remain at or below the current level. If demand holds at 120, we sell 120 in P43 (leaving 107) and sell the rest in P44. I will follow the OR recommendation of 0 to maximize profit and minimize year-end holding costs.",

We have 158 units on-hand and 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P44-P47). Given the current stock of 158 units and the declining demand trend (most recently 69 units), the on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover at least the next 1-2 periods. While there is a risk of a stockout in the final two periods if demand stabilizes at ~120, the high 'In-transit' figure (2730 units) contains many 'lost' older orders, but recent orders from P38 (250 units) and others placed after the Fall peak began (P34 onwards) are likely still functional. Specifically, the order from P38 (250 units) should arrive imminently (L=2-3). Adding more inventory now would risk high holding costs or ending the game with excess stock.

However, placing a new order now would arrive in 2-3 periods (January), when demand for this specific lightweight product typically remains low before the Spring transition. I will follow the OR recommendation of 0 to avoid building up excess inventory at the very end of the game (total periods = 52, currently 46).
