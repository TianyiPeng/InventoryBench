Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Gyda blouse'. Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 131.4 and a standard deviation of 28.59, with a noticeable downward trend from the early January peak (162) to late January (85), followed by a bounce back (138). Given the 'Gyda blouse' is likely a staple or early spring item, and we are entering mid-February, I will use a conservative estimate derived from the late-January/February samples (recent_N=3). The promised lead time is 2, and since there is no history of arrivals yet, I'll use the default lead time. I'll set mu_hat to cover (1+L=3) periods based on the recent average demand of approx 116 units/period (mean of 126, 85, 138).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a Gyda blouse. In Period 1, we ordered 163 units based on initial data, but since the promised lead time is 2, arrivals are not expected until Period 3. Consequently, there was a stockout in Period 1 (demand 113, sold 0). The historical demand reflects a post-holiday/early spring pattern (samples: 162, 139, 126, 85, 138). The most recent demand (P1) was 113. Using N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent trend including the P1 realization. Since no shipments have concluded yet, L is set to default (promised = 2). The parameters aim to rebuild inventory to cover a 3-period cycle (L+1) while the pipeline is still filling.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for the 'Gyda blouse' has averaged ~132 units over the past 5 samples (P-5 to P0). In Period 1 and 2, demand was 113 and 144 respectively. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 320 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 2, the order from P1 (163 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 3 'conclude' message (available at the start of Period 4). We have not yet confirmed the actual lead time, so we stick to 'default' (L=2). For demand estimation, the most recent 5 samples (including the pre-game history) show a stable pattern with a mean of 132. We use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior while accounting for the current stockout situation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The SKU 695632002 (Gyda blouse) has a promised lead time (L) of 2. Looking at history: Period 1's order (163 units) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase to be visible in 'Period 3 conclude'. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely at least 3 periods, or there's a delay. I will set L=3 explicitly for this period to reflect this lag. Demand shows an upward trend (113, 144, 174). Combined with pre-period samples (162, 139, 126, 85, 138), the current mean is approximately 135. Given the rising demand and the transition into spring (March), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current velocity (avg ~150 over last 5 including pre-history), and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety buffers. Since we have 0 on-hand and 431 in-transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary gap coverage based on these updated parameters.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/03/11). Historical demand samples show a baseline around 120-140, but recent game history (Periods 1-4) shows a significant increase: 113, 144, 174, 150 (Mean ~145.25). This suggests a step-up in demand as we move into the spring season for women's blouses ('Gyda blouse'). Regarding lead time, the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), matching the promised lead time. The Period 1 order (163 units) is notably missing from the 'conclude' messages despite a promised lead time of 2. If it were lead_time=3, it should have arrived in Period 4. Its absence suggests it may be lost or significantly delayed. On-hand inventory is low (7), and the pipeline (In-transit: 451) supposedly contains orders from P1, P3, and P4. Since P1 is likely lost, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the higher volume and monitor for lead-time stability. N=4 is chosen for mu_hat to capture the 'game history' regime which is consistently higher than the pre-game samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's blouse. Historical demand (8 data points) is relatively stable: 162, 139, 126, 85, 138, 113, 144, 174, 150, 168. The mean demand is approximately 140. Looking at the lead time history: the Period 1 order (163 units) is significantly overdue (was expected in Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start). Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (LT=2). Period 3 order (111 units) was expected in Period 5 conclude/Period 6 start but 'arrived=0' is reported for Period 5. This suggests instability in fulfillment (potentially lost or delayed shipments). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 501 units (from orders in P1, P3, P4, P5). Given the recent demand mean (~140-150), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the last 5 periods) to capture the slight uptick in demand. For L, I will use 'default' (2) because while one shipment is late, the only completed arrival matched the promised LT=2. I will increase sigma_hat using 'recent_N' to account for current volatility and out-of-stock risk.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. The SKU is a 'Gyda blouse', a staple women's garment. Historical demand over the last 6 periods averages ~144 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 468 units in-transit. Looking at lead times: Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), Period 5's order arrived in Period 6 (L=1). Period 1's order (163 units), Period 3's order (111 units), and Period 4's order (177 units) have not concluded yet. Period 1 is now 6 periods old, suggesting it is highly likely lost. Period 3 is 4 periods old, also potentially lost or severely delayed. Because of these missing shipments (P1, P3, P4), the system is constantly stocking out. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the stable demand around 140-150 and use an explicit L=2 to stabilize the pipeline calculation, accounting for the erratic arrival history while assuming the promised 2-period lead time as the baseline for the backend logic.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (163 units) and Period 3 (111 units) are likely lost as they are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time without arrival; current stockouts are driven by these pipeline failures rather than demand spikes.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019/04/01). The product is a women's blouse, which typically sees steady demand transitioning into spring. Historical demand averages 144 units/period (last 7 periods), while the the seed data (Jan-Feb) averaged ~137. Demand is relatively stable. However, supply chain reliability is the primary issue. Orders from Period 1 (163 units) and Period 3 (111 units) are now 7 and 5 periods old, respectively; with a promised lead time of 2, these are confirmed lost. Only orders from P2 (arrived P4) and P5 (arrived P6) have successfully arrived, with actual lead times of 2 and 1 respectively. This suggests the lead time is varying between 1-2 periods when shipments aren't lost. Since 274 units are lost out of 666 ordered (approx 41% loss rate), the pipeline inventory of 516 is misleadingly high. Subtracting the lost units (274), the effective pipeline is only 242 (Orders from P4, P6, and P7). To compensate for the stockout and the high risk of lost shipments, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to set a target that ensures the OR backend orders enough to restore safety stock, effectively ignoring the 'phantom' lost units in the pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's blouse. Recent demand has shown a significant upward trend, increasing from an average of ~140 in earlier periods to 181 and 220 in the last two weeks, likely due to spring seasonality. Pipeline reliability is a major concern: orders from Period 1 (163) and Period 3 (111) are confirmed lost (no arrival after 6-8 periods). However, more recent orders (Period 5, 6, 7) have arrived with 1-2 period lead times, suggesting the logistics channel is functioning but prone to total loss. Current on-hand is 0. With demand spiking, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the jump to ~200+ units/period. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to default (2), as recent arrivals (P4, P6, P8) show the 1-2 period range is still the operational norm despite the early losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand increased from ~140 to ~200 (+43%) over the last 3 periods (P7-P9), coinciding with spring seasonality for women's blouses.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are entering the peak spring season for this blouse. Demand has recently averaged ~200 units (N=3: P7-P9), though P9 dipped to 142, likely impacted by the persistent stockout. The pipeline inventory (745 units) is currently heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1 (163 units) and P3 (111 units), totaling 274 'ghost' units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive. This creates a risk of significant under-ordering. To compensate for these 274 lost units and the increased spring demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at 180 units/period. Over the (L+1)=3 period window, base demand is 540 units. To offset the 274 lost units specifically, I set mu_hat to 814 (540 + 274). Lead time (L) is set to 2, as recent arrivals show a mix of 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for higher volatility during seasonal transitions and to encourage a higher safety stock to recover from current nil inventory.

While the carry-over insight noted a spike to ~200, the last two periods (P9-P10) showed a return to lower levels (142, 116), making the recent 4-period average (P7-P10) approximately 165. Lead time analysis: P2, P5, P6, P7, and P8 orders all arrived within 1-2 periods. However, P1 and P3 orders (totaling 274 units) are definitively lost. On-hand inventory is 178, and the pipeline contains 919 total units (685 in-transit + 234 ordered in P10). However, 274 of those units (P1 and P3) are permanently lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 645 units. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current spring demand level (avg ~165 per period, totaling 495 for L+1). Sigma_hat will use recent_N=4 to reflect recent variance. The OR backend will subtract the (overstated) pipeline from the base stock; since 274 units are lost but still in the system's in-transit count, the explicit mu_hat would lead to under-ordering. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, adjusting the target base stock upward to 'neutralize' the 274 lost units sitting in the system's pipeline count: (165 * 3) + 274 = 769. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the phantom inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (late April). The product is a women's blouse, which saw a demand regime shift in early April (Period 9 insight confirmed average increased to ~200). However, demand in the last two periods (P10: 116, P11: 121) has stabilized slightly lower than the P7-P9 peak, currently averaging ~159 over the last 5 weeks. The pipeline contains 721 units, but this includes Period 1 (163) and Period 3 (111) orders which are long overdue and confirmed lost in Carry-over insights. Total pipeline in-transit (721) - lost (274) = 447 active units (from P10 and P11). On-hand is 57. The target base stock must cover (L+1) periods. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, we need lead-time demand for 3 periods (~480 units). Given 447 active in-transit + 57 on-hand = 504 units, the current position is sufficient. I will set L to 'default' (2) as recent actual lead times (P8, P10) have returned to the promised 2 periods. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the elevated spring demand level (~159/week) while smoothing the recent slight dip.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand analysis: Over the last 6 periods (P7-P12), demand has averaged approximately 156 units, with considerable volatility (116 to 220). The previously observed spike in P8 (220) and high demand in P12 (157) suggests that while the 'regime shift' to 200+ was not sustained, the baseline is higher than the initial 140. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this moderate seasonal elevated demand. Inventory status: We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). Pipeline analysis: Orders from P1 (163), P3 (111), P4 (177), and P9 (0) are overdue or missing. The 'In-transit' count of 721 includes P10 (234), P11 (36), and several earlier failed shipments. The OR backend will only see 721 in pipeline. By setting L to 'calculate', the backend will likely use the promised lead time (2) as arrivals have generally matched it when they successfully arrive (P4: 2, P6: 1, P8: 2, P8: 1, P10: 2). Lead time remains relatively stable at 1-2 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Gyda blouse', experiencing spring seasonality in May. Historical demand analysis shows two regimes: an early phase (P1-P8) averaging ~148, and a recent period (P9-P13) averaging ~135, though significantly constrained by stockouts. Total demand samples are: 113, 114, 174, 150, 168, 118, 181, 220, 142, 116, 121, 157, 138. The average demand across all periods is approximately 145. Lead times have been volatile but mostly 2 periods (P4:2, P6:1, P8:2 & 1, P10:2, P13:2). Shipments from Periods 1 (163) and 3 (111) are confirmed lost as they are >10 periods late. The current 'In-transit' of 685 includes these lost units plus the Period 4 (177) and Period 10 (234) orders which are also likely lost or severely delayed (P4 order is 10 periods late). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current spring average (~135) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average 2-period lead time. This will prompt the backend to order units to recover from the stockout caused by historical pipeline failures.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of orders from P1 (163 units), P3 (111 units), and P4 (177 units) as they have not arrived within 10+ periods. Pipeline inventory is currently inflated by these defunct 'in-transit' units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the 'Gyda blouse' is experiencing high late-spring demand (avg ~150-170 units). We have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'in-transit' figure of 685 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, orders from P1 (163), P3 (111), and P4 (177) are confirmed lost, totaling 451 phantom units that will never arrive. The P10 order of 234 units should have arrived by P13, but since it hasn't appeared in any 'conclude' message, it is also likely lost. Correcting for these losses, the actual valid pipeline is 0. To trigger a recovery order from the OR backend, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Since the backend calculates 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)', and it incorrectly thinks pipeline is 685, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this phantom inventory and the cap. Based on recent demand (recent_5 avg ~139) and L=2, a normal mu_hat would be ~417. To force an order despite the 685 'in-transit' units, I've set mu_hat to 1200. This ensures the base_stock calculation exceeds the phantom pipeline, signaling the system to restock for the current seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 10 (234 units) is now confirmed lost as it is 5 periods past its order date with no arrival. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 685 (P1, P3, P4, P10). Actual functional pipeline is 0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (Late May), demand for this women's blouse remains strong, with a recent 5-period average of approximately 157 units (P11-P15). I am currently at zero on-hand inventory due to multiple lost shipments. The backend's 'In-transit' calculation of 1,123 units includes 685 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 which have been confirmed lost according to the Carry-over Insights (they are well past the promised 2-period lead time). This leaves only the Period 15 order (438 units) as a viable incoming shipment. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1,123 'pipeline' from the base stock calculation, it will severely under-order or not order at all unless I intervene. To override this, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to effectively bypass the pipeline inflation. Target base stock = (1+L) * Forecast * Safety Factor. Forecast is ~160. L=2. Target Base Stock = (1+2)*160*1.2 \u2248 576. However, to force an order through despite the phantom 1,123 units in transit, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when minus the pipeline, still triggers a sufficient order. Since the cap also limits the order size, I will set mu_hat to 1300 to ensure the backend sees a need for more stock while the cap restricts it to a reasonable level to avoid over-ordering if things normalize.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Persistent stockouts confirmed due to cumulative loss of 685 units in pipeline. Active functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 15 onwards.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we face continued stockouts with an on-hand inventory of 0. The primary challenge is a severely inflated 'In-transit' figure of 1,373 units, as we have identified that 685 units from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 are likely lost. Consequently, the functional pipeline is only 688 units (orders from P15 and P16). The OR backend's capped policy will subtract the full 1,373 units from the target base stock, likely preventing any new orders unless we significantly inflate the 'explicit' mu_hat to account for this deficit. While demand has been somewhat volatile (P15: 185, P16: 117), the trailing 3-period average is approximately 157. However, to bypass the OR engine's 'inventory-rich' perception caused by lost shipments, I will use an explicit mu_hat that represents the demand for (L+1) periods plus the 685 lost units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 157) + 685 = 1156. This ensures the backend emits a necessary replenishment order despite the phantom inventory in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 (P12-P16) to capture the current demand volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, a total of 688 units arrived (438 from P15 and 250 from P16), ending the prolonged stockout. Current on-hand inventory is 588 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 685 remains inflated by historically lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10), which I have confirmed as defunct in previous carry-over insights. The actual functional pipeline is now 0. Demand has cooled slightly since the spring peak (P17 demand was 100), but remains somewhat volatile. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (~140-150 range) while ignoring the extreme stockout-influenced periods. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 685 phantom 'in-transit' units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired target stock PLUS the phantom units. Target stock (L+1=3 periods) at ~150/period is ~450. Adding 685 units gives 1135. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) calculates a positive order to maintain safety stock as the current 588 on-hand units deplete.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Stockout period ended with 688 units arriving. Confirmed functional pipeline is 0; the 685 units shown in-transit are confirmed lost. Recent demand (P17) suggests a cooling from the spring peak to approximately 100-140 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June). Historical data shows a cooling trend for the Gyda blouse. Demand in early Spring (April/May) peaked around 170-200 units, but the most recent periods (P17, P18) show a significant drop to 100 and 87 units respectively, suggesting the peak season for this specific soft-weave blouse is ending. The In-transit count of 685 is composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10), meaning the functional pipeline is 0. With 501 units currently on-hand and an estimated demand of ~100 per period, we have approximately 5 periods of stock. My goal is to prevent further ordering while we burn through this excess inventory, especially since the OR backend uses the inflated in-transit figure (685) in its pipeline calculation which will naturally suppress new orders. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P16-P18) to capture the cooling demand profile (avg ~101), providing a realistic anchor for any eventual replenishment needs while avoiding stockouts during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P17-P18 demand (100, 87) is significantly lower than the P14-P15 peak (~175). Demand regime has shifted from ~180 to ~100 units per week (-44%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June). Demand for the Gyda blouse has significantly cooled from its spring peak (which reached ~185 units). The last three periods recorded demand of 100, 87, and 79 units respectively, confirming a new lower-demand regime averaging approx. 89 units per week. The system shows 685 units 'in-transit', but carry-over insights and historical evidence confirm these are lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P10. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 422 units. With demand averaging ~89 units, 422 units cover approximately 4.7 weeks of demand, which is well above the (L+1=3) weeks required to maintain service levels. To avoid further holding costs on a declining seasonal item, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect the current cooling trend (~89 * 3 = 267) and use default settings for lead time and sigma. The OR backend's inventory calculation (inclusive of the defunct 685 units) will likely result in a zero order, which is the desired outcome.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend continues: P17-P19 demand has dropped to an average of 89 units per week, down from the P14-P15 peak of ~175.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in a clear post-peak cooling phase for the Gyda blouse. Demand since Period 17 has been steadily declining (100, 87, 79, 49), bringing the 4-week average to 78.75 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 685 remains comprised entirely of confirmed lost units (from P1, P3, P4, and P10). Because these units are defunct, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) would be artificially suppressed if it viewed '685' as real inventory. With on-hand inventory at 373 units, we have roughly 4.7 periods of supply relative to current demand. Given the downward trend and the surplus inventory, no replacement orders are needed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the summer cooling trend, and 'default' for other parameters. This will allow the on-hand stock to be naturally liquidated.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend exacerbated: average demand P17-P20 dropped to 79 units/week (-55% from peak). Current on-hand (373) represents high weeks-of-supply given summer slowdown.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-08, which is mid-summer for the Gyda blouse. Demand has significantly cooled as confirmed in previous periods, with recent demand (P17-P21) being 100, 87, 79, 49, and 64 units. The average for the last 5 periods (N=5) is 75.8 units/week, down from the spring peak (~175). Current on-hand inventory is 309 units. Excluding the 685 lost units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10), the functional pipeline is 0. Based on the target service level (Profit 19 vs Holding 1), we want to hold significant stock, but current on-hand already covers over 4 weeks of demand (309 / 75.8 = 4.07 periods), which is well above the (L+1=3) coverage required for the base-stock policy. I will use the recent 5-period average for mu_hat (N=5) and sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the summer slowdown. Lead time L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P21) average is ~76 units/week, a significant sustained drop from the spring peak of ~180 units/week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, which is mid-summer. Demand for the Gyda blouse has significantly cooled from its spring peak (~180 units/week) to a sustained low-demand regime. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 72.3 units/week (100, 87, 79, 49, 64, 55). The 'In-transit' figure of 685 units consists entirely of orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 that are confirmed lost (as noted in carry-over insights). Therefore, the 'functional pipeline' is 0. With 254 units on-hand and an average demand of ~72 units/week, we have approximately 3.5 weeks of supply. Given the lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3), our current inventory already exceeds the required base stock for this low-demand regime. No new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent 6-period average to ensure the OR backend aligns with this lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P22) average is ~72 units/week, down from spring peak of ~180 units/week.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The 'Gyda blouse' is experiencing a sustained mid-summer demand slowdown. Demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) has averaged approximately 73 units per week (100, 87, 79, 49, 64, 55, 78), which is a significant drop from the spring peak of ~180. The 685 units currently 'in-transit' are confirmed lost (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10), meaning the functional pipeline is 0. With 176 units on-hand, we have over 2 weeks of supply at the current consumption rate. The OR backend needs to be aware of the lower demand regime to avoid over-ordering as stock levels naturally deplete. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this summer regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains consistently around the promised 2 periods (ignoring the lost shipments which do not conclude).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P23) average is confirmed at ~73 units/week, down from spring peak of ~180 units/week (-59%).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is late summer. Demand has significantly cooled from the spring peak (~180 units/week) to a much lower mid-summer regime. Over the last 8 periods (P17-P24), demand has averaged approximately 69.8 units/week (100, 87, 79, 49, 64, 55, 78, 47). The most recent period (P24) showed a demand of 47 units. The on-hand inventory is 129 units, which covers nearly 2 weeks of the current average demand. The 685 units shown as 'in-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10) and should be ignored for actual supply planning. However, because the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from the base_stock calculation, and the on-hand inventory (129) is already sufficient for at least 1.8 weeks of supply at current rates, no new order is required this period. To prevent the OR backend from triggering an unnecessary order while in-transit units are miscounted, I will set mu_hat conservatively using the recent low-demand regime (N=8) and allow the high 'in-transit' value to keep the order quantity at zero.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P24) average finalized at ~70 units/week, a 61% reduction from spring peak.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5). Following a significant spring peak (reaching ~180 units/week), the product (Gyda blouse) has settled into a mid-summer demand regime. For the last 9 periods (P17-P25), demand has averaged 68.5 units per week, with a notable cooling trend maintained. On-hand inventory is 71 units, while the in-transit figure (685) remains entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 \u2013 this means the actual functional pipeline is zero. Since on-hand inventory (71) is now very close to the single-period expected demand in this low regime (~68), and the OR backend uses only promised lead time (L=2) to calculate the pipeline need (total coverage for L+1=3 periods), we must request stock today. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering P17-P25) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring we don't over-order based on the high spring historical data, while acknowledging the need to replenish as our on-hand safety buffer is nearly depleted.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (P17-P25) average finalized at ~69 units/week, representing a consistent low-demand state compared to the spring peak.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is now in a stockout situation as of the end of Period 26, after exhausting the last of the large bulk arrival from P17. The current date is August 12 (Period 27), marking the end of the mid-summer low-demand period and the potential beginning of late-summer/pre-autumn interest. The carry-over insights establish a mid-summer demand regime (P17-P25) averaging ~69 units/week. However, Period 26 saw a jump to 127 units, suggesting a potential shift or volatility as we exit the peak summer weeks. I will use the last 10 samples (P17-P26) to calculate mu_hat, which encompasses the low summer floor while reflecting the recent spike (average ~75 units/week). L is set to default as recent arrivals (P15, P16, P11) have followed the 1-2 period lead time pattern, despite the historical 'lost' units (685) still polluting the pipeline inventory. The OR backend will order to cover (L+1) demand, accounting for the 0 on-hand inventory, while effectively ignoring the 685 defunct pipeline units due to the capped policy and the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential exit from mid-summer demand floor (P17-P25 avg: 69) as P26 demand spiked to 127 (+84% vs floor).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Re-evaluating the inventory position, the 685 units listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (Period 1, 3, 4, and 10 orders), meaning the functional pipeline is actually zero. Demand analysis shows a significant shift: from Period 17 to 25, the demand hit a mid-summer floor averaging ~69 units/week. However, the last two periods (P26-P27) saw a spike to 127 and 116 units respectively (avg: 121), signaling an exit from the summer slump as the market moves toward late August (back-to-school/seasonal transition). I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this new regime using an explicit value of 360 units for the (L+1)=3 period window (120 units/week * 3). L is set to 'default' (2 periods) as recent successful arrivals (P15, P16) adhered to the 1-2 period lead time. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this transition phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: summer floor (avg 69) ended at Period 26; current demand has risen to ~120 units/week (+74%) as of late August.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Gyda blouse has transitioned from its mid-summer floor (avg ~69) into a higher late-summer/pre-autumn regime. Demand in Period 26 and 27 spiked to 127 and 116 respectively, though Period 28 saw a dip to 76. The average demand since Period 26 is approximately 106 units/week. Currently, the system shows 685 units 'in-transit', but these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to calculate the order, and the 'on-hand' is 0, the backend will believe we are overstocked and place no orders unless the mu_hat is set extremely high. To counteract the 685 'ghost' units in the pipeline and trigger an order to meet the new demand regime (approx 106 units/week), I am using an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Expected safety stock level for 106 units/week at L=2 (3 periods) with 19:1 critical ratio is roughly 450-500 units. Adding the 685 ghost units to this target gives an explicit mu_hat of ~1150 units. This forces the OR backend to place an order of ~465 units (1150 - 685), which aligns with roughly 4 weeks of supply for the current demand regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. Historical analysis confirms a 'lost' pipeline total of 685 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10) that will likely never arrive, distorting the 'in-transit' count of 1113. The functional pipeline is only the order from Period 29 (428 units). Demand has recently exited the summer low-point (avg ~69) and entered a higher late-summer/early-autumn regime. Over the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has averaged 101.25 units/week (127, 116, 76, 86). Using N=4 for mu_hat captures this recent recovery while discounting the summer floor. For lead time, while many orders were lost, successful arrivals (P4, P6, P8, P10, P13, P17) demonstrate that when shipments do arrive, lead time is typically 1-2 periods. I will use the default promised lead time of 2. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. We are in a post-summer demand regime for the Gyda blouse. Demand since Period 26 has averaged approximately 103 units/week (127, 116, 76, 86, 108), which is a significant increase from the summer floor of ~69 units/week, though lower than the spring peak of ~180. The functional pipeline is very low: the 'In-transit' figure of 1113 is composed of 685 units confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10) and an order of 428 units from Period 29. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in stockouts. The order from Period 29 is expected to arrive during Period 31 (lead time 2), which would be visible in the Period 32 start. To recover and maintain availability for this new demand level (~100 units/week) while accounting for the lost units inflating the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to reflect the post-summer average (~100 * (1+L)) using a recent_N of 5. L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand recovery confirmed: Average demand from Period 26-30 is ~103 units/week, up from the summer floor of 69 units/week (+49%).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019). The carry-over insights correctly identify a post-summer recovery in demand for the 'Gyda blouse', averaging approximately 103 units/week since Period 26 (Sept-Oct inventory preparation). However, we are currently facing a total stockout with 0 units on-hand as of the end of Period 31. The 'In-transit' figure of 1113 units is highly misleading: it includes 685 units confirmed lost across Periods 1-10. Additionally, the order from Period 29 (428 units) is now at its promised L=2 lead time but hasn't arrived in the Period 31 conclude message (it is scheduled to arrive during Period 31's arrival phase and become visible in Period 32's conclude). Given the significant demand of 154 units in Period 31 and the zero on-hand balance, we must ensure the backend orders enough to bridge the gap if the P29 shipment also fails. I will set mu_hat based on the recent N=6 recovery regime (avg ~111) and use explicit L=2 to stabilize the base stock calculation, while keeping sigma_hat high enough to account for the recent demand volatility (76 to 154).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery stabilized: Average demand from Period 26-31 (late August to mid-September) is 111 units/week, a 60% increase from the summer floor of 69.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23 (late September). Demand has stabilized in a post-summer recovery phase. Average demand from Period 26-32 is approximately 117 units/week (127, 116, 76, 86, 108, 154, 153), confirming the recovery from the summer floor of 69 units/week. Inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory of 1113 units is heavily distorted by 685 units confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10). The functional pipeline consists of the Period 29 order (428 units), which is now 1 period past the promised lead time of 2 (ordered P29, expected P31, now START of P33 decision). Given the history of lost and delayed shipments, I must assume a higher actual lead time to force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated total in-transit count. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the post-summer recovery (Period 26-32: avg ~117, so mu_hat = 3 * 117 = 351). I will set L to 3 periods to account for the current delay of the P29 order and the overall unreliability of the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer recovery stabilized: Average demand from Period 26-32 (mid-August to mid-September) is 117 units/week, up from the summer floor of 69 (+70%). Supply chain remains unreliable with the Period 29 order (428 units) now overdue (3 periods since order).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand recovery/autumn phase for the Gyda blouse. Demand spiked significantly in Period 33 to 290 units, pushing the post-summer average (P26-P33) to 139 units/week. However, we are facing a critical supply chain failure: the order from Period 29 (428 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, despite a 2-period promised lead time. Following the pattern established in early periods where several orders were lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10), I am categorizing the 428 units from P29 as likely lost. This leaves us with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'active' functional pipeline of 0, as the 1113 units 'in-transit' consist entirely of lost shipments (P1: 163, P3: 111, P4: 177, P10: 234, P29: 428). To trigger a recovery order from the OR backend, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will forecast demand at 150 units/week (reflecting the recent upward trend) and assume the promised lead time of 2, resulting in a mu_hat of 450. Since the backend subtracts 'in-transit' units from the base stock, and the backend sees 1113 units in transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this 'ghost' inventory. However, the backend cap (approx 1.5x mu_hat) will limit the order size. By setting mu_hat to 450 and using a high sigma_hat, I aim to signal the need for a maximum possible restock to end the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Supply chain failure confirmed for second time. Order from Period 29 (428 units) is 3 periods overdue and likely lost. Total defunct units in 'in-transit' view is now 1113. Significant demand surge detected in late September (P33: 290 units), suggesting autumn seasonality is stronger than the spring peak.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand autumn phase (Period 33-34 avg: 241) and experiencing a critical stockout. The order from Period 29 (428 units) is now 5 periods old and is confirmed lost, as the promised lead time is 2 and the latest arrive-by date for a reliable shipment would have been Period 32. This adds to the previous 685 lost units, totaling 1113 defunct units in the 'in-transit' count. On-hand inventory is 0. Since the functional pipeline is effectively zero, the OR backend must be triggered to place a large recovery order. I will use 'explicit' for L to maintain the promised 2-period baseline while signaling the backend to ignore the defunct pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 660 (220 units/week * (1+2)) to reflect the current autumn demand increase (recent demand: 290, 192), ensuring the order is large enough to cover the stockout and lead time. sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high volatility seen in recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed loss of Period 29 order (428 units). Total defunct pipeline inventory is now 1113 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). Functional pipeline is 0. Autumn demand surge confirmed with Period 33-34 average at 241 units/week.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14 (mid-October). The 'Gyda blouse' is entering its peak autumn demand season. Recent demand from P33-P35 (290, 192, 177) indicates a significant surge compared to the summer floor (avg 69) and post-summer recovery (avg 111). The average demand over the last three periods (N=3) is 220 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains a critical issue; 1113 units in the 'in-transit' category are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P29). Functional pipeline inventory and on-hand inventory are both currently 0. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the high autumn demand regime (220 * (1+L) = 660) and explicit sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility seen in the sudden jump to 290. Using L=2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P17) followed this lead time, despite the intermittent total losses of other batches.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P33-P35 average demand is 220 units/week (+100% vs post-summer recovery avg of 111). Second major supply chain failure confirmed: Period 29 order (428 units) is lost, bringing total defunct pipeline inventory to 1113 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a critical stockout situation at Period 37 (October 21) following a significant autumn demand surge (avg ~200 units/week). The 'in-transit' inventory of 1113 units is entirely defunct (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now definitively P29), meaning the functional pipeline is 0 and on-hand inventory is 0. With the promised lead time of 2 periods, we need an order that covers demand for (L+1) = 3 periods to restore stock. Demand peaked at 290 in P33 and has since settled to 145 in P36; the recent average for this autumn regime (P33-P36) is approximately 201 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 620 to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 200 * 3) plus a small buffer, and use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (std of {290, 192, 177, 145} is ~62, so sqrt(3)*62 \u2248 107). To ignore the defunct 1113 units in the OR backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I will adjust mu_hat by adding those 1113 units to the target, ensuring the OR engine places a large enough order to overcome the 'ghost' inventory. Thus, mu_hat = 620 + 1113 = 1733.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Autumn demand surge (P33-P36) average is 201 units/week. Supply chain remains unreliable; functional pipeline is 0 as the 1113 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29) are confirmed lost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late October (P38). Significant autumn demand surge confirmed starting around Period 33, with demand averaging approximately 201 units/week over the last 5 periods (P33-P37). However, the supply chain remains a major issue: 1113 units in the 'In-transit' view (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P29) are confirmed lost. The only functional order in the pipeline is from P37 (683 units). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is high, we must maintain a high base stock. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the autumn demand level (avg ~201). I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P17) followed this, though I will closely monitor the P37 order for arrival. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed (P33-P37): Average demand is ~201 units/week, doubling the post-summer recovery rate. Pipeline remains heavily polluted with 1113 lost units; functional inventory management must ignore these records.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 39 (early November). Recent demand (P33-P38) averaged 194.5 units per week, confirming the autumn peak previously identified. The shipment from Period 37 (683 units) arrived in Period 38 with a lead time of 1 period, providing 520 units on-hand. All 1113 units currently 'in-transit' (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P29) are confirmed lost and must be ignored. Functional pipeline is currently 0. To ensure coverage through the remainder of the autumn/pre-holiday season, mu_hat is set to roughly 200 units/week for 3 periods (L+1). I'm using N=6 for demand (P33-P38) to capture the current regime and sigma_hat is set explicitly to 50 to account for recent demand volatility (high of 290, low of 145). Choosing recent_N for L (N=3) reflects the fact that recent arrivals (P37 and earlier) have shown 1-2 period lead times, though P29 was lost.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed (P33-P38): Average demand is approximately 195 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains a concern, but the successful arrival of P37 order demonstrates that the system is not permanently blocked.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40 (mid-November). The Autumn demand surge (starting P33) has slightly moderated from its peak (~220 units) to an average of approximately 185 units/week over the last 7 periods (P33-P39). The successful arrival of the Period 37 order in Period 38 (1-period lead time) confirms the functional supply chain is operational, though the 1113 units in-transit from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 29 remain confirmed lost and must be ignored in pipeline calculations. With 385 units on hand and 0 functional units in transit, we are currently covered for approximately 2 periods of demand (385 / 185 = 2.08). Given a promised lead time of 2, we must ensure we maintain sufficient stock for the (L+1) window. I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods to capture the current Autumn regime and explicit lead time at 2 to be conservative despite the recent fast arrival.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak (P33-P39) stabilized at an average of ~185 units/week. Functional lead time recently observed at 1 period (P37 order), but overall supply chain remains high-risk with 1113 units confirmed lost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. We are in the autumn/early winter demand regime. Over the last 8 periods (P33-P40), the average demand has been approximately 183 units per week (ranging from 135 to 290). This represents a significant sustained level compared to the summer floor. The functional pipeline is currently empty, as the 1113 units 'in-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). On-hand inventory is 219 units. With an average demand of ~183, the current stock will likely only last approximately one more period (P41). Lead times have been inconsistent, with the most recent successful arrival (P37 order) taking 1 period, while the one before (P16) took 1 period and many others were lost. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture the current autumn demand levels and set L to 2 to maintain a conservative safety buffer given the high history of lost shipments and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P33-P40) average stabilized at ~183 units/week. Supply chain remains high-risk with a cumulative total of 1113 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29) confirmed lost, making the 'In-transit' figure highly misleading for order calculations.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the end of the game (Period 42 of 47). The Autumn/Winter demand regime (P33-P41) has stabilized at an average of 182 units/week. On-hand inventory is critically low at 55 units, and demand has consistently exceeded this level in recent weeks. The 'In-transit' figure of 1113 is composed entirely of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29) as documented in the Carry-over Insights; thus, the functional pipeline is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 periods and a recent actual lead time of 1 period (P37 order), I must set parameters to trigger a significant restock immediately to avoid stockouts in the final weeks. I will use the last 9 periods (P33-P41) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the promised Lead Time of 2 to be conservative given past supply chain instability.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand regime (P33-P41) confirmed at an average of 182 units/week. Functional pipeline remains 0 despite 1113 units shown as in-transit, as all units in that figure are from orders confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), we observed a massive demand spike to 862 units, far exceeding the previous autumn average of ~183. This aligns with Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak demand for retail. The current on-hand inventory is 0. While the system shows 1113 units 'In-transit', these are confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 29) as documented in carry-over insights. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must set the lead time significantly higher (explicit L=8) to increase the base stock level, or use an explicit mu_hat that reflects the holiday surge. Given the recent spike, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for a predicted average of ~350 units over the next 3 weeks (balancing the 862 peak with potential post-peak cooling) and use L=2 (promised). Sigma_hat is increased to reflect high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand surge confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 862 units (v.s. previous avg of 182), indicating massive Black Friday impact. Total defunct pipeline remains 1113 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 follows the massive Black Friday demand spike (Period 42: 862 units). Current demand has moderated to 227 units (Period 43), but remains significantly higher than the pre-holiday autumn average (~183), likely due to ongoing holiday shopping and Cyber Monday. Total 'In-transit' is 1708 units, but 1113 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). A 595-unit order was placed in P43, which serves as our only functional pipeline inventory. On-hand is 0. With only 4 periods remaining in the sim, the inventory must be aggressively restocked to cover the holiday tail. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the elevated autumn/winter baseline (including the P42 spike) and sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility observed during the holiday window. Lead time L is set to calculate to reflect the recent variability (ranging from 1 to 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Holiday season volatility confirmed: Black Friday (P42) demand was 4.7x the autumn baseline. Post-spike demand (P43: 227) remains 24% higher than pre-holiday levels.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday period (P45), following a massive Black Friday spike (P42 demand: 862). The subsequent demand in P43-P44 has settled to an average of 179 units, which is consistent with the pre-holiday autumn baseline (~183), though P44 (131) suggests a cooling trend. Supply chain reliability remains very poor; 1113 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). In-transit shows 1708 units, but after subtracting the 1113 lost units (P1: 163, P3: 111, P4: 177, P10: 234, P29: 428), the functional pipeline is lead by the P43 order of 595 units. We are currently out of stock. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is avoiding stockouts during the remainder of the holiday season. I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 540 based on a 3-period lead-time coverage (L=2 + 1 for current period) at a conservative rate of 180 units/period, despite the P44 dip. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to account for recent extreme volatility. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate recent actual arrivals into the OR logic while I manually account for the lost shipments in the mu_hat buffer.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season transition: Black Friday (P42) demand was 862 units. Post-holiday baseline (P43-P44) has reverted to approximately 179 units per week. Functional pipeline consists only of the P43 order (595 units); the remaining 1113 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The massive Black Friday demand spike (862 units) in Period 42 has passed. Demand for the last three periods (P43-P45) has averaged 172 units/week (227, 131, 157), which is remarkably consistent with the pre-holiday autumn baseline (~183 units). We are currently in the week of Christmas; while some categories spike, 'Womens Tailoring' often cools down immediately following the holiday peak. I am projecting a mean demand of 170 units/week for the immediate post-holiday period. On-hand inventory is 438 units. 'In-transit' shows 1113 units, but these are all confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29) and must be excluded from the base stock calculation. The functional pipeline is 0. With L=2, the required inventory to cover (L+1)=3 periods is approximately 510 units (3 * 170). Since on-hand (438) is close to this requirement and the system is prone to supply chain losses, I will use a slightly more conservative recent window (N=3) to set mu_hat, reflecting the post-Black Friday stabilization, and maintain standard volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (P43-P45) has stabilized at ~172 units/week, reverting to the pre-Black Friday autumn baseline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019. We are in the post-holiday period. Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization after the Black Friday spike (Period 42), with demand for the last few periods (P43-P46) averaging ~150 units/week (227, 131, 157, 83). The final sample of 83 suggests a further drop, likely due to the end-of-year holiday week. The 'In-transit' figure of 1113 units consists entirely of orders confirmed lost in previous insights (P1, P3, P4, P10, P29). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0. On-hand inventory is 355 units. Given an estimated demand mean of ~150 and a 2-period lead time, we have roughly 2+ weeks of supply on hand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the post-holiday baseline while excluding the Black Friday outlier. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead times (typically 1-2 periods when they actually arrive).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (P43-P46) has stabilized at an average of 150 units/week, down from the Autumn peak (~185) and significantly lower than the Black Friday spike.
