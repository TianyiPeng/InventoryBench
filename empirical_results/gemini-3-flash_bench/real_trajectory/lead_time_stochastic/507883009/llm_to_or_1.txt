Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for SKU 507883009 (Womens Lingerie) shows samples: 124, 168, 190, 183, 99. The most recent sample (99) follows a higher plateau (~180s), possibly indicating a post-January dip. Mean demand is approximately 152.8. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, where the target service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.5. At q=0.5, z=0, so the base stock level targets the mean demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods). Since this is the first period with no in-transit or on-hand inventory, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent mean across the provided history, and default settings for L and sigma_hat to establish a baseline. I am targeting (1+L) * mean \u2248 3 * 152.8 \u2248 458 units of coverage.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Ellen Thong (Malva) L 3pk'. Promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 218 units, but since lead time is >= 1, they have not arrived yet. Current on-hand is 0, and we had 112 units of lost sales in Period 1 due to zero starting inventory. Historical demand samples (124, 168, 190, 183, 99) plus Period 1 demand (112) show a mean of ~146. Demand seems to be softening in February compared to late January. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent trend (99, 112, 183) which averages ~131. With L=2, the backend will target (1+2)*131 = 393 units for the base stock. Given 218 are already in-transit, the OR engine will order approximately 175 more units to cover the pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is women's underwear. Historical demand shows an average of ~153 units per week (min 99, max 190). In Period 1, we ordered 218 units, and in Period 2, we ordered 176 units. Total in-transit is 394 units. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Therefore, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion report. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet, and we have missed sales in Periods 1 and 2. Demand in the last two periods (112, 169) is consistent with the historical range. Since there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or a structural demand shift, I will use recent historical data (N=5 including the last two periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the default promised lead-time of 2 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is Ellen Thong underwear. The historical demand for the last five weeks (unobserved in-game but provided in context) was 124, 168, 190, 183, and 99. In-game demand for Periods 1-3 was 112, 169, and 136. There is currently 0 on-hand inventory and 452 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the timing rule, the order placed in P1 (218 units) should arrive during P3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). However, the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential lead time delay or a lost shipment, though it's too early to confirm a lost shipment. Since on-hand is 0 and we have missed the first expected arrival, the priority is to re-establish inventory. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (averaging late historical and early game data) to stabilize the forecast against the recent 99-169 range.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). Item 507883009 is a 3-pack of women's underwear. History shows demand for the last five weeks: 124, 168, 190, 183, 99 (pre-game) and 112, 169, 136, 123 (periods 1-4). The mean demand is approximately 144.8 units/period. Lead time: Promised is 2. The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2). The order from Period 1 (218 units) has not yet concluded in a 'conclude' message, which is expected as it should arrive in Period 3 conclude (delayed) or Period 4 conclude (not seen). However, Period 4 conclude shows an arrival from Period 2, suggesting Period 1 might be lost or significantly delayed. But since Period 1 order was 218 and current 'In-transit' is 384 (P1: 218 + P3: 58 + P4: 108 = 384), the P1 order is still tracked as In-transit. Our current on-hand is 53. Since demand has been stable (~145), and L=2, mu_hat should target (1+2)*145 = 435. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand which is slightly lower than early peaks.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. The product is Women's Lingerie (3-pack underwear). Demand over the past 5 weeks (and 5 pre-game samples) has fluctuated between 83 and 190. Average demand is approx 143. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). However, the P1 order (218 units) has not concluded by Period 5 (it should have arrived in Period 3). This suggests the P1 order is likely lost. The P3 order (58 units) should have arrived in P5 but didn't, and the P4 order (108 units) is expected in P6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With total in-transit at 384 (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108), if we assume P1 is lost, effective pipeline is only 166. Recent demand is lower (83, 123), so I will use a recent N=5 (P1-P5) for mu_hat to capture the current trend. I'll maintain L=2 as it was validated by the P2 arrival.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Reviewing the history for SKU 507883009: On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 384 units. This pipeline comprises the order from Period 1 (218 units), Period 3 (58 units), and Period 4 (108 units). The Period 2 order (176 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time 2). However, the Period 1 order (placed Feb 11) is now 4 periods overdue relative to its promised lead time of 2, and the Period 3 order is also past due. This suggests potential shipment loss or significant lead-time instability. Demand samples (124, 168, 190, 183, 99 from pre-game; 112, 169, 136, 123, 83, 135 from game history) show a mean of approximately 139. With L=2, the total pipeline requirement is roughly 139 * 3 = 417 units. Since we have 384 in-transit (even if some are suspect) and 0 on-hand, the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the in-game demand average (approx 126) and 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the delivery delays without over-inflating base stock too aggressively until the loss is certain.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 3-pack of women's underwear (staple item). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 384 units in-transit. Looking at the history: Period 1 order (218 units) is severely overdue (7 periods since order, promised 2); it is likely lost. Period 2 order (176 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). Period 3 order (58 units) and Period 4 order (108 units) are currently overdue (5 and 4 periods since order respectively). This indicates a high risk of lost shipments or significant lead-time instability. Demand remains relatively stable between 80-190 units (historical mean ~145). Since 384 units are in-transit (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108), and the OR backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline) will see 384 units as 'available', it will not place new orders if P1 is indeed lost. To force the system to reconcile, I will use an 'explicit' lead time L=4 to reflect the current delays and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture recent volatility. The Profit-to-Holding ratio is 1:1, meaning the optimal service level is 50%, favoring lower holding costs, but we must first restore stock.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply chain disruption: Order from Period 1 (218 units) appears lost (7 periods elapsed). Orders from P3 and P4 are also overdue, suggesting a shift in actual lead time from 2 to at least 4-5 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observed that order P1 (218 units) has likely been lost given 7 periods have elapsed since placement, well beyond the promised lead time of 2. Furthermore, orders from P3 (58 units) and P4 (108 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively, and have not yet arrived. Our only successful delivery was P2 on P4 (lead time = 2). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 554 units in-transit (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108, P8: 170). Since P1 is likely lost, those 218 units are 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend might rely on incorrectly. To force a re-order and account for the supply instability, I am setting L to 4 (reflecting the current delay) and using the recent mean of the last 4 periods (approx 107 units/period) to set mu_hat. By setting L=4, mu_hat = (1+4)*107 = 535. Given the high pipeline/in-transit count (which includes the lost P1), the OR engine might still order less than ideal, but this is the most aggressive correction possible to mitigate the stockout while acknowledging the lost units and extended lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The supply chain situation remains critical. The shipment from Period 1 (218 units) is officially 9 periods old and must be considered lost. Shipments from Period 3 (58 units) and Period 4 (108 units) are also significantly overdue (7 and 6 periods elapsed respectively). Only the Period 2 order arrived successfully on schedule (L=2). This indicates either a massive lead time expansion or, more likely, a series of lost shipments. With 0 on-hand inventory and 554 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P8), but no arrivals since Period 4, we must adjust the OR parameters to ignore the 'lost' units in the pipeline. Since the backend subtracts 'in-transit' from 'base_stock', if we believe the pipeline contains ghost units, we must inflate the mu_hat to force new orders. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 111.4 units over the last 9 periods. I will set L to 4 (explicit) to reflect the observed delays and use an explicit mu_hat to override the pipeline deficit caused by lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 1 shipment (218 units) is lost. Period 3 and 4 shipments are highly likely lost or delayed beyond 6 periods. Pipeline inventory is currently unreliable for OR calculations.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), the supply chain remains highly unstable. We have confirmed the loss of the Period 1 order (218 units). Most importantly, orders from Period 3 (58 units) and Period 4 (108 units) are now 8 and 7 periods old respectively, and since the Period 8 order (170 units) arrived exactly on time (2 periods), these older orders are almost certainly lost. This creates a highly inaccurate pipeline inventory of 580 units (218 + 58 + 108 + 196), where 384 units are 'ghost' units that will never arrive. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see this inflated pipeline and fail to order. To force an order and maintain stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for L to simulate a much longer coverage period and 'explicit' mu_hat to create a target stock level that overcomes the 384 units of lost inventory. Since demand has softened recently (avg ~75 over last 3 periods), I'm targeting a base stock of approx 600 units (intended 200 physical + 400 to offset losses).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic loss of shipments from Period 1, 3, and 4 (Total 384 units). Period 8 shipment arrived with standard lead time (2 periods), suggesting recent logistics are healthy, but legacy pipeline data is corrupted by lost orders.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand inventory is 15. The 'In-transit' figure of 580 is significantly inflated due to lost shipments from Periods 1 (218), 3 (58), and 4 (108), totaling 384 units. These missing units deceive the OR backend into under-ordering because it believes they are eventually arriving. Real actual in-transit inventory is 580 - 384 = 196 units (from the Period 10 order). Recent demand (since P5) has stabilized around a lower mean of 91 units compared to the early-year spikes. The lead time for the P8 order (observed arriving in P10) was 2 periods, confirming that recent shipments are arriving on schedule. To correct the backend's behavior, I will use 'explicit' values for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*forecasted_demand = (1+2)*91 = 273. Sigma is set using the standard deviation of the last 7 periods (from P5 onwards), which is approx 27.6, yielding (1+2)^0.5 * 27.6 \u2248 48. These parameters allow the backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current demand regime and the 2-period lead time, although the user should be aware the 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction in the backend still uses the inflated 580 value.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU 507883009 (Lingerie/Underwear) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). History confirms that shipments from Period 1 (218 units), Period 3 (58 units), and Period 4 (108 units) are lost, totaling 384 units that reside in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - pipeline), so these phantom units prevent the system from ordering enough to meet demand. Pipeline inventory currently shows 580 units, but 384 are lost, meaning actual effective pipeline is only 196 units (from the order in Period 10). To fix this, I must boost mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Theoretical demand mean (Period 1-12) is ~110. With L=2, the OR engine expects to cover 3 periods (~330 units). By setting mu_hat explicitly to (Theoretical Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units (330 + 384 = 714), I force the backend to place an order that compensates for the lost stock. Recent demand spiked to 157 in Period 12, so I will use a slightly higher forecast. L=2 is maintained as recent shipments (Period 8, 10) arrived on time.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory is corrupted by 384 lost units (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108). mu_hat must be explicitly inflated until these units are manually cleared or accounted for to prevent permanent stockouts.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a severe inventory management challenge due to 384 units lost in transit from Periods 1, 3, and 4. These 'phantom units' remain in the in-transit field (750 total), which trick the OR backend into under-ordering because it assumes they will arrive. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. Demand analysis: Current seasonality (May) for women's underwear is stable with a mean around 105 units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover (1+L=3) periods. 3 * 105 = 315. However, since the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (750) from its target (base_stock), and 384 of those 750 units are non-existent, I must add 384 to the desired base_stock to ensure a physical order is placed. Desired Base Stock = (Target for 3 periods) + Lost Units = 315 + 384 = 699. I set mu_hat to 699 to force the backend to account for the lost stock. I use sigma_hat 'default' to handle historical volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15 (May 20th). The system shows 750 units in-transit, but historical record analysis confirms that 384 units (Period 1: 218, Period 3: 58, Period 4: 108) are lost shipments that will likely never arrive. Subtracting these from the 750 visible in-transit units yields an 'actual' pipeline of 366 units (P10: 196, P13: 170). The shipment from P10 (196 units) is expected to arrive this period (P15), but it is not yet visible in our on-hand inventory. Recent demand (last 5 samples) averages ~93 units/period. To mitigate the OR engine's reliance on the 'ghost' pipeline inventory (384 lost units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. This 'explicit' value represents the desired base stock (inventory + pipeline) required to cover the lead time (2) plus current period (L+1=3). Base target = avg_demand * (L+1) + lost_units = 93 * 3 + 384 = 663. By setting mu_hat = 663 and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility, the OR engine will calculate an order that accounts for the fact that nearly 400 'in-transit' units do not exists.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16. The product is Ellen Thong 3pk (underwear), which shows steady non-seasonal demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods has averaged 99.2 units. The primary issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 750 units, which contains 384 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. The backend OR engine uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide orders. If pipeline_inventory is 750 but 384 units are lost, the OR engine will 'see' 366 units that don't exist, leading it to under-order and causing persistent stockouts. To fix this without an 'explicit' order command, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the missing 384 units. Target base stock should be (Expected Demand during L+1) + (Lost Units). Estimated weekly demand is ~100. With L=2, L+1=3. Expected demand = 300. Adding the 384 lost units, I set mu_hat to 684. This forces the OR engine to order enough to cover both future demand and the 'hole' left by the ghost inventory. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P8) suggest the 2-period lead time has stabilized.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883009 currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 750 units in-transit. However, historical data confirms that 384 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are lost (never arrived despite L=2). This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 366 units (750 - 384). Because the OR engine calculates orders as (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of these 384 phantom units in the pipeline prevents the engine from ordering sufficient stock. In Period 16, demand was 96, and the average demand over the last 5 periods is approx 85. With a lead time of 2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~255 units). Since on-hand is 0 and the backend sees a pipeline of 750, it will not order anything unless we explicitly inflate mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline. I am setting mu_hat to 650 (explicit) to force the backend to place an order that addresses the current stockout, while keeping L=2 as recent shipments (P8) arrived on time.

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockout persists due to 384 lost units (P1, P3, P4) clogging pipeline inventory. Inflation of mu_hat via 'explicit' method is required to override the backend's pipeline deduction until 'In-transit' is corrected or cleared.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 750 units is severely inflated by multiple lost shipments from Period 1 (218), Period 3 (58), and Period 4 (108), totaling 384 units that will never arrive. Because the backend OR logic subtracts the full pipeline (750) from the target base stock, it calculates an order of 0, effectively freezing our supply chain. To counteract this, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~106 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (L=2), the coverage period is 3 (1+L). A standard mu_hat would be ~318. However, to force a new order of ~200 units through despite the 384 units of 'ghost' inventory, I am setting mu_hat = 318 + 384 = 702. This 'over-biasing' is the only way to bypass the backend's pipeline deduction and resume replenishment.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883009 is currently experiencing a severe and prolonged stockout. Investigation of the history reveals that 384 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are permanently lost but still reside in 'In-transit' (750 total in-transit - 384 phantom units = 366 real units in transit). The backend OR logic subtracts the full 750 units of pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, preventing any new orders from being placed. Recent demand (P17: 177, P18: 201) shows a significant upward trend compared to the earlier average of ~100. To force the OR engine to place an order, I must set mu_hat (target inventory) to exceed the phantom pipeline. Based on current demand (~190/week), target inventory for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) should be ~570. Adding the 384 lost units to this requirement, I set mu_hat explicitly to 950. This 'inflation' allows the system to recognize that existing pipeline is insufficient for real-world needs.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe stockout situation with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has increased significantly over the last three weeks, averaging approx. 194 units per week, compared to the overall sample average of ~132. The 'In-transit' count of 950 units is highly misleading because it includes 384 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost, as well as several subsequent orders that have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2 periods. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (950) from the base stock calculation, which would result in zero orders being placed if we used standard parameters. To circumvent this and force replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the necessary base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of the current high demand (194 * 3 = 582) plus a safety buffer, and then I add the 384 'phantom' units to this target. This forces the OR engine to place an order despite the bloated in-transit figure. L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed history of 2 periods for the few successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P17-P19) has shifted upwards to ~200 units/period from a baseline of ~100-130. Pipeline inventory remains corrupted by 384 lost units, requiring explicit mu_hat inflation.

The situation for SKU 507883009 is critical due to a systemic stockout exacerbated by 384 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, and P4) that are lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count. Total In-transit is currently 1100 units, which includes the 384 lost units plus orders from P8 (arrived), P10 (arrived), P13 (overdue), P19, and P20. Specifically, P13's order (170 units) is now 8 periods overdue and likely lost. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted from a baseline of ~100 to ~200 units/period (P17-P20 avg: 199.25). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1100 In-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering entirely unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to override this calculation. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered for the (L+1)=3 periods of demand coverage needed, and to compensate for the ~554 units of likely lost inventory (384 legacy + 170 from P13), I set mu_hat explicitly to 1150. Based on L=2, this targets a base stock that accounts for the ghost pipeline and satisfies the new demand regime of ~200/week. Standard lead time of 2 is used as recent successful arrivals confirmed this timing.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: P13 shipment (170 units) is now 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing total lost 'ghost' inventory to 554 units (P1, P3, P4, P13).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 22 (July 2019). The SKU (Women's Underwear) is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely seasonal, with the last 5 periods (P17-P21) averaging ~206 units/period, compared to the previous baseline of ~100. Supply chain analysis indicates a massive discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory: 1150 units are listed, but 554 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13). Subtracting these 'ghost' units leaves a real pipeline of 596 units (P19=200, P20=150, P21=50, plus pending orders from P10/P13 residue). The OR engine's logic (order = base_stock - pipeline) will see 1150 units in transit and refuse to order, leading to certain stockouts since more than half of that pipeline is non-existent. To solve this, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand (L+1) = (2+1) * 206 = 618. I must inflate this by the amount of ghost inventory (554) to force the OR backend to place a restorative order. Final mu_hat = 618 + 554 = 1172 units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current high volatility during the spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Average demand P17-P21 is 206 (+100% vs baseline). Total 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments is 554 units (P1, P3, P4, P13).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883009 (Women's Underwear) is experiencing a sustained demand surge, with demand in Period 22 reaching 263 units. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is approximately 215 units/period, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. However, the supply chain is heavily corrupted. There are 554 units of 'ghost' inventory (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108, P13: 170) which are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 1022. The backend OR logic subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, preventing new orders from being placed. To counteract this, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2, mean=215, current target should be ~645 units + safety. Since 554 units are ghost units, I set mu_hat (which the backend treats as (1+L)*demand) to a value that overrides the 554 ghost units plus the legitimate in-transit units (P19, P21, P22) to trigger an order that meets current demand. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P20 arrival in P22) confirmed the 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge significantly accelerated: mean P17-P22 is 215 (+115% vs baseline). Ghost inventory remains at 554 units (P1, P3, P4, P13).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '507883009' is currently experiencing a massive demand surge combined with a significant 'ghost inventory' problem. Ghost inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P13 totalling 554 units) stays in 'In-transit', causing the OR backend to believe inventory levels are higher than they truly are, thus under-ordering. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. 

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P17-P23) has spiked significantly: [177, 201, 203, 216, 233, 263, 164]. The mean of the last 7 periods is approx 208, with high volatility. 
Target Logic: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. 
With L=2, mu_hat represents (1+L) periods of demand. 
Required coverage = 3 periods * 208 units/period = 624 units. 
To bypass the 554 units of ghost inventory, I must set an explicit mu_hat such that: (mu_hat - 554) \u2248 624. 
Target mu_hat = 1178. 

I will use explicit mu_hat to force the backend to place an order despite the phantom 554 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Updated total 'ghost' inventory to 554 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). Lead time for recent valid shipments (P20, P21, P22) has stabilized at 1-2 periods. Demand remains in a high-sustained regime (avg ~208/week).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/29. The demand context for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) shows a significant regime shift identified around Period 17, where demand increased from ~100 to ~200+ units. Analysis of recent demand (P17-P24: 177, 201, 203, 216, 233, 263, 164, 109) shows a mean of 195.6. The drop in the last two periods (P23-P24) follows a very high peak (P22), potentially indicating a stabilization or slight cooling of the surge. The most critical issue is the 'In-transit' inventory of 1228 units, which contains 554 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13). If not corrected, the OR backend will subtract these non-existent units from the calculated base stock, resulting in orders of 0 and prolonged stockouts. To force replenishment while accounting for the ~200 demand regime and 674 units of actual pipeline (P19=200, P20=150, P21=50, P22=22 are concluded; P23=278 is in transit), I must explicitly set mu_hat. Desired base stock for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) at 200 units/period is 600 units. To bypass the system's pipeline deduction (base_stock - 1228), I set mu_hat to 1828 (1228 + 600) using the explicit method. This ensures an order is placed to cover upcoming demand and buffer against lead time volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 26 (2019/8/5), we are managing SKU 507883009. Current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and the pipeline shows 1,828 units. However, as documented in carry-over insights, at least 554 units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13). There is also a major order of 600 units from P25 which won't arrive until P27/P28. Demand analysis: After a surge (P17-P22 avg ~215), the last two weeks have cooled significantly (P23-P25 avg ~132). Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is 50%. The OR backend calculation [order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory] is being neutralized by the 'ghost' inventory (554 units). To force the engine to place necessary orders to cover current demand (avg ~150-180), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat = 1200. Calculation: 1200 (mu_hat) - 1828 (pipeline) = negative, resulting in 0 order. However, I need to account for the fact that the ghost units are gone. To ensure the backend eventually orders when pipeline clears or to compensate for the lost units, I must maintain an inflated mu_hat. Since on-hand is 0 and we are in a persistent stockout, L is set to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P22, P23) show lead times of 1-2 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883009 currently has 172 units on-hand and an inflated In-transit inventory of 1550 units. Carry-over insights confirm that 554 units in the pipeline (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108, P13: 170) are 'ghost' units\u2014orders that have been lost but still count against the ordering logic. To ensure the backend places orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these ghost units. Demand has recently softened from a peak of ~260 to around 110-120 over the last three weeks (P24-P26), aligning more with the early-year baseline after a summer surge. However, to maintain stock despite the 554-unit pipeline error and the 27-period average demand (~132), I estimate the required base stock. Base stock = (L+1)*demand + safety. With L=2 and average demand ~140, base stock should be ~420. To bypass the 1550 in-transit deduction, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Current Pipeline) = 420 + 1550 = 1970. This ensures the OR engine calculates a positive order quantity to maintain availability. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P23 arrived in 3 periods) show slight variance around the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression: Demand has stabilized at ~110 units/period (P24-P26) following the mid-summer surge. Ghost inventory remains at 554 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-19. Demand has consistently stabilized around ~105-110 units/period over the last 4 periods (P24-P27) following the summer surge. Current On-hand inventory is 676 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 1198 units, but 724 units are historically confirmed as 'ghost' lost shipments (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108, P13: 170, P19: 170). Adjusting for these, net real in-transit is ~474 units (P27 order of 248 units + P25 remaining arrivals). However, the OR backend sees 1198 in pipeline and will subtract this from the base stock. To prevent under-ordering or unintended order suppression due to the ghost inventory, I continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the backend's pipeline calculation logic. I target a base stock level that covers 3 periods (L+1) of current demand (~110 * 3 = 330). Since On-hand (676) already exceeds this, the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) will result in a zero order regardless, which is appropriate given the current overstock situation (676 on-hand vs ~110 demand). L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22-P27) show a return to the 2-period promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total 'ghost' inventory confirmed at 724 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, and now P19 which is 9 periods overdue). On-hand inventory is currently high (676), providing a safety buffer despite the pipeline corruption.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26. On-hand inventory is 619, which is approximately 6 periods of supply given the current stabilized demand of ~100 units/week. However, the 'In-transit' column shows 1198 units, which is heavily corrupted by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 19 totaling 724 units). Actual valid in-transit is likely 474 units (1198 - 724). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1198 units in the pipeline and stopping all orders, I must continue using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the base stock calculation, effectively offsetting the 724 ghost units. Demand has clearly regressed from the mid-summer peak (~200+) back to a lower baseline (~100). Average demand of the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 98.2. I will set the per-period forecast at 100. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+L)*100 + Ghost_Units = 300 + 724 = 1024. This ensures the backend maintains a target stock level that accounts for the fact that 724 units in the pipeline will never arrive.

The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime following a mid-summer surge; the average demand for the last 6 periods (P24-P29) is approximately 96 units/period. On-hand inventory is healthy at 532 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1198 is heavily corrupted by 724 units of legendary 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19) which are confirmed lost but still deducted from orders by the OR backend. To compensate for this 724-unit logic error, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2, mean=96, and a safety factor, a base stock of ~450 is ideal. To force the backend to place an order (or at least acknowledge the need) despite the 724-unit pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to 1200 (450 target + 750 ghost buffer). This ensures we maintain availability as on-hand inventory is depleted by upcoming demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-09-09. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime compared to the summer spike, with the last 5 periods (P26-P30) averaging 107.6 units. On-hand inventory is healthy at 636 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 950 units is heavily corrupted by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Based on the Carry-over Insights, we have confirmed losses from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 19, totaling 724 units (218+58+108+170+200=754, checking periods: P1=218, P3=58, P4=108, P13=170, P19=200. Total = 754 units). The backend subtracts this 'pipeline' from the base stock calculation, which would incorrectly prevent new orders if base stock is set naturally. To counteract this 'ghost' inventory of 754 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base_stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~323 units) plus safety stock. Given the high on-hand (636), we don't need to order immediately, but we must ensure the OR engine doesn't see a massive surplus. I'll set mu_hat to a value that reflects current demand (~110/week) plus the ghost inventory to neutralize the pipeline subtraction.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 754 units (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108, P13: 170, P19: 200). Recent lead times (P25, P27) are 2-3 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507883009 currently has an inflated 'In-transit' figure of 950 units due to systemic shipment losses. Based on CARRY-OVER insights, there are 754 units confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108, P13: 170, P19: 200). Subtracting these from the current 950 units in-transit leaves an actual pipeline inventory of 196 units. Current on-hand inventory is 511 units, which is quite healthy. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean following the summer surge; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 102 units/period. The current stock (511 on-hand + 196 actual in-transit = 707) easily covers 6-7 weeks of demand at the current rate. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 950 units of pipeline and refusing to order in the future, I must continue to manage the ghost inventory. However, with 511 units on hand and 196 actual units arriving, no additional order is needed this period. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the ghost inventory gap to ensure the system is ready to order once on-hand levels drop for the current L=2 lead time.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable demand regime following a mid-summer surge. Recent demand (P28-P32) shows a mean of approximately 102 units. On-hand inventory is healthy at 412 units. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 950 units is severely corrupted by 754 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108, P13: 170, P19: 200). The actual reliable pipeline is only 196 units (from P10, but that was long ago \u2013 actually looking at history, only P27 arrived recently, meaning 'In-transit' is primarily old lost orders). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 950 units in transit and refusing to order when on-hand drops, I must continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*102 + Ghost_Inventory. With L=2, this is 3*102 + 754 = 1060. This 'tricks' the backend into thinking demand is high enough to justify the existing 'pipeline' while maintaining a safety stock based on actual 102-unit demand levels. Sigma is set based on the last 10 periods to capture recent volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/09/30. On-hand inventory is 211, and in-transit is 950. However, the pipeline is severely corrupted by 'ghost' inventory from historical lost shipments. Based on the Carry-over insights, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P19 are long-overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 754 units (218+58+108+170+200). Subtracting these from the 950 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 196 units (presumably the P27 order or similar recent activity). Demand has been volatile but recently stabilized around ~120-140 units, with a spike to 201 in P33. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously subtracting the 754 ghost units from the calculated base stock (which would lead to ordering nothing), I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target inventory level. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*140 + 754 = (1+2)*140 + 754 = 1174. This effectively 'neutralizes' the ghost inventory and maintains a 140-unit/period target demand level.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. Demand has returned to a stable but slightly higher level (~145 units/period over the last 5 periods: 144, 125, 99, 201, 158). The 'In-transit' inventory of 963 units is severely corrupted by 754 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P19). Only ~209 units (P27 and P34) are actually viable in the pipeline. With On-hand at 53 and viable pipeline around 209, we need to order to meet demand for the next L+1 periods. The OR backend's standard calc (base_stock - pipeline) will see 963 in-transit and refuse to order. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock (L=2, so 3 periods of demand coverage). Target base stock = 3 * 150 (projected mean) + safety stock (~1.64 * sqrt(3) * 30) \u2248 450 + 85 = 535. To force an order of approximately 250 units (535 minus true inventory 53+209), I must provide an explicit mu_hat that, when the backend subtracts the 963 ghost units, still results in a positive order. I set mu_hat = 1500 to ensure the backend triggers the safety cap and maintains a healthy flow of goods despite the pipeline distortion.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a stockout in Period 35. Total in-transit inventory is 1447 units, but this includes a cumulative 754 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 19) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is approximately 693 units (1447 - 754). Recent demand (P33-P35) has averaged 165 units, which is higher than the baseline of 110-120 observed in August. Since the OR backend deducts the full 1447 in-transit units from its base_stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target and force an order. To cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~165 units/period plus the 754 ghost units being erroneously deducted, the mu_hat is set to 1250 units (3 * 165 + 754 approx). Lead time remains stabilized at 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-262.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a systemic 'ghost inventory' issue where 754 units are permanently stuck in 'In-transit' status due to confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). As of Period 37, 'In-transit' is 963, meaning only 209 units (963 - 754) are actual viable incoming stock (from P34). Current on-hand is 373. Recent demand (P24-P36) has stabilized after a summer surge, averaging approximately 119 units per period. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=13 covers this stable period. However, because the backend subtracts the full pipeline (963) from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 754 lost units. Calculation: Base Stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and mean demand=119, Base Stock Target = 3 * 119 = 357. To force the OR engine to order despite the 963 pipeline, I set mu_hat = 357 + 963 = 1320. This ensures the calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order if on-hand is low, or covers the demand requirements while the inventory state is corrupted.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory remains at 754 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Recent demand (P24-P36) average is 119/period. Shipment from P35 arrived in 1 period, suggesting lead times are currently 1-2 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 38 (late October). On-hand inventory is 252. The 'In-transit' figure of 963 is heavily corrupted by 754 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). This means the actual functional pipeline is only 209 units (963 - 754). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to override the base stock calculation. I estimate the current demand regime (P24-P37) to be approximately 120 units per period. Using a 3-period coverage goal (L+1, where L=2), the target base stock is 360 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full 963 units of pipeline from its calculated base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when minus 963, results in the desired order. Based on the target of 360, the inflated mu_hat should be 360 + 963 = 1323. This ensures the engine places an order to maintain a service level consistent with actual demand and valid inventory. Lead times for recent healthy shipments fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, so I maintain L at the default promised lead time of 2.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are entering the pre-holiday season, and demand for this category (Underwear) may see some upward volatility as evidenced by the spike to 208 units in the last period. On-hand inventory is low (44 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 1071 units is severely corrupted by 754 units of consolidated 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1: 218, P3: 58, P4: 108, P13: 170, P19: 200). The true pipeline inventory is approximately 317 units (1071 - 754), consisting of orders from P34 (13), P35 (0, arrived), P38 (108), and the current P39 order. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (corrupted) pipeline from its base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock level, effectively 'hiding' the ghost inventory from the calculation. I calculate the target mu_hat for (L+1) periods (approx 3) using a recent demand average of ~135 units/period, then add the 754 ghost units to offset the backend's deduction. Target Stock = (3 * 135) + 754 \u2248 1159. Lead time is stabilized at 2 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation in Period 40 is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is expected to spike as we approach the holiday season. Historical analysis shows a 'ghost' pipeline of 754 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19) which the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from any order calculations. Total In-transit is currently 1115; subtracting the ghost units (754) and the very recent orders (P38: 108, P39: 44), there is likely zero reliable stock arriving immediately. Demand over the last 15 periods (since the summer surge ended) averages 132 units/period. However, with Black Friday and the holiday season approaching in November/December for this 'Womens Lingerie' SKU, demand is likely to escalate. To bypass the backend's 'ghost' inventory deduction and secure stock for the holiday rush, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at an anticipated holiday-adjusted rate of ~220 units/period (total 660) plus an additional 754 units to offset the pipeline corruption, resulting in a target mu_hat of 1414. This forces the engine to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Lead time is set to default (2), which is consistent with recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost inventory remains 754 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Seasonal demand spike for Lingerie/Underwear expected starting mid-November through December; using explicit mu_hat inflation to bypass pipeline corruption and prepare for holiday volume.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019). The target SKU is Ellen Thong 3pk (Womens Lingerie). Historically, we anticipate a seasonal demand spike starting mid-November through December. Current demand has been averaging ~119 units/period, but recently spiked to 208 in P38. Total 'ghost' inventory is 754 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19), which clogs the OR backend pipeline calculation. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. With an expected holiday surge, I forecast demand at ~200 units/period. For a lead time of 2, I need a base stock covering 3 periods (600 units). Adding the 754 ghost units to this targets a base stock of ~1354. However, the backend 'cap' formula often limits orders. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1354 to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 1414 units currently 'in-transit' (which includes the 754 ghost units + recent orders of 108, 44, 299). On-hand is 0, so urgent replenishment is needed. Lead time (L) is set to 2 based on recent history (P35 arrived in 1, P27 in 3).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the peak holiday season (late November) for the 'Womens Lingerie' category. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure (1370) is heavily corrupted by 754 units of 'ghost inventory' (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19) which were confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights. Subtracting these ghost units, the true reliable pipeline is 1370 - 754 = 616 units. These 616 units are from recent orders (P38, P40), with P38 (108 units) now 4 periods overdue and potentially lost or delayed. Recent lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure we have enough stock for the December demand spike while the backend's pipeline deduction is inflated by ghost units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate holiday demand at ~200 units/period. For a lead time of 2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods, which equals 600 units. To bypass the backend's likely deduction of the 1370 in-transit units, I will set mu_hat significantly higher (600 base + 754 lost units = 1354) to force the OR engine to place an order that restores physical availability.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: True reliable pipeline is 616 units (1370 total - 754 confirmed ghost units). P38 (108 units) is now 4 periods overdue, potentially increasing ghost inventory to 862 units if it does not arrive by Period 43.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we are in the peak holiday season for lingerie. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1370 units is heavily corrupted by 754 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Additionally, the P38 order (108 units) is now 5 periods overdue, increasing likely ghost inventory to 862 units. The 'true' pipeline is roughly 508 units (1370 - 862). Realized demand in recent weeks (excl. stockouts) has stabilized around 110-120, but holiday seasonality suggests a significant upward shift. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the backend's pipeline deduction (order = base_stock - in_transit). To target a base stock of ~1200 (covering 3 periods of ~400 units to account for holiday spikes and lead time), and given the total pipeline is 1370, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 1370' results in a meaningful replenishment order. By setting mu_hat=1800, the OR engine will calculate a base_stock high enough to overcome the ghost inventory and trigger an order of approximately 430 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: P38 shipment (108 units) is now 5 periods overdue and added to ghost inventory. Total ghost inventory is likely 862 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P38). Pipeline corruption remains the primary driver for using explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the middle of the holiday peak for the Lingerie/Underwear category. Demand has been volatile but is expected to remain firm through December. The 'In-transit' figure of 1501 units is heavily corrupted by an estimated 862 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, and P38), meaning the true reliable pipeline is only 639 units. With 250 units on hand and a true pipeline of 639, we have 889 units available for the next 3 periods (L+1). Recent demand (P38-P43) has averaged approximately 107 units, but this includes a period of stockout and the start of the holiday season. Using an explicit mu_hat of 1200 reflects a target base stock of 400 units per period (1200 / 3) to bypass the pipeline corruption (which the OR engine would otherwise subtract from the order). This ensures the backend continues to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' count. Lead time remains set to 2, though actual arrivals vary between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday shopping period (Dec 16). Historical demand for this lingerie SKU shows volatility, and we are still managing a significant 'ghost' inventory issue where 862 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P38) are in-transit but lost. These 862 units are subtracted from the backend's order calculation, leading to permanent under-ordering unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated. Current on-hand is 183. The pipeline includes the P43 order (430 units) which is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods given recent lead times (P39: 2, P40: 3). To bypass the pipeline corruption during the high-demand December/January window, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock (for L=2) to be roughly 3-4 weeks of demand (~120 units/week * 3 = 360). To offset the 862 ghost units being subtracted, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1222. However, with 183 on-hand and 430 real units in transit (Total 613 real units), and demand currently soft (P43: 49, P44: 67), I will target a slightly lower explicit mu_hat of 1100 to avoid excessive holding costs while the P43 shipment arrives.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), at the peak of the holiday shopping season. Demand for 'Ellen Thong' (Womens Lingerie) typically remains elevated through the end of the year. Recent demand (P43-P45) has been lower (avg 60), but this follows a pre-holiday lull; we expect a final seasonal push or steady clearance. The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 1071. Confirmed ghost units (lost shipments) are P1 (218), P3 (58), P4 (108), P13 (170), P19 (200), and P38 (108), totaling 862 units. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is only 1071 - 862 = 209 units (consisting of the small P34 order and potential recent invisible orders). With on-hand inventory at 548 and a reliable pipeline of 209, we have 757 units available to cover demand. Given the ghost inventory clogging the backend's pipeline deduction, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the OR engine maintains an appropriate stock level for the holiday period without being misled by the 862 units that will never arrive. I'll set mu_hat based on an expected holiday demand of ~150/week over the 3-period (L+1) window, while setting sigma_hat to reflect high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost inventory confirmed at 862 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P38). Seasonal peak for lingerie occurs Dec-Jan; maintaining higher safety stock despite recent low demand observations.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (2019/12/30), we are in the peak holiday/post-holiday season for lingerie. While recent demand (P43-P46) has been unusually low (average ~58 units), the context of the product (lingerie) and calendar suggests a high potential for a demand spike in the coming weeks. The primary challenge remains 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Total in-transit inventory is 1071 units, but 862 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P38). This leaves a 'true' pipeline of 209 units. Combined with 497 units on-hand, our real total coverage is 706 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 862 units of ghost inventory, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) at a forecasted holiday rate of 150 units/period (450 units) PLUS the 862 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine will incorrectly subtract from the order. Setting mu_hat to 1312 (450 + 862) forces the backend to recognize the need for maintaining inventory levels without being misled by the corrupted pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set somewhat high to account for seasonal volatility.
