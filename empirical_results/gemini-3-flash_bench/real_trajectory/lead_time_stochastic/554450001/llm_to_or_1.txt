Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 554450001 (Women's Skinny Denim). Historical demand samples from January to early February show a mean of ~218.6 units/week (220, 197, 219, 212, 245). There is no inventory on-hand or in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Given the product type and the early February demand of 245, there is a slight upward trend, possibly related to spring seasonal preparation. I will use the 'default' method for lead time (L=2) and demand statistics (mu_hat, sigma_hat) to establish a baseline. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR engine will target a 50% service level (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), which corresponds to a base stock targeting the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L = 3 periods). Setting L to default (2) and using default statistics will provide a stable starting point while we gather more data on actual lead times and current demand regimes.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a pair of skinny denim trousers, which typically has relatively steady year-round demand but can see spikes during seasonal transitions. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 241 units, which is consistent with the provided historical samples (mean ~217 over 5 weeks, with a slight upward trend in the last sample of 245). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the first order (248 units) is still in-transit due to the promised lead time of 2 periods. We expect this order to arrive in Period 3. For Period 2, I will use recent historical data to set the demand forecast. Since we only have 6 total data points (5 historical + 1 from Period 1), I'll use all 6 to establish the mean and standard deviation. The 'recent_N' method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the most recent information without over-weighting the slightly higher Period 1 demand. L is set to default as we have no evidence yet that the promised 2-period lead time is incorrect.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a standard apparel item. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean of 218.6 units. In Period 1 and 2, demand was 241 and 258 respectively, indicating a slight upward trend or seasonality as we move into spring. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (248 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. The order from Period 2 (253 units) is expected in Period 4. Total in-transit is 501. Current on-hand is 0, and we have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because we started with 0 inventory. To stabilize, I will use a recent demand window (N=5 including the pre-game samples) to capture the current demand level of ~220-250 units. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR engine will target a 50% service level (z=0), effectively aiming for the mean demand. I'll maintain 'default' lead time (2) as there's no evidence yet of delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch denim trouser from the Divided Collection. Demand data (samples and Periods 1-3) show a relatively stable mean around 220 units. Current Period is 4 (March 4). Seasonality for denim is generally stable in early spring. Total demand across history is [220, 197, 219, 212, 245, 241, 258, 167], with a mean of 219.8 and std dev of 28.5. Promised lead time is 2. Orders from P1 (248 units), P2 (253 units), and P3 (204 units) are in-transit (Total 705). The P1 order (placed 2/11) should arrive during P3 and be visible in the P3 conclude, but it hasn't arrived yet. However, the timing definition states that an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3 and is visible in P4 start. We are currently at P4 start. If it doesn't show in P1/P2/P3 conclude, it might arrive during P4. I will maintain the promised lead time of 2 for now as no order is strictly 'overdue' yet by the observation rules. I will use recent_N=5 for demand and sigma to capture the slightly higher recent variance and mean.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Julia RW Skinny Denim, a staple trouser item. Current period is March 11 (Early Spring). Demand history shows initial samples [220, 197, 219, 212, 245] and realized demand in Periods 1-4 [241, 258, 167, 179]. There is a noticeable drop in demand starting Period 3 (from ~245 to ~173), suggesting a shift from late winter peaks to early spring normalization or a post-launch stabilization. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). The Period 1 order (248 units) is currently late or missing (should have arrived in Period 3). I have 74 units on-hand and 452 in-transit (P1 order: 248, P3 order: 204). To account for the recent lower demand trend, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Since one shipment is late, I will maintain 'default' lead time of 2 as there isn't enough evidence yet for a structural lead-time shift, but I am monitoring the P1 shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Julia RW Skinny Denim, a staple denim item. Looking at the history, Period 1's order for 248 units (placed P1, expected P3) is still missing and appears lost, as it is now Period 6. Period 2's order arrived precisely on time (lead_time=2). Current on-hand is 0 due to the missing Period 1 shipment, causing a stockout in Period 5. The total pipeline is 530 units (Order P1: 248 [lost?], Order P2: arrived, Order P3: 204 [overdue?], Order P5: 78). However, the in-transit field reflects 530, which likely includes the P1(248), P3(204), and P5(78) orders. Demand has softened slightly from ~240 in early Feb to ~170 in early March. Given the uncertainty of the P1 order and the potential delay of P3, I will set lead time to 3 to be safe. I will use recent_N=3 for demand (mean ~170) to capture the recent lower trend, while maintaining a higher sigma to buffer against the supply instability.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. The SKU is skinny denim trousers. Looking at historical arrivals: Period 4 arrived (ordered P2, LT=2) and Period 6 arrived (ordered P5, LT=1). However, the order from Period 1 (248 units) and Period 3 (204 units) have not arrived despite the promised lead time being 2. This indicates high lead-time volatility or lost shipments. Total In-transit is 604 (P1: 248, P3: 204, P6: 152). Since P1 and P3 are past due, they are likely lost or severely delayed. On-hand is 0, and we have stocked out for two consecutive periods (P5, P6). Demand has stabilized around a lower mean following the initial peak: the last 3 periods (P4-P6) show a mean of 173.67, while the full history (including seed data) has a mean of 210. I will use recent demand (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current pace while accounting for volatility. I will keep L at 'calculate' to let the engine average the observed 2 and 1 period lead times, but monitor for lost shipments next period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is Julia RW Skinny Denim, currently in early April. Historical demand samples (late Jan-Feb) were higher (avg ~218), but the most recent 7 periods in simulation show a lower, stabilized demand regime averaging approximately 178 units per period (N=7). Period 7 conclude shows 0 on-hand and 604 in-transit. Looking at the arrival history: Period 4 arrived an order from Period 2 (L=2); Period 6 arrived an order from Period 5 (L=1). The order from Period 1 (248 units) is significantly overdue (7 periods since order) and is likely lost. The order from Period 3 (204 units) is also overdue (5 periods since order) and likely lost. The 604 in-transit units consist of Period 1 (248), Period 2 (already arrived), Period 3 (204), Period 6 (152), and any previous gaps. Since the OR engine's pipeline inventory includes these likely lost units, it will under-order unless the base stock target is high. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed lead times (1 and 2), set mu_hat using the recent 7-period average (~178 * 3 = 534) to reflect the stabilized demand, and use 'recent_N' for sigma to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1: stabilized at avg ~178 per week, down from ~218 pre-simulation. Shipments from Period 1 (248 units) and Period 3 (204 units) appear lost as they are >4 periods past promised lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing Julia RW Skinny Denim. The recent demand regime (Periods 3-8) averages 175.5 units per week, which is lower than the pre-simulation average of ~218. Shipments from Period 1 (248 units) and Period 3 (204 units) are now clearly lost, as they are 7 and 5 periods overdue respectively compared to the promised lead time of 2. These lost units are stuck in 'In-transit' (Total: 452), which tricks the OR backend into under-ordering because it assumes they will arrive. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I am keeping L at the promised 2 to ensure the backend projects demand over 3 periods (L+1). I am setting mu_hat to 528 (3 * 176) to reflect the current demand regime. Crucially, I am setting sigma_hat to a very high 'explicit' value (500) to force the base stock high enough to override the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and trigger a replenishment order. The current on-hand is 0, and we have missed substantial sales; aggressive replenishment is required.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (248 units) and Period 3 (204 units) are confirmed lost (5+ periods overdue). In-transit inventory of 452 units is 'phantom' and should be ignored for replenishment logic.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 10, SKU 554450001 (Women's Skinny Denim). Calendar: Mid-April. Demand analysis: The last 6 weeks (Periods 4-9) show a mean demand of 166 units, which is a shift from the pre-simulation and early-period highs (>200). Most recent demand was 111, possibly a slight dip or volatility. Lead time analysis: Promised L=2. Observations show L=2 (P2->P4, P6->P8) and L=1 (P5->P6). Crucially, Period 1 (248 units) and Period 3 (204 units) orders are missing for 9 and 7 periods respectively and must be treated as lost. Current In-transit (528) contains these 452 units of phantom inventory (248+204=452), plus 76 units ordered in P9. Accounting for this, effective pipeline is only 76 units. On-hand is 0. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the pipeline gap and expected demand, I will use 'explicit' L=2 to match the promise/mode. For mu_hat, I will set an explicit value to bypass the OR engine's inclusion of phantom pipeline inventory. To calculate target: (1+L)*166 = 3*166 = 498. Since backend order = base_stock - pipeline, and backend sees pipeline as 528, I need to set base_stock (mu_hat + safety) high enough to overcome the 452-unit phantom. Target mu_hat = 498 (demand) + 452 (offset) = 950.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22nd. Demand for skinny denim trousers has shown a downward trend, averaging ~180 since simulation start, and dropping to ~98 over the last two weeks as weather warms (potential seasonal transition). Lead times are varying between 1 and 2 periods. The most critical issue remains 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Previously suspected losses from Period 1 (248 units) and Period 3 (204 units) ARE confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from Period 10 (369 units) is in-transit (L=2). Total 'real' in-transit is 369. However, the system reports 821 in-transit (821 - 369 = 452 units lost). To force the OR backend's inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) to reflect reality, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to offset the 452 units it thinks it has but doesn't. Target base stock = (1+L)*180 + z*sigma. For L=2, base stock should be ~540 + safety stock. By setting mu_hat high (e.g., ~1100), the backend (which sees 821 in-transit) will order 1100 - 821 = 279 units, which aligns with replacing the current stockout and covering 3 weeks of demand (180*3=540). I keep L at default as 2 is the promised and typical max observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Systematic stockouts due to phantom in-transit inventory (452 units lost from P1/P3). Demand since P1 has stabilized to a mean of 178 but recent 2-week demand dropped to ~98, suggesting seasonal softening for denim.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29, 2019), the system faces a critical inventory shortage. We have 0 on-hand units and 1100 units in-transit. Based on historical data, shipments from Period 1 (ordered 248) and Period 3 (ordered 204) are definitively lost (11 and 9 periods overdue respectively, vs. L=2). This means 452 units of the 'in-transit' total are phantom. The OR backend subtracts the full 1100 from its base_stock target, causing it to under-order significantly. To counteract this 'phantom' inventory, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter by the lost amount (452 units). 

Regarding demand, we see a clear downward trend: the initial pre-game average was ~218, Periods 1-8 averaged ~178, and the most recent 3 periods (9-11) averaged ~95 (84-111 range). This suggests a seasonal shift as we move into warmer late-spring/summer months for skinny denim. 

Calculation: The target mu_hat should ideally be (1+L)*mean_recent. With L=2, (1+2)*95 = 285. To offset the 452 units the OR backend wrongly thinks we have coming, I will set mu_hat (explicit) to 285 + 452 = 737. This forces the engine to place a recovery order despite the high in-transit count. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: April demand dropped ~45% from March levels (avg 178 to ~95), suggesting seasonal cooling for the skinny denim category as summer approaches.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand has shifted significantly: early data (Feb/Mar) showed an average of ~178 units/week, but April data shows a drop to ~102 units/week (last 4 periods: 111, 84, 89, 126). This aligns with seasonal softening for 'Superstretch Denim' as warmer months arrive. Regarding logistics, the inventory reported as 'In-transit' (1100 units) is misleading. We have confirmed in Carry-over Insights that orders from Period 1 (248) and Period 3 (204) are lost. Subtracting these 452 units leaves 648 valid units in-transit (Orders from P10: 369 and P11: 279). Neither P10 nor P11 orders have arrived as of the end of P12, which matches the promised lead time of 2. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). To optimize for the lower seasonal demand (~100 units/week) while accounting for the 'phantom' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*100 = 300. This informs the OR backend to aim for a base stock around 300. Since the OR engine calculates pipeline as 1100, it would normally stop ordering. By using a slightly higher explicit mu_hat and a stable sigma, we bridge the gap created by the 452 lost units to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). Historical demand for this Julia RW Skinny Denim SKU has dropped from an average of ~178 (Feb-Mar) to ~98 (April-May), reflecting seasonal softening as temperatures rise and consumer preference shifts away from heavy superstretch denim. In-transit inventory includes 452 units confirmed lost from Periods 1 and 3, which must be bypassed. The remaining active pipeline (since P10/P11) and recent arrivals have restored on-hand inventory to 171 units. Given the lower May demand regime (avg ~95-108), the 171 units on-hand plus valid in-transit units from Period 10 (369 units) are more than sufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the lower demand mean (approx 103) and volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period lead time variability. No new order is expected to be placed by the OR backend due to the existing healthy stock and the 'phantom' units still technically in the pipeline count.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), we are managing a skinny denim SKU. Historical data shows a significant demand regime shift: early periods (P1-P8) averaged ~178 units, while more recent periods (P9-P14) have averaged ~111 units, likely due to seasonal cooling as summer approaches. We must reconcile the 'In-transit' figure of 821 units. Based on history: Period 1 (ordered 248) and Period 3 (ordered 204) are definitively lost (10+ periods overdue). Period 10 (ordered 369) is currently 5 periods old; since the promised lead time is 2 and the maximum observed lead time is 2, this shipment is also highly likely lost or severely delayed. These three 'phantom' shipments sum to 821 units, which exactly matches the reported 'In-transit' level. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. With only 19 units on-hand and a 2-period lead time, we are at risk of a stockout. I will set mu_hat using the recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture the lower 111-unit trend, and use an explicit lead time L=2 to reflect the promised window, while setting a high mu_hat/sigma_hat to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the phantom in-transit inventory to trigger an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Shipment from Period 10 (369 units) is over 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining losses from P1 (248) and P3 (204). Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory is 821 units. Demand remains stable around a mean of 111 (last 6 periods).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), the SKU continues to face significant supply chain reliability issues. Confirmed lost shipments from P1 (248), P3 (204), and P10 (369) total 821 units, which the OR backend incorrectly views as 'in-transit'. This results in a massive underestimation of the needed replenishment because the backend thinks the 'pipeline' is full. The current In-transit total is 1131, but subtracting the 821 phantom units leaves only 310 units actually on the way (ordered P15, expected P17). Because the backend's base stock logic is (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom inventory to force an order. Since the end of April, demand for these skinny jeans has stabilized around 110-120 units per week. To offset the 821 phantom units and establish a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock, I will set mu_hat to 1250. This target ensures the OR engine computes: 1250 - 1131 = 119 units ordered (assuming cap allows), which is roughly one week of demand. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P11 order) arrived in the promised 2 periods, but volatility remains high.

Carry-over insight: P16: Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 821 units (P1, P3, P10). Demand for skinny denim has stabilized at a mean of ~115 units since early May, confirming the seasonal drop from the Feb/March peak of ~180 has bottomed out.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the Julia RW Skinny Denim SKU is in a stabilized demand regime following a seasonal drop in April. Demand over the last 6 periods (P11-P16) has averaged 115.5 units per week, which is significantly lower than the Feb/March peak of ~180. The inventory situation is complicated by 'phantom' in-transit inventory: shipments from P1 (248), P3 (204), and now likely P10 (369) are lost, totaling 821 units. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 1250 units, but 821 of these are lost, leaving an actual pipeline of 429 units (P15 order of 310 + P16 order of 119). These legitimate orders are expected to arrive in P17 and P18. To account for the lost shipments and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering (since it subtracts the full 1250 'phantom' units from the target), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (inventory position) for L=2 (Review + Lead time = 3 periods) based on the current mean of 116. Target = 116 * (2+1) = 348. To offset the 821 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 348 + 821 = 1169. This ensures the engine places an order despite the 1250 units in transit showing on the ledger. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent 6 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P17: Phantom in-transit inventory confirmed at 821 units (P1: 248, P3: 204, P10: 369). Actual demand regime has stabilized at ~116 units/week since May. Manual adjustment of mu_hat is required to bypass 'In-transit' ledger errors caused by lost shipments.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), the 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has a current on-hand inventory of 352 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 821 units is entirely comprised of lost shipments from Period 1 (248), Period 3 (204), and Period 10 (369), which are all significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods. These phantom units prevent the OR backend's automated stock-up logic because it believes the pipeline is full. To resolve this, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. Demand since early May (Period 13) has averaged approximately 110 units (108, 152, 114, 104, 77). Setting L=2 (promised), I will forecast a mu_hat of 330 units (representing (1+L) * 110). Since the current on-hand (352) already covers this anticipated demand for the lead time plus review period (3 periods total), the system should correctly decide not to place a new order this cycle. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for moderate volatility around this mean.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (summer). Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has significantly slowed down, likely due to seasonality as heavier denim trousers see lower demand in warmer months. The last two periods showed very low demand (77 and 57 units). Since Period 13, the average weekly demand has been approximately 98 units. On-hand inventory is 295, which covers roughly 3-5 weeks of current demand. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 821 units is entirely comprised of lost shipments (P1: 248, P3: 204, P10: 369) which are never going to arrive. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) in its calculation (ordering 0 if pipeline > base_stock), and the phantom 821 units is significantly higher than any reasonable base stock for a 115-unit/week demand, the system will not order anything until this is addressed. However, since the on-hand inventory of 295 is already sufficient for more than (L+1) periods of demand, I will set mu_hat using the recent demand regime (last 6 periods average ~88 units) to ensure we don't over-order when the system eventually clears these phantom units, but I will not attempt to force an order yet as current stock is high.

Carry-over insight: P19: Demand continues to decline into June (avg ~67 units over last 2 weeks), confirming the seasonal cooling suspected in Period 12 for the denim category.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for skinny denim has clearly entered a summer seasonal trough. Over the last four periods, demand has averaged approximately 90 units (77, 57, 112, and the prior week's trend in the 60-70 range). The In-transit figure of 821 units remains composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in P1 (248), P3 (204), and P10 (369). These orders are far beyond any observed lead time (which is 1-2 periods) and must be assumed lost. Because the OR backend relies on the equation: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit), the presence of 821 phantom units prevents the system from placing any new orders. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat (which determines the base_stock) high enough to overcome the 821-unit subtraction. With 183 units on-hand and 821 phantom in-transit, total perceived inventory is 1004. At a desired 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1 review period) and a current demand mean of ~90, the real base stock should be ~270. To force the engine to consider an order, mu_hat must technically exceed the total perceived inventory. However, since the current on-hand (183) already covers ~2 periods of current demand, and we are in a low-demand season, I will use mu_hat to stabilize the inventory level. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory and the seasonal mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Summer seasonal low for denim confirmed with June demand averaging ~90 units. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains fixed at 821 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. Demand for skinny denim has seasonally declined as summer progressed, with June demand averaging approximately 77 units per week (min 57, max 112). On-hand inventory is 122 units, and the recorded in-transit inventory is 917 units. However, based on history, 821 units are 'phantom' stock from lost shipments (P1: 248, P3: 204, P10: 369). The only valid in-transit shipment is the 96 units ordered in Period 20. Therefore, effective inventory is 122 (on-hand) + 96 (valid in-transit) = 218 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 917 in-transit units and stopping all orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the effective inventory plus a buffer, effectively 'hiding' the phantom units from the internal calculation. Given the current demand (avg ~80) and L=2, the target base stock (L+1 periods) should be around 240-300 units. By setting mu_hat = target_base_stock + phantom_inventory, the backend will calculate: order = (target + 821) - (actual_pipeline + 821), which resolves the math correctly. I will target a base stock of ~280 units (approx 3.5 weeks of current demand) to maintain a safety buffer against the volatility seen in recent weeks, requiring mu_hat to be ~1100.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Effective in-transit stock is only 96 units (ordered P20). The remaining 821 units in the in-transit ledger are indefinitely lost (P1, P3, P10). June/July demand regime has stabilized at a lower summer mean of ~80 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Historical demand for July shows a stable summer regime with a mean of approximately 83 units (based on the last 4 periods: 112, 61, 105, 57). Total In-transit is reported as 978 units, but 821 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units from lost shipments in periods 1 (248), 3 (204), and 10 (369). The effective pipeline inventory consists only of orders from P20 (96) and P21 (61), totaling 157 units. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). With on-hand = 17 and ledger in-transit = 978, the backend sees 995 units of coverage and will not order. To force a replenishment that covers the next 3 weeks (L+1) of demand (~250 units total) while bypassing the 821-unit ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set explicitly. Target coverage = (Demand * (L+1)) + Phantom Inventory. Estimated demand for (L+1) periods is ~250. 250 + 821 = 1071. Setting mu_hat to 1071 and sigma_hat to the standard volatility (sqrt(3)*~25) ensures the order quantity accounts for the missing stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 23 (July 15). Demand for skinny denim has entered a summer trough. The last 3 periods (P20-P22) demand values were 61, 105, 105 (average ~90), confirming the lower summer regime noted in carry-over insights. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' ledger, which shows 958 units. Based on historical tracking, 821 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P1: 248, P3: 204, P10: 369). The 'real' in-transit inventory consists only of orders from P21 (61 units) and P22 (76 units), totaling 137 units. To trigger a replenishment that accounts for this 'phantom' stock, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target stock (Base Stock) should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, we need ~270 units (3 * 90). The OR backend formula is: Order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). Since the backend thinks pipeline=958, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to ensure the calculated base_stock exceeds the phantom pipeline. Specifically, setting mu_hat = 1100 will allow the OR engine to overcome the phantom 821 units and 137 real units to maintain a small buffer for the current on-hand of 8 units. Sigma_hat is set relatively low to reflect the stabilized (though low) seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed summer demand regime mean is ~90 units. Phantom in-transit inventory remains 821 units, necessitating extreme mu_hat inflation until the backend ledger is corrected or orders arrive.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019/7/22), we are in the summer demand regime for skinny denim. Recent demand has stabilized with a mean of approximately 100 units per week (Period 21-23 average is 108). The primary challenge is the 'In-transit' ledger, which contains 821 units of phantom inventory from lost shipments in Period 1 (248), Period 3 (204), and Period 10 (369). The actual effective in-transit inventory is only 134 units (ordered in Period 23). To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 955 units showing as 'in-transit', I must set mu_hat (target pipeline inventory) higher than the total ledger inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 1100 to offset the 821 phantom units and ensure we maintain safety stock for the current 100-unit/week demand. Lead time remains consistently 1-2 periods, so L=2 is appropriate. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for moderate volatility around the summer mean.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019-07-29), the SKU remains hampered by a significantly inflated 'In-transit' ledger. Analysis of the game history confirms that orders from Period 1 (248), Period 3 (204), and Period 10 (369) are lost, totaling 821 'phantom' units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 1069, meaning the actual pipeline stock is 1069 - 821 = 248 units (from P23 and P24). With Period 24 concluding in a stockout (Ending Inventory: 0), and demand stabilizing at a summer mean of ~95 units (last 4 periods: 105, 105, 114, 82), the OR engine needs to place a replenishment order. However, the backend's 'capped policy' logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 1069 units in-transit and likely order 0. To force a replenishment order despite the phantom inventory, I will explicitly set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the total in-transit ledger plus the desired safety stock. Target base stock = Actual Pipeline needed (3 periods * 95) + safety stock (~150) + phantom units (821) \u2248 1250 units. Setting L to default (promised 2) and sigma_hat to recent_N (4) to capture current summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 821 units (P1, P3, P10). Actual summer demand mean (July) is ~95 units. Explicit mu_hat inflation remains necessary to bypass the backend inventory accounting error.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation in Period 26 is critical due to a massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory and zero on-hand stock. Analysis of the ledger: In-transit is reported at 1250 units. However, based on the documented history, 821 units are indefinitely lost (P1: 248, P3: 204, P10: 369). Furthermore, orders from P23 (134), P24 (114), and P25 (181) total 429 units. 821 (lost) + 429 (recent) = 1250 units, confirming the ledger is bloated by 821 units that will never arrive. Demand has shown a subtle summer recovery from ~80 to ~95 units mean. With L=2, the target inventory should cover 3 periods (~285 units). However, the OR backend sees 1250 units 'in pipeline' and will not order unless mu_hat is set to exceed that 1250-unit threshold. To bypass this accounting error and trigger a replenishment of approximately 115 units (to cover upcoming demand), mu_hat is set explicitly to 1365 (1250 ledger + 115 desired order). Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to allow for a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 821 units. Total ledger (1250) = 821 lost + 429 recent (P23-25). July/August demand mean stabilized at ~95 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-12. The product is super-skinny denim, which is currently in its summer demand floor. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (July/August) has averaged 99 units. A major persistent issue is the 'phantom' in-transit inventory from lost shipments in Period 1 (248 units), Period 3 (204 units), and Period 10 (369 units), totaling 821 units. These 821 units are in the ledger but will never arrive. The total in-transit shown is 1231, meaning the actual pipeline inventory is 1231 - 821 = 410 units (ordered in Periods 24, 25, and 26). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' as its order logic. Because the backend pipeline_inventory (1231) is inflated by 821 'phantom' units, the order it calculates will be 821 units lower than necessary, leading to stockouts. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat (target stock level) to include these 821 units. Target level = (L+1) * mean_demand + Lost_Units. Target = (2+1)*99 + 821 = 297 + 821 = 1118. I set mu_hat to 1118 and sigma_hat using recent volatility to avoid over-ordering beyond the accounting error correction.

Carry-over insight: P27: Actual pipeline inventory is 410 units; 821 units (P1, P3, P10) are lost. Demand floor for late summer is stable at ~100 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019/8/19), the 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' is in a late-summer/pre-fall transition. Historically, late August sees a stabilization or slight uptick in denim demand (as evidenced by P27 demand of 170, up from the summer average of ~95). However, the primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The ledger shows 1050 units in-transit, but 821 of these are confirmed lost (Period 1: 248, Period 3: 204, Period 10: 369). The actual actionable pipeline consists of orders from P24 (114 units) and P26 (115 units), totaling 229 units. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to calculate orders, the 821 phantom units will prevent any new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to cover this deficit. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered for the expected fall demand (stabilizing around 150-170 units/week), I set mu_hat to 1350. This accounts for (L+1) weeks of demand (3 * 160 = 480) plus the 821 lost units (480 + 821 = 1301, rounded to 1350 for safety). This ensures the backend calculates an order despite the incorrect ledger.

Carry-over insight: P28: Seasonal transition observed; late August demand rose to 170 units. Phantom in-transit remains 821 units, requiring continued mu_hat inflation of approximately +820 units above forecasted needs to bypass OR backend logic constraints.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system shows On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 1312. Based on historical tracking, 821 units are 'phantom' (lost from Periods 1, 3, and 10). The true pipeline inventory consists of orders from P24 (114), P26 (115), and P28 (262), totaling 491 units. Since 821 + 491 = 1312, this confirms the accounting mismatch. Recent demand from P27-28 shows a significant shift to ~168 units/week (up from ~100), signaling the start of the 'Back to School' or autumn denim season. To ensure the backend OR engine places an order despite the 821 phantom units in its pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be inflated. Calculating target: (L+1) * Expected Demand + Phantom Inventory = (2+1)*170 + 821 = 1331. I will set mu_hat to 1331 via the explicit method and use recent_N for sigma to account for the increased volatility during this demand transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn transition confirmed: late August demand surged to ~168 units/week (+70% vs July). Phantom inventory remains 821 units (P1, P3, P10).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450001' (Julia RW Skinny Denim) is experiencing a seasonal autumn recovery; demand in late August jumped to ~168 units before a recent dip to 113. We expect demand to stabilize around 140-160 as the autumn 'back-to-school' season picks up. Inventory management remains severely hindered by an 821-unit 'phantom' in-transit ledger error (orders from P1, P3, and P10 that are permanently lost). The current ledger shows 1331 units in-transit, but only 510 (1331 - 821) are actual live orders (P24: 114, P25: 181, P26: 115, P28: 262, P29: 19). Note: P24 is now 6 periods old and potentially lost, but we will monitor one more period. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'phantom' 821 units, mu_hat must be inflated. Base demand (1+L)*150 = 450. Adding 821 units offset equals 1271. We set mu_hat to 1275 and reduce sigma_hat to prevent the cap mechanism from restricting the necessary catch-up order after two periods of stockouts.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), we are deep into the autumn transition for denim. Recent demand has surged from its summer low of ~90 units to an average of ~150 units over the last 4 weeks (170, 167, 113, 170). The current in-transit inventory is 1,069 units, but 821 of these are 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P1: 248, P3: 204, P10: 369) that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline is only 248 units (orders from P29 and P31/Current). To force the OR backend\u2014which calculates replenishment as (Base Stock - In-transit)\u2014to place necessary orders, I must continue to manually inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for a (L+1=3) period window with demand at ~150/week is ~450 units. To offset the 821-unit phantom inventory and reach that target, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1,271. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the order is placed despite the ledger error. Lead time is stable at 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: P31: Demand for autumn has stabilized at ~150-160 units/week. Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 821 units. Total In-transit (1069) consists of 821 (lost) and 248 (valid recent orders).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019/09/16), the product is in the autumn season where demand for skinny denim has stabilized at a higher level compared to summer, averaging approximately 160 units/week over the last 5 periods (P27-P31: 170, 167, 113, 170, 185). The central operational challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory totaling 821 units from lost shipments (P1: 248, P3: 204, P10: 369). The current In-transit ledger shows 1179 units, meaning the valid pipeline is only 358 units (P29: 114, P30: 19, P31: 110, plus some lingering late arrivals). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1179 units from the base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this. To maintain a safety stock for roughly 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) plus offset the 821 lost units, the required base stock is approximately (160 * 3) + 821 = 1301. I will set mu_hat to 1300 to trigger an order that covers replenishment needs while accounting for the ledger error. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (approx std of recent volatile demand) scaled for lead time.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak confirmed: Sept demand averaging ~175 units. Phantom inventory remains at 821 units (P1, P3, P10).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 33 (Sept 23, 2019). Demand for skinny denim has entered an autumn peak, with the last 6 periods averaging ~153 units, and the most recent 3 periods averaging ~177 units. On-hand inventory is 0. 

Inventory/Ledger Issue: The in-transit ledger shows 1190 units. Based on historical tracking, 821 units are 'phantom' (lost shipments from P1, P3, and P10). The legitimate pipeline consists of 369 units: P29 (19), P31 (ordered 110, but 110 arrived P32, so this is 0), P32 (121), and P26 (115) which is now 7 periods old and potentially lost, but I will treat P32 and recent orders as the only reliable upcoming stock. The actual reliable pipeline is likely only ~140 units.

OR Backend Logic: The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Because the ledger is inflated by 821 phantom units, it will not place a replenishment order unless base_stock exceeds ~1190. 

Strategy: To force a replenishment order that covers the current demand regime (~175/week), I must explicitly set mu_hat to offset the phantom inventory. Target base_stock should be (L+1) * Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, base_stock should be ~3 * 175 + safety \u2248 600. To get an order of ~175 units, I need (mu_hat - 1190) \u2248 175. Thus, mu_hat is set to 1400. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: P33: Legitimate pipeline inventory is approximately 369 units, but the ledger remains inflated by 821 phantom units (P1, P3, P10). Autumn demand remains strong at ~175 units/week.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn season (late September), evidenced by Period 33 demand surging to 337 units, significantly above the recent average of ~175. However, there is a persistent inventory accounting issue: 821 units from Periods 1, 3, and 10 are indefinitely lost but remain in the 'In-transit' ledger. To ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order, I must set the 'mu_hat' parameter (which defines the base stock level) high enough to offset these 821 phantom units plus the expected demand for the lead time (L=2) and review period (1). Demand for autumn has escalated; excluding the spike, the baseline is ~180, but accounting for the spike and seasonality, a safe forecast is ~220 units/week. Therefore, the target base stock needs to be around (1+L)*220 + 821. Calculation: 3*220 + 821 = 660 + 821 = 1481. I will set mu_hat to 1480 to force the backend to account for the lost shipments while maintaining autumn service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Autumn demand spike confirmed (P33 demand: 337 units). Phantom in-transit inventory remains 821 units. To maintain availability, mu_hat must be set to approximately (3 * Forecasted_Demand) + 821.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (Autumn), where demand has risen significantly from the summer low. Recent demand (P33 and P34) were 337 and 210 units respectively, suggesting a new peak regime. The cumulative phantom in-transit inventory remains a massive obstacle; P1 (248), P3 (204), and P10 (369) are confirmed lost, totaling 821 units that never arrived but occupy the 'pipeline_inventory' in the OR backend's logic. As of Period 35, the ledger shows 1480 units in-transit. Valid orders are P33 (210), P34 (80), plus likely P24, P26, P29, and P32 which are overdue enough to potentially be lost but haven't been 'written off' yet. The actual available pipeline is likely only the P33 and P34 orders (290 units). To force the backend to place an order when it sees 1480 units in-transit, mu_hat must be set to exceed this phantom value plus the expected demand for the lead time (L=2) and review period. Based on recent high demand, I forecast ~220 units/week. Required base stock = (1+L)*220 + Phantom (821) = 660 + 821 = 1481. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1550 to trigger a replenishment order and ensure stock availability for the Autumn peak despite the ledger error.

Carry-over insight: P35: Cumulative phantom/lost shipments (P1, P3, P10) total 821 units, causing persistent stockouts as the OR engine believes it is overstocked. Autumn demand has spiked to a mean of ~240 (P33-34 avg). Manual mu_hat inflation is required to offset the 821-unit ledger error.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019). We are in the peak autumn demand regime for denim. Demand over the last 3 periods (P33-P35) averaged 250 units/week. However, the system currently shows 0 on-hand and 1,429 units in-transit. 

Inventory Ghosting: As documented in carry-over insights, 821 units are 'phantom' in-transit (orders from P1, P3, and P10 that never arrived). The true valid pipeline consists of orders from P33 (210), P34 (80), and P35 (70), totaling 360 units. The OR engine sees 1,429 and believes it is overstocked, thus suppressing new orders.

Mathematical Strategy: To force the OR engine to place an order, we must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - In-transit' is positive. 
Target inventory level = (1+L) * Forecast + Safety Stock. With L=2, demand ~250, we need ~750 units. 
To bypass the 1,429 phantom units, we must set mu_hat to approximately (Target Inventory + 1429). 
Target mu_hat calculation: (3 periods * 250 avg) + 821 (phantom) + buffer = 1571 + 300 = ~1871. 
I will set mu_hat to 1850 and sigma_hat explicitly high to 300 to ensure the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) exceeds the ledger's 1,429 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing a seasonal autumn demand for the 'Julia RW Skinny Denim'. Current demand has stabilized at an average of ~200 units over the last 4 periods (P33-P36 avg: 218). The major constraint is a cumulative 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 821 units from lost orders in P1 (248), P3 (204), and P10 (369). The current ledger shows 1570 units in-transit; however, after subtractng the 821 lost units, the legitimate pipeline is 749 units (P34: 80, P35: skip, P36: 421, and the arrived P33/P35 amounts reconcile). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' as a deduction from the base stock calculation: Order = max(0, BaseStock - (On-hand + In-transit)). Because the backend perceives 821 units that don't exist, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure the calculated BaseStock is high enough to trigger the necessary replenishment. Target calculation for BaseStock to cover L+1 (3 periods) at 200/week is 600 units. To offset the 821-unit error, mu_hat is set to 600 + 821 = 1421. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the high volatility seen during the recent autumn demand spikes (e.g., P33 at 337 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory remains 821 units (P1, P3, P10). Autumn demand floor is approximately 180-200 units/week. Explicit mu_hat inflation of ~821 units is required to bypass the backend's deduction of lost shipments from replenishment orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a significant inventory accounting discrepancy due to 821 units from Periods 1, 3, and 10 being 'phantom' in-transit (lost but still in the ledger). The OR backend calculates orders as [Base Stock - On-hand - In-transit], so it currently sees In-transit as 1570, which includes the 821 lost units. To trigger a replenishment order that covers actual demand while neutralizing these 821 phantom units, mu_hat must be explicitly set to [(1+L) * Forecasted_Demand + 821]. Current autumn demand has stabilized at ~160 units/week. With L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~480 units). Adding the 821 phantom offset, mu_hat is set to 1301. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a high service level during this volatile autumn period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The OR backend ledger is currently reporting 1570 units in-transit. Based on the documented 'phantom' inventory of 821 units (from missing shipments P1, P3, and P10), the actual legitimate pipeline consists of 749 units (orders from P29: 19, P34: 80, P36: 421, P38: 0, plus any older stragglers). The product is in a strong autumn demand regime, with a mean demand of approximately 190 units over the last 6 periods (P33-P38). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are facing consistent stockouts because the OR engine incorrectly believes the 821 phantom units are available to cover future demand. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) window (3 periods * 190 = 570) PLUS the 821 phantom units that the engine will subtract from the order. This brings the target 'base stock' level to 1391. I will set mu_hat to 1391 and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture the increased volatility of the autumn season. Lead time remains consistent with the promised 2 periods (L=2).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical data confirms that 821 units ordered in Periods 1, 3, and 10 remain lost but are still counted in the 'In-transit' ledger (Total In-transit: 1149). The legitimate pipeline inventory is actually 328 units (1149 - 821). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 1149 from the calculated base stock, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated by the amount of the lost stock (821 units). Demand for this autumn season (September to early November) has stabilized around a mean of 190 units/week, with a standard deviation of approximately 60. To calculate the target mu_hat: [(1 + L) * average_demand] + phantom_stock. With L=2, this is (3 * 190) + 821 = 1391. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover demand while accounting for the ledger error.

Carry-over insight: P40: Legitimate pipeline inventory is 328 units; 821 units (P1, P3, P10) are permanently lost but remain in the ledger. Late autumn demand regime is stable at ~190 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The demand regime for late autumn has stabilized at approximately 190 units/week. A major operational constraint persists: 821 units of 'In-transit' inventory (from Periods 1, 3, and 10) are permanently lost but remain on the backend ledger. Total In-transit is currently 1149, meaning 821 are phantom and 328 are legitimate (though no orders were placed in P37-40, the ledger may still be catching up from P36 or prior fluctuations). The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To force the backend to place an order when it incorrectly believes we have 821 units coming, we must inflate mu_hat. Forecasted demand for the review + lead time (L+1 = 3 periods) is ~570 units (3 * 190). To ensure the 'base_stock' calculation exceeds the 'in_transit' ledger (1149) plus 'on_hand' (139), we need a base_stock > 1288. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1400. This compensates for the 821 phantom units and provides enough buffer to cover current demand of ~190/week. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual logistical performance (avg ~2 periods).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has stabilized in the late autumn at approximately 130-150 units per week, following an earlier September peak. The most critical issue remains the 821 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 10 which haven't arrived in over 30 periods and are clearly lost. Currently, the ledger shows 1261 units in-transit. Subtracting the 821 phantom units leaves a legitimate pipeline of 440 units (likely the orders from P34: 80, P35: 70, P36: 421, P41: 112, though timing varies due to lead-time instability). Since the OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', it will not place a new order if it thinks the 821 lost units are coming. To force a replenishment that covers demand for the next 3 periods (~140 * 3 = 420 units), I must set mu_hat to 'Expected Demand + Phantom Inventory'. Calculation: (140 units/week * 3 weeks) + 821 phantom units = 1241. I will use 1250 to ensure the ledger gap is bridged. Sigma_hat is set to a standard volatility for this demand level (approx 15% of demand) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Late autumn demand regime is stable at ~130-150 units/week. Phantom in-transit inventory remains 821 units (P1, P3, P10). Legitimate pipeline is ~440 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 begins with 0 on-hand inventory following a significant demand spike of 499 units in Period 42 (likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event). The in-transit ledger shows 1,261 units, but 821 of these are confirmed 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10). The legitimate pipeline is 440 units (orders from P34, P41, etc.). Historical data shows the demand regime for late autumn/early December is approximately 130-150 units, but we must account for the ledger error. The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend believes the pipeline includes the 821 lost units, it will under-order unless we inflate mu_hat. To ensure a stock position that covers a 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=3) at a mean demand of ~150, we need a target base stock of ~450 units. To achieve this through the OR engine, we set mu_hat = 450 (target) + 821 (to cancel the phantom debt) = 1271. We keep L at 2 as recent actual lead times (P36, P39) have stabilized around 3, but the 821 buffer is more critical for overcoming the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Extreme demand spike of 499 units recorded (Nov 25), consistent with major holiday retail events. Phantom in-transit remains 821 units. Normal late-year demand mean revised to ~150 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status: 18 units on-hand and 1159 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 821 units in the in-transit ledger (from P1, P3, and P10) are permanently lost shipments. The legitimate pipeline consists of 338 units (ordered P34-P43: 80+70+421+112+10, but some already arrived/resolved). Specifically, P34 (80), P35 (70), P36 (421), and P41 (112) have already arrived or were accounted for, leaving mostly recent orders (P43: 10 units) and the persistent 821-unit error. Demand in the most recent period (P43) was 94 units, down from the holiday spike (499 units). The current autumn/winter demand regime is estimated at ~150 units/week. To force the OR engine to order despite the 821-unit phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) weeks of demand plus the 821-unit deficit. Forecast (L+1=3) * 150 = 450. Adjusted mu_hat = 450 + 821 = 1271. Sigma is set based on recent variability to handle peak fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: P44: Legitimate pipeline is near zero; 821 units remain lost in ledger (P1, P3, P10). Post-holiday demand has stabilized back to ~100-150 units/week. Continued mu_hat inflation of ~821 is mandatory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has returned to a post-holiday mean of approximately 110-130 units per week. The critical issue remains the 821 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory (from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, and 10), which are still in the ledger. The current in-transit visibility shows 1253 units, but actually only 432 units (1253 - 821) are legitimate potentially arriving stock (undelivered orders from P43 and P44). To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the backend's subtraction of the 821 lost units from the target base stock. A base stock target for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at a mean of 120 units would be 360 units. Therefore, mu_hat must be at least 360 + 821 = 1181. Setting mu_hat to 1200 ensure the backend logic produces a net positive order after deducting the 1253 units it believes are in pipeline. Sigma is set to reflect moderate volatility around the 120-unit mean over the review+lead period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), the system remains under a significant inventory distortion due to 821 units of phantom 'In-transit' inventory (from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, and 10). The current ledger shows 1,390 units in-transit, but only 569 units are legitimate (P41: 112 [arrived P43], P43: 10 [arrived P45], P44: 94, P45: 147, P46: ?). Recent legitimate orders are P44 (94) and P45 (147), totaling 241 units actually in the pipeline. With a current on-hand of 0 and demand for the post-holiday period (late December) stabilizing around 125 units/week, the OR backend's internal calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) would result in zero orders because it 'sees' 1,390 units arriving. To force the necessary replenishment, mu_hat must be set to approximately ((Desired_Base_Stock) + Phantom_Inventory). Desired base stock for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at ~125 units/week is ~375. Adding 821 phantom units yields a target mu_hat of ~1196. This adjustment bypasses the ledger error to ensure actual stock reaches the warehouse.

Carry-over insight: P46: Phantom in-transit inventory remains 821 units (P1, P3, P10). Post-holiday demand (late Dec) has stabilized at ~125 units/week. Legitimate pipeline inventory is 241 units (P44, P45).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in a post-holiday demand stabilization phase for denim. Recent demand has settled around 100-125 units (P44: 121, P45: 126, P46: 98). The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' ledger, which shows 1,390 units. Based on historical data, 821 units are permanently lost (P1: 248, P3: 204, P10: 369) yet remain in the backend's pipeline calculation. Valid pipeline inventory consists of orders from P44 (94 units) and P45 (147 units), plus the P46/47 status. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1,390 in-transit units from its target base stock, it will keep ordering 0 until the on-hand gap exceeds the phantom total. To force a replenishment order that covers next periods (L+1=3) at a mean of ~120 units, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Demand_Forecast * (L+1)) + Phantom_Inventory. Calculation: (120 * 3) + 821 = 1181. Setting mu_hat to 1200 ensures the backend calculates a requirement higher than the phantom inventory, triggering a necessary order to prevent persistent stockouts.
