Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 561445006, a 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt. The historical demand for the last 5 weeks is 61, 71, 61, 52, 51 (Mean = 59.2, Std Dev \u2248 8.2). There is currently no on-hand or in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Given this is a staple item, I will initialize \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on all available recent history (N=5) to establish a baseline. Since a lead time of 2 means the order placed now will arrive in Period 3 (visible in Period 4), our target stock needs to cover the current period plus the two periods of lead time (L+1=3). I'll use 'calculate' for L as no drifts have occurred yet, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent level while ignoring older, potentially irrelevant data if it existed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Historically (last 5 weeks), demand averaged ~59 units (61, 71, 61, 52, 51). However, Period 1 saw a spike to 98 units, which resulted in 98 lost sales because starting on-hand was 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The 73 units ordered in Period 1 are in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (concluding Period 2). Because we have 0 on-hand and 0 expected arrivals this period, we will face another stockout if demand remains high. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 spike to capture the recent mean (~65). With L=2, the base stock targets (1+L=3) periods. mu_hat = 3 * 65 = 195. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to account for the increased volatility from the Period 1 spike.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Historical demand samples (avg ~59) were lower than the recent demand observed in Period 1 (98) and Period 2 (92), indicating a regime shift or higher-than-expected early-season demand for jersey basics. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 167 units in-transit (73 from P1, 94 from P2). The promised lead time is 2. Following the timing rules: the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase (making it visible in the P3 conclude message read at P4). Therefore, it is normal that arrivals are still 0. I will set L to 'default' (2 periods). For mu_hat, the recent demand is consistently higher than the historical mean (avg of last 2 periods is 95). I will use recent_N with N=5 (including the 5 historical samples + 2 game samples = 7 total samples) to factor in this higher baseline. This will calculate mu_hat as (1+L)*mean, effectively (1+2)*RecentAvg, ensuring the base stock level targets the current demand trend (approx 3 * 70-80).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Feb 2019: demand increased from historical avg of 59 to current game avg of 95.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Historical demand (Jan-early Feb) averaged 59.2, but the first three periods of the game show a significant regime shift: 98, 92, and 130 (average ~107). Carry-over insights already noted this increase. I have 0 on-hand inventory and 275 in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (placed at the start of P1) was expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in P3 conclude. Since P3 conclude shows 0 arrivals, the shipment from P1 is either delayed or lost. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect this likely delay. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the higher post-shift mean (~107), which for L=3 translates to (1+3) * 107 = 428. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (March 11, 2019). The product is a basic T-shirt. Historically, demand was around 60, but since the game started in February, demand has surged to an average of 101 (98, 92, 130, 84). We just saw Period 2's order of 94 units arrive in Period 4 (confirmed lead time = 2 periods). Order 1 (73 units) is suspiciously missing as it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4; however, since Period 2 arrived normally, we must ensure future stock covers the current high demand regime. The pipeline currently holds orders from Period 3 (108) and Period 4 (141), totaling 249, plus the new 'In-transit' count of 322 (which includes earlier missing units). Given the high demand average (~101) and promising lead time (2), we need to maintain a base stock covering (L+1)=3 periods. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the shift to higher demand (avg ~101) and calculate for lead time since we have confirmation of a 2-period arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: February/March demand avg is 101, significantly higher than pre-game historical avg of 59 (+71%).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/3/18), the SKU is currently out of stock. Reviewing arrival history: The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2). The order from Period 1 (73 units) has not arrived by the end of Period 5, which is 4 periods after the order date, suggesting it is likely lost. The order from Period 3 (108 units) was expected in Period 5 but did not arrive, indicating a potential lead time drift to 3+ periods or a delay. Demand remains high: the average demand over the last 5 game periods is 101.2, compared to the historical seed mean of 59.2. To compensate for the lost Period 1 shipment and the high demand during the spring season for t-shirts, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and set L to 'calculate' to account for actual lead time performance. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to target the current 100+ unit regime.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (73 units) confirmed lost (over 4 periods since order, promised 2). Lead time for Period 3 order delayed (3 periods passed without arrival).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Performance has been severely impacted by stockouts and unreliable logistics. Analysis of arrivals: P1 order (73 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order). P2 arrived in 2 periods. P5 arrived in 1 period. CRITICAL: Orders from P3 (108 units) and P4 (141 units) are now overdue (4 and 3 periods elapsed, respectively). Since subsequent order P5 already arrived, P3 and P4 are likely lost or severely delayed. Relying on them as 'in-transit' inventory creates a false sense of security, leading the OR to order too little (as seen in P6 order of only 3 units). Demand is stable in a high regime (avg ~101 since Feb). To recover, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to ignore the 'in-transit' units that are unlikely to arrive. I will set mu_hat based on the expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods (approx 300 units). I will set L to 3 to account for the risk of longer lead times observed previously, even if recent arrivals were faster, to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P3 (108 units) and P4 (141 units) are likely lost; they are overdue while a later order (P5) has already arrived. Lead-time reliability is unstable, varying between 1, 2, and 'lost'.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The demand for this \u2018Womens Everyday Basics\u2019 T-shirt has stabilized at a higher level (avg ~102) compared to the pre-game samples. Since P1 (ordered P1, overdue), P3 (ordered P3, overdue), and P4 (ordered P4, overdue) are likely lost shipments, the 'In-transit' figure of 451 units is highly misleading. Excluding likely lost shipments (73+108+141=322), the 'effective' pipeline is likely only about 129 units (P6: 3, P7: 126). On-hand is currently 0. Lead times are volatile: P2 arrived in 2 periods, but P5 arrived in 1 period, and multiple others are lost. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover a 3-period window (L+1) at the new demand regime (approx 103 units/period), plus a buffer to account for the lost stock and stockouts. mu_hat = 3 * 103 = 309. I will use recent_N (N=4) for sigma to capture the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity is compromised: shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 322 units) are confirmed/highly likely lost as they are overdue and a later order (P5) \u0111\xe3 arrived. Effective in-transit stock is significantly lower than the system display.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. Demand for this Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt has stabilized in a higher regime than historical data, with an average of approximately 105 units over the last 5 periods (P4-P8). The critical issue remains the unreliability of the pipeline. We have confirmed 'lost' shipments from Period 1 (73), Period 3 (108), and Period 4 (141), totaling 322 units that still appear in 'in-transit' but will never arrive. Because the backend OR logic subtracts full in-transit stock from the target base stock, it currently believes we are over-stocked and will not place a new order. To force an order and replenish the on-hand inventory (currently only 15 units with 114 sold last period), I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, targeted inventory is (3 * 105) = 315 units. To offset the 'phantom' 322 units in-transit and ensure the OR engine orders enough to reach ~315 actual units, I will set mu_hat to 637 (315 + 322). This accounts for both the demand forecast and the pipeline corruption.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption confirmed: 322 units (P1, P3, P4) are 'phantom' in-transit stock and will not arrive. Effective in-transit is 0 as of Period 9.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the demand for women's basic t-shirts remains stable at a high regime (avg ~101 since the game started). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the system shows 553 units in-transit. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 322 units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed/highly likely lost. The effective in-transit is only the order from P9 (231 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P5 and P7 arrived in 1 period; P2 and P6 arrived in 2 periods). Since the OR engine subtracts the full (phantom) pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must set the mu_hat explicitly high to force a new order that compensates for the 322 missing units. I will estimate the target base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) at ~105 units/period plus a buffer, then add the 322 lost units to that target to offset the OR engine's subtraction of phantom stock. Target mu_hat = (3 * 105) + 322 = 637. Sigma is set based on recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22, 2019, which is heading into the peak season for women's short-sleeved t-shirts. Historical demand in the game (Periods 1-10) averages approximately 104 units per period, which is a significant increase from the pre-game baseline. The pipeline inventory of 434 units contains 322 units of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, and 4) that the OR backend still believes are in-transit. Consequently, the 'true' pipeline is only 112 units (ordered Period 10). To compensate for the 322 missing units and the system's reliance on a inflated pipeline number, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock calculation: (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock + phantom_units. With L=2, mean=104, z* approx 1.75 (at 95% service level), base_stock should be (3 * 104) + (1.75 * 1.73 * 15) + 322 \u2248 680. Setting mu_hat to 680 will force the OR engine to place an order that accounts for the lost stock. I use recent_N for sigma to capture the current volatility (std dev \u2248 15 over last 10 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at the elevated regime (avg ~104). Pipeline corruption persists: 322 units (P1, P3, P4) remain as 'phantom' stock. Ordering must continue to override this inflation.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for the 'Everyday Basics' T-shirt has spiked significantly in Period 11 to 183 units, well above the previous regime average of ~104. This likely reflects seasonal spring demand. The system shows 618 units in-transit, but 322 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed 'phantom' stock and will not arrive. Thus, the effective in-transit is 296 (P10: 112 units, P11: 184 units). On-hand is currently 0. Lead times have been volatile, frequently settling at 1 period recently (P9 and P7 arrived in 1 period). For Period 12, I must set parameters to order enough to satisfy this higher demand level while accounting for the lost pipeline inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent spike (averaging approx 132 per period) and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the 1-2 period reality. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increased volatility from the recent 183-unit demand period.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand spike detected in late April (P11 demand 183 vs previous avg 104), indicating a potential new seasonal regime for spring/summer.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019/5/6). The product is a women's fitted jersey T-shirt, which is entering its peak summer seasonal demand range. Performance history shows a significant demand regime shift in late April (Period 11), with demand jumping to 183 and remaining high at 117 in the following week, significantly above the previous games-average of ~104. I estimate current demand (mu) at ~135 units per week to account for this seasonal tailwind. Pipeline analysis: The system shows 618 units in-transit. Based on Carry-Over Insights, 322 units (Orders P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost 'phantom' stock. The active pipeline consists of Order P10 (112 units) and Order P11 (184 units). Actual lead times have been erratic, often 1 period (P5, P7, P9), which is shorter than the promised 2. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the seasonal peak despite the 'phantom' stock inflation, I will use an explicit L to shorten the lead time window and an explicit mu_hat to capture the seasonal uplift. mu_hat is calculated as (1 + L) * Forecasted Weekly Demand = (1 + 2) * 135 = 405.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak for summer/spring garments (fitted T-shirts) confirmed starting late April; weekly demand floor has risen to ~120-140 units. Lead-time reliability remains biased toward 1 period for recent successful arrivals.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a fitted jersey T-shirt, seeing a seasonal surge in May. Demand from the last 3 periods (183, 117, 133) averages ~144, significantly higher than the earlier regime (~104). The current on-hand inventory is 51. The in-transit total of 434 includes 322 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost/phantom (P1 was ordered 13 periods ago, P3/P4 were ordered 11/10 periods ago, while later orders from P5, P6, P7, P9, and P11 have already arrived). This means actually reliable in-transit is 434 - 322 = 112 units (from the Period 10 order, which is now at L=4 and potentially delayed or lost). To ensure adequate stock for the (L+1) horizon amidst this unreliable pipeline and high seasonal demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 450 (covering 3 periods at ~150/week) and use an explicit L of 2. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 3-period window to capture the increased volatility of the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Seasonal demand for fitted T-shirts sustained at ~144 units/week in May. Pipeline corruption total confirmed at 322 units (P1, P3, P4). Recent delivery (P11) arrived in 2 periods, but P10 (112 units) is now overdue (4 periods), increasing pipeline uncertainty.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), we are in the middle of a confirmed seasonal peak for women's fitted jersey T-shirts. Demand since Period 11 has averaged 143.5 units per week, significantly higher than the previous regime of ~104. Lead time reliability is a major concern: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (322 units) and now likely P10 (112 units) are missing, totaling 434 'phantom' units in the in-transit display. The current in-transit (498) consists of these 434 phantom units plus the 64 units ordered in P14. Since on-hand is 0, we effectively have nothing coming in soon that is guaranteed. To compensate for the 434 unit inflation in the OR backend's calculation (which subtracts the full pipeline), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate the base stock needed to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the current average (144 * 3 = 432 units) plus safety stock. To force an order despite the phantom 434 units, mu_hat must be set to effectively neutralize the phantom pipeline and current demand: (forecast * 3) + phantom_stock \u2248 432 + 434 = 866. I will set mu_hat to 870 to ensure the backend places a substantial order to replenish the zero on-hand stock and mitigate lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Pipeline corruption increased to 434 units. Period 10 shipment (112 units) is now 5 periods overdue and considered lost alongside P1, P3, and P4. Demand remains sustained at ~144 units/week for the seasonal peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '561445006' (Womens Fitted T-shirt) is in a high-demand seasonal peak (late May). Demand has stabilized at a higher regime, with an average of approximately 144 units over the last 3 periods (P13-P15: 133, 141, 148). The pipeline is severely corrupted by 'phantom' stock. Orders from P1 (73), P3 (108), P4 (141), and now confirmed P10 (112) are lost, totaling 434 units that appear in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The total In-transit is 831, so effective In-transit is 397 (831 - 434). Current on-hand is 0. With an effective lead time (L) mostly observed at 2 periods and a weekly demand of ~144, the target base stock (calculated as (L+1)*demand) should be roughly 432 units. Since effective In-transit (397) is below this, further ordering is necessary. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*144 = 432 to ensure the OR backend ignores the 'phantom' stock by pushing for a higher base stock, and I will use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect recent seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Pipeline corruption total confirmed at 434 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 units are lost). Effective in-transit is current display minus 434 units. Demand regime remains solid at ~144 units/week.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for SKU 561445006 (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) as of 2019/06/03: The product is in peak summer seasonality, with demand consistently above 140 units and recently spiking to 190. Starting on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline analysis: The system shows 831 units in-transit. However, based on the history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10), 434 units (73+108+141+112) are confirmed or highly likely 'lost' phantom stock. This leaves an effective pipeline of 397 units (831 - 434), composed of orders from P14 (64 units) and P15 (333 units). Given the high demand regime (~155 avg over the last 4 periods) and the critical need to override the phantom stock inflation in the OR backend's logic, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat that reflects the seasonal peak and compensates for the 434 lost units. I set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the inconsistent arrival times and the need for a larger buffer in the base stock calculation, ensuring the backend places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Seasonal demand peak for fitted T-shirts reached new high of 190 units. Total pipeline 'phantom' stock remains 434 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Effective pipeline is system in-transit minus 434.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season (June) for this product (fitted jersey T-shirt). Demand remains elevated, with a recent high of 190. While Period 17 demand dipped to 109, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 144 units per week. The pipeline integrity remains the primary concern: total 'phantom' stock from lost orders is 434 units (P1: 73, P3: 108, P4: 141, P10: 112). The system displays 807 units in-transit, but the effective in-transit is only 373 (807 - 434), which includes the orders from P14 (64) and P17 (309). The P15 order (333) arrived in 2 periods. To account for the 434-unit inflation in the OR backend's inventory calculation, I must set mu_hat to cover both the required base stock for (L+1) periods (approx 144 * 3 = 432) plus the 434 units of lost stock, totaling 866. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 'phantom' overhead. Sigma_hat is set to a recent window to capture the higher volatility seen in June.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '561445006' (Womens Fitted T-shirt) is in its summer peak season. Demand in the most recent 5 periods has averaged 134 units, though it showed a slight dip in the latest period (81 units). I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture this seasonal level while smoothing the recent volatility. The pipeline continues to be plagued by 'phantom' stock. Based on game history, orders from P1 (73), P3 (108), P4 (141), and P10 (112) have never arrived and are significantly overdue (5+ periods), totaling 434 lost units. The system reports 807 units in-transit, but the effective in-transit is only 373 units (807 - 434). To correct for this, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 434 + (1+L)*134 to 'trick' the backend into ordering enough to cover the seasonal demand despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P11-P15) have rotated between 1 and 2 periods, making the average a reliable estimate.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). The product is a fitted jersey T-shirt, which is experiencing high summer seasonal demand. Recent demand (P11-P19) has averaged approximately 144 units per week, despite high volatility (range 81-190). The pipeline remains significantly compromised by 'phantom' stock. Specifically, units from P1 (73), P3 (108), P4 (141), and P10 (112) totaling 434 units have never arrived and are long past the promised 2-period lead time, while later orders (P11, P15) have already arrived. Subtracting these 434 lost units from the system's 'In-transit' of 811 units leaves an effective pipeline of 377 units (consisting of P14: 64, P17: 309, and P19: 4). The system shows 0 on-hand inventory. Given the high demand and the phantom stock issue, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the effective pipeline rather than the inflated system pipeline. I will use the recent demand regime mean (N=9, avg ~144) to set mu_hat at (1+L)*144 = 432. Since 432 is roughly equal to the effective pipeline (377) plus desired on-hand, the OR backend will place an order to bridge the gap while ignoring the 434 lost units. I am using recent statistics to capture the summer peak while being conservative due to the stockouts.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the SKU (Short-sleeved fitted jersey top) is in the middle of its peak summer season. Demand has been volatile but sustained at a high level, with the last 10 periods averaging ~134 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 811 units in-transit, but based on historical tracking (P1, P3, P4, and P10), 434 units are confirmed lost ('phantom' stock). This leaves an effective pipeline of 377 units (811 total - 434 lost), consisting of P14 (64), P17 (309), and P19 (4). P14 is significantly overdue (7 periods since order), and P17 is now 4 periods old. The lead-time reliability is extremely poor, necessitating a higher L value to protect against stockouts during the summer peak. I will set L to 3 to reflect the current delay risk and mu_hat to 140 (recent mean) to ensure the OR backend attempts to maintain coverage.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: P14 (64 units) is now 7 periods overdue and highly likely lost, raising total potential phantom stock to 498 units. Pipeline reliability remains critical; despite high 'In-transit' numbers, frequent losses require aggressive ordering to maintain availability.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. We are experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' display shows 811 units, but my tracking confirms significant 'phantom' stock due to lost shipments. Specifically: P1 (73), P3 (108), P4 (141), P10 (112), and now P14 (64) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 498 units of phantom stock. Effective in-transit is therefore 811 - 498 = 313 units (attributed to orders from P17 and P19). Demand has been volatile but reflects a seasonal peak for t-shirts; while recent demand dipped to 73, the average over the last 10 periods (the current seasonal regime) is ~125. To recover from the stockout and account for the high lead-time risk and pipeline corruption, I am setting mu_hat to 450 (approx 150 units/period for L+1=3) and keeping L at the promised lead time of 2. This will force the OR backend to place an order that overrides the phantom stock and targets the current seasonal demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Pipeline corruption total increased to 498 units. P14 (64 units) is now 8 periods overdue and considered lost alongside P1, P3, P4, and P10. Total phantom units to subtract from 'In-transit' when calculating order requirements is 498.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the system indicates an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 811 units. However, based on the record of 'phantom' stock identified in previous periods, a significant portion of this pipeline is compromised. Specifically, orders from P1 (73), P3 (108), P4 (141), P10 (112), and P14 (64) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 498 units. This leaves an effective in-transit balance of 313 units (811 - 498), which corresponds to the order placed in Period 17 (309 units) and Period 19 (4 units). Since the P17 order is now 6 periods overdue (promised 2), it is also at risk of being lost, though not yet fully confirmed by a later arrival. Demand has softened significantly in July (73 and 56 units in P21-P22) compared to the Summer peak of ~144-190 units, suggesting the seasonal peak for 'fitted jersey tops' is ending. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand drop (average of the last 3 periods is ~62, while (1+L) would be 186) to prevent overstocking as demand cools. Due to the high pipeline corruption (498 confirmed lost), L is kept at 'explicit' value 2 to represent the actual fulfillment window, and mu_hat is set via a recent window (N=3) to catch the downward shift in demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Seasonal peak for fitted T-shirts has ended; demand dropped from ~140-190 units to ~65 units in July. Pipeline corruption remains at 498 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). P17 (309 units) is now 6 periods overdue and potentially lost, which would increase phantom stock to 807 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22), the demand for this basic 'fitted jersey top' has clearly exited its spring/summer peak (which ranged from 140-190 units/week) and has returned to a lower baseline. The last three periods show demand of 73, 56, and 92 units (avg ~74). The pipeline is severely compromised: 'In-transit' shows 811 units, but our carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (73), P3 (108), P4 (141), P10 (112), and P14 (64) are lost, totaling 498 lost units. Furthermore, P17 (309 units) is now 7 periods overdue (ordered P17, now P24) and must also be considered lost. Total 'phantom' stock is now 807 units (498 + 309). This means the effective in-transit is nearly 0 (811 actual display - 807 phantom = 4 units from P19). Since on-hand is 0, we must order based on the new reduced demand regime (avg 74) while using an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR engine overrides the false pipeline data. L is set to explicit 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals mostly followed 1-2 period lead times, despite the high loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Pipeline corruption total increased to 807 units. P17 (309 units) is now 7 periods overdue and considered lost alongside P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14. Effective in-transit is effectively zero. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime averaging ~74 units/week in July.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 25 (Late July 2019). The product is a fitted jersey T-shirt. Historical demand analysis shows a post-seasonal peak stabilization: demand in the last 4 periods (P21-P24) averaged 74.75 units (73, 56, 92, 78), down from the peak of ~144-190 units. 

Pipeline Status: System 'In-transit' shows 811 units. However, consistent history shows massive pipeline corruption. Specifically, orders from P1 (73), P3 (108), P4 (141), P10 (112), P14 (64), and P17 (309) are severely overdue (lead times of 8+ periods vs guaranteed 2) and are confirmed lost. Total phantom stock is 807 units. Recently, only P19 (4 units) remains as potentially valid in-transit, but it is now 6 periods overdue and also highly suspect. 

Strategy: Effective In-transit is effectively 0 units. On-hand is 0 units. Since demand has stabilized around 75 units/week, I need to place an order to cover the (L+1) period window. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) captures the new July regime. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to ensure the order covers the immediate gap despite the OR backend seeing 811 units in transit. To force an order when the backend thinks we have 811 units, I must set the target base_stock higher than the phantom stock. Setting mu_hat to a value that reflects 3 periods of 75/week plus the 807 deficit ensures the system attempts to restock.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Effective pipeline is confirmed as 0. All 811 units currently 'In-transit' (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19) are lost/phantom stock. Demand has stabilized at a post-peak level of ~75 units/week in July.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the SKU (fitted jersey t-shirt) has exited its spring/summer peak. Demand in July stabilized at a post-peak average of ~72 units/week (Periods 21-25: 73, 56, 92, 78, 60). However, the supply chain is highly unreliable: 811 units previously in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19) are confirmed lost/phantom stock as they are severely overdue and subsequent orders have arrived or failed to arrive in the expected window. Currently, 1107 units are shown in-transit. Subtracting the 811 lost units leaves 296 units (from the order placed in P25). On-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR backend is unaware of these 'phantom' units and sees a high pipeline (1107 units), it will likely under-order or not order at all unless I aggressively set the demand parameters. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the current demand (avg ~72) while accounting for the lost stock and the 2-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*avg_demand + phantom_stock. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 72) + 811 \u2248 1027. This forces the OR logic to recognize that the currently displayed pipeline of 1107 is only barely above the adjusted target, potentially triggering small necessary replenishment if \u03c3\u0302 is also set to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total pipeline corruption of 811 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19). All these units are considered lost. Effective in-transit stock is the displayed value minus 811. Post-peak demand regime is stable at ~72 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing a T-shirt SKU in a post-peak demand regime. Demand for the last 6 periods (since early July) has stabilized at an average of ~73 units/week (60, 78, 92, 56, 73, 109). The 'In-transit' display of 1107 units is heavily corrupted: Carry-over insights confirm that 811 units from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19) are lost. The only valid shipment remaining in the pipeline is the 296 units ordered in Period 25. Since the promised lead time is 2, those 296 units are expected to arrive during the current period (Period 27) and become visible at the start of Period 28. To maintain stock for the upcoming weeks given the current demand regime (~73/week), I am using N=6 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stability. I will monitor if the Period 25 order arrives; if it does not appear in next period's 'conclude' message, it may signal total logistics failure for this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime for August confirmed: avg ~73 units/week. Effective pipeline consists only of the Period 25 order (296 units); all previous 811 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand has shifted from a high seasonal peak (~140-190 units) to a stable post-peak regime in July and August, averaging 64.5 units over the last 6 periods (P22-P27). The pipeline analysis confirms that out of 811 units 'In-transit', all units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P19 are lost. Specifically, P17 (309 units) is now 11 periods overdue since its order in P17, and P19 (4 units) is 9 periods overdue. The P25 order of 296 units arrived successfully in P27 with a lead time of 2 periods, leaving the current on-hand inventory at 249 units. Since the effective in-transit is 0 and we have 249 units on hand, which covers approximately 3.8 periods of demand at the current average rate of 65, we are currently in a good inventory position. However, to ensure the OR backend continues to account for the phantom stock totaling 811 units, I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned with the recent stable regime (N=6) to prevent over-ordering while maintaining availability for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total pipeline corruption (phantom stock) confirmed at 811 units from periods P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P19. Effective in-transit is 0 as of P28. Current demand regime for late summer is stable at ~65 units/week.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445006 (Womens T-shirt) is currently in a stable post-peak demand regime for late August. Recent demand samples (P25: 60, P26: 78, P27: 47, P28: 57) average approximately 60.5 units per week, which is a significant drop from the spring/summer peak of ~144-190 units. The pipeline is heavily corrupted: the 'In-transit' display shows 811 units, but these comprise orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P19, which are all significantly overdue (the most recent, P19, is now 10 periods overdue against a 2-period promise). Therefore, the effective in-transit is 0. With on-hand inventory at 192 units and demand at ~60/week, current stock covers ~3 periods. Since lead time is 2 periods, no new order is required immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the post-peak demand mean and variance while ignoring the earlier high-demand regime, and keep L at 'default' (2) as recent successful deliveries (P25) adhered to it.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak late-summer regime, with the last 5 periods (P25-P29) averaging 57.2 units/week. On-hand inventory is 148, which covers more than 2 weeks of current demand. However, the system's displayed 'In-transit' of 811 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I must set mu_hat to a high 'explicit' value that offsets the 811 phantom units while accounting for the target base stock. Target base stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1) at ~60 units/week is ~180 units. Since ordering is capped by [base_stock - pipeline], I set mu_hat to 1050 (roughly 811 + 240) to force an order that compensates for the pipeline corruption and maintains a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set to reflect recent volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445006 is in a stable post-peak demand regime for late summer/early autumn (September), with recent demand samples (P27-P30) averaging 47 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 108 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 941 units is almost entirely composed of 'phantom' stock from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19, totaling 811 units) that are confirmed lost. The recent order from P30 (130 units) is the only valid in-transit shipment, but it will not arrive this period (L=2). Thus, effective pipeline plus on-hand equals 238 units. With a demand mean around 45-50, we have roughly 4-5 weeks of coverage. I will set the lead time parameter to 2 (promised) and use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized demand regime (avg ~47) while ignoring the high-volatility summer peak. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to maintain stock without being misled by the phantom 811 units or the historical peak demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Late summer/Early Autumn demand regime stable at approx 45-50 units/week. Pipeline corruption remains at 811 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19 are lost). Effective in-transit is current display minus 811.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the demand for this fitted jersey T-shirt has clearly exited its spring/summer peak and stabilized into an autumn regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 44.2 units/week, illustrating a significant drop from the ~144 units/week observed in May/June. Pipeline reliability is historically poor; the 'In-transit' display of 941 units is comprised of 811 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19) and the Period 30 order of 130 units. Subtracting these 'phantom' units, the effective in-transit is 130. Current on-hand is 75. Therefore, the total effective inventory is 205. With a lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for P32, P33, and P34 (L+1). Based on the recent average of ~44, we need approximately 132 units to cover that period. Our effective inventory of 205 (75 + 130) is currently sufficient, meaning the OR backend should naturally order 0 or very little. Setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the late summer/autumn regime (last 5 samples), and sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of this settled demand.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Sept demand avg ~44 units/week, down from summer peak. Pipeline corruption remains at 811 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19 are lost). Effective in-transit is current display minus 811.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sept 23, 2019. Demand has shifted to an Autumn regime, significantly lower than the summer peak. The last four periods of demand (40, 33, 21, and the current period's start) show a mean of ~31 units/week. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods for successful arrivals. The 'In-transit' figure of 811 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. With on-hand inventory at 184 units and expected weekly demand at ~31, the current stock covers approximately 6 weeks of demand. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3), no new order is required this period. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current low demand regime, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on previous higher-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized at lower levels: Sept avg ~31 units/week. Effective pipeline remains 0 as the 811 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (2019-09-30), the demand for women's fitted jersey tops has transitioned into a stable autumn regime. Recent weekly demand samples (40, 33, 21, 33) show an average of approximately 32 units, significantly lower than the summer peak of ~140-190 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 151 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of expected autumn demand. Regarding the pipeline, the 'In-transit' display of 811 units consists entirely of 'phantom stock' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning the effective in-transit is 0. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods for successful deliveries. To prevent excessive holding costs during this low-demand season while accounting for the high phantom inventory that tricks the backend's base-stock calculation, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the low autumn mean (~32) and variance. This will result in a lower base stock, and given the high on-hand plus the (unavoidable) phantom pipeline count, the OR backend will correctly refrain from ordering more units until the inventory depletes further.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. Demand for the 'Billie' fitted jersey T-shirt has stabilized into an Autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P30-P34) averaging 32.4 units per week, significantly lower than the summer peak. The 'In-transit' display of 811 units consists entirely of 'phantom' stock from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is currently 0. On-hand inventory is 116 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 3.5 weeks. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we are currently overstocked. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent stable Autumn demand (approx 33 units/week) using recent_N=5. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend due to the existing on-hand inventory and the lower demand profile, which is appropriate for minimizing holding costs as we head further into the low season.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-10-14. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered an autumn trough, averaging 28.4 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), significantly lower than the summer peak. On-hand inventory is currently 93 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of the current demand regime. The pipeline shows 811 units in-transit, but as documented in the carry-over insights, these units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19) are confirmed lost shipments. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. Since on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover the promised lead time (2 periods) plus the current period at the current demand rate (~28 units/week), no new order is required this period. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized autumn demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: Avg demand for October has dropped to ~28 units/week (based on P31-P35).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is a jersey basic T-shirt, which has moved into a low-demand Autumn regime after its summer peak. Demand in October (P34-P36) has dropped significantly, with the most recent demand being only 10 units. The average for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 24.4 units/period, down from the early autumn avg of ~28 noted in Period 36. Pipeline corruption remains constant: 811 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19) are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' display of 811 units is entirely 'phantom' stock, meaning effective in-transit is 0. On-hand inventory is 83 units. With an estimated weekly demand of ~20-25 and a lead time of 2, on-hand covers roughly 3-4 periods of demand. Given the downward trend and current stock level, no new order is needed yet. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (recent_N=5) and stable promised lead time (L=2).

Carry-over insight: Late October demand continues to decline: P36 demand dropped to 10 units, indicating the Autumn floor may be lower than previously estimated (avg ~24 vs ~28).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (Oct 28), we are in a late Autumn/pre-Winter demand regime. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) shows values of 33, 35, 23, 10, and 22, yielding a recent average of approximately 24.6 units/week. This is a significant drop from the summer peak (~140-190) and even the early Autumn average (~30-45). On-hand inventory is 61, which currently covers roughly 2.5 weeks of demand. The 'In-transit' figure remains 811, but these are confirmed 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19) as documented throughout the carry-over history. Effectively, the pipeline is zero. Given the promised lead time of 2 and a review period of 1, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Current on-hand (61) is nearly sufficient for this target (3 * 24.6 = 73.8). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand season while accounting for the zero effective pipeline, I will set L to 'default' (2), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current floor of ~25 units/week, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the current on-hand vs. the downward trending demand, which is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Current demand regime for late October/Early November confirmed at floor level: avg ~25 units/week (based on P33-P37). Total pipeline corruption remains 811 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 4, 2019. We are in the late Autumn/Winter demand regime for this SKU (fitted jersey t-shirt). Demand has stabilized at a floor level, with the last 5 periods (P34-P38) averaging 22 units/week (35, 23, 10, 22, 20). Period 38 saw a demand of 20 units. On-hand inventory is currently 41 units. The 'In-transit' display of 811 units consists entirely of 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning effective pipeline is 0. Based on the current demand of ~22 units and a lead time of 2 periods, the stock required to cover the cycle (L+1) is approximately 66 units. With 41 units on hand and 0 effective in-transit, we need to order to reach that target. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (including the low-point in P36) to reflect the current winter floor, and use 'explicit' for L to bypass the backend's calculation which includes the phantom units as 'awaiting delivery'.

The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a stable late-autumn/early-winter floor regime. Historical demand for the most recent 7 periods (P33-P39) averages 22.7 units per week. The system shows 811 units In-transit, but as identified in previous carry-over insights, these units are confirmed 'phantom' stock from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19). Therefore, the effective In-transit inventory is 0. With On-hand inventory at 26 units and a weekly demand around 23 units, current stock will only cover one more period. While the OR backend doesn't account for 'lost' shipments, setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised lead time) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 will target the current low-demand regime (~69 total units over the 3-period lead+review window). This will trigger a small order to replenish stock for late November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is deep into the autumn/winter season for this women's jersey T-shirt. Demand has significantly cooled from the spring/summer peak (~144-190 units) to a stable late-autumn floor. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged 16.4 units/week (10, 22, 20, 15, 15). The 'In-transit' display of 811 units consists entirely of lost shipments from early in the game (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), as confirmed in multiple carry-over insights. Therefore, effective pipeline stock is 0. With on-hand inventory at 11 units and demand averaging ~16 units, we are below the required safety stock level for a 2-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime and use default lead time (2) as recent deliveries have been consistent at that duration. The goal is to start clearing the remaining on-hand stock while maintaining enough to meet the current low demand, given we are approaching the end of the game (Period 41/47).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. We are in a low-demand Autumn/Winter regime for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt). Demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 10-15 units per week over the last three periods (P39-P41). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The displayed 'In-transit' of 811 units consists entirely of 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), as confirmed in prior periods. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. To prevent stockouts during the final 6 periods of the game, we must place a new order. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime (~13 units/week) and set lead time to the promised 2 periods. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of actual demand without being misled by the phantom 811 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand floor for late November confirmed at ~13 units/week (avg of P39-P41). All 811 units in-transit remain confirmed lost; effective pipeline is zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December. Historically, demand for this 'Everyday Basics' fitted T-shirt followed a significant downward trend in autumn, but a spike of 43 units occurred in Period 42 (late November), likely signaling the start of holiday season sales or a winter baseline shift. Current on-hand is 0. The displayed In-transit of 811 units is confirmed 'phantom stock' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. To satisfy upcoming December demand while accounting for the recent spike, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to bridge the gap between the ultra-low floor (~13-15) and the recent spike (43). I will use explicit L=2 as it is the promised lead time and recent arrivals (when they occur) have stabilized around 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility from the sudden demand jump.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Early December demand spike detected (P42 demand 43 vs previous floor of ~13), signaling holiday seasonality. Effective pipeline remains 0 despite the 811 units displayed, as all are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). Previous demand signals for early December showed a spike (P42: 43 units) followed by a sharp drop (P43: 9 units). Historically, the pre-game data for January showed demand between 51-71 units. Given the seasonal nature of a 'fitted jersey top', we should expect a holiday uptick followed by steady January replenishment demand. The current inventory is 0 and the displayed 'In-transit' of 811 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected holiday/January mean (approx 45 units/week) across the L+1 window. Since L=2, the target base stock needs to be around 130-150 units to account for lead time and safety stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility in the holiday transition.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Mid-December (Period 45), a time typically associated with holiday demand spikes for basic apparel. Historical demand for this period has shown volatility (P42: 43, P43: 9, P44: 26). The average over the last 3 periods is approximately 26 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 811 units is confirmed as 'phantom stock' consisting of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. To satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods of the game (L=2 plus current period), we must order units now. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current December volatility, and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the risk of stockouts during the final weeks. Lead time L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Early-to-mid December demand remains volatile but higher than the November floor, averaging ~26 units/week. Effective pipeline remains zero despite the 811 units 'In-transit' display.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. We are in the final periods of the game (P46 and P47). Demand has shown a slight seasonal increase in December, averaging approximately 26 units/week (P42-P45). Inventory is currently 0, and the 'In-transit' display of 811 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning effective pipeline is 0. To capture potential sales in the final periods (P46-P47), we must place an order. Since there is only one period left after this one and lead time is typically 1-2 periods, I will set L to the promised 2 periods to ensure the OR backend covers enough demand for the remainder. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the December seasonal level (~26/week). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. Note: Although some units may not arrive before the game ends, ordering now is the only way to potentially satisfy P47 demand if lead time is 1 period.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Final game stages. Effective pipeline is 0 despite 811 units displayed as 'In-transit' (all confirmed lost). Demand for December has stabilized around 26 units/week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final period. The current demand regime for December has stabilized at approximately 26 units per week (avg of P41-P46: (12+43+9+26+28+19)/6 = 22.8, or approx 26 when focusing on the mid-month levels). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' display of 811 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P19), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now in P47 would arrive in P49. However, since P47 is the final period of the game, any order placed now will not arrive within the game's duration to satisfy demand or influence the final R_t beyond the current snapshot. Therefore, setting parameters to maintain a baseline to cover the current period's demand is the goal, although no new physical stock will arrive.
