Demand history shows a mean of 59.2 units per period with a slight downward trend in the last two weeks (52, 51). The OR recommendation is 73 units, calculated using the promised lead time (L=2) and a critical fractile strategy to maximize profit ($19 vs $1 holding cost). Given on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish a pipeline. The lead time is 2, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive in Period 3 to satisfy Period 3 demand. We also need to account for demand in P1 and P2 while we wait. However, since we start at 0, we are guaranteed to stock out for P1 and P2 regardless of our order. The OR recommendation of 73 targets a base stock level to cover the lead time + review period. I will slightly increase this to 75 units to provide a small buffer for this everyday staple item, as initial stockouts are unavoidable and we want to ensure availability once the shipment arrives.",

The order placed in Period 1 (75 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in Period 4's decision phase. No lead-time drift or shipment loss can be confirmed yet. 2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (61, 71, 61, 52, 51) show a mean of 59.2. However, Period 1 demand was 98, suggesting a significant spike. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', and the date is mid-February. This period coincides with the transition toward spring fashion, explaining the demand increase. We currently have 0 on-hand and 75 in-transit. 3. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 95 units is based on the full historical average plus the Period 1 spike. Given that we are out of stock and demand is trending upward (98 vs historical avg ~60), we need to build inventory to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods of demand). Total demand for 3 periods at the new rate is approximately 294 units. We have 75 in-transit. An order of 95 (OR recommendation) plus the 75 in-transit (Total 170) is insufficient for 3 periods of demand if the 98/week rate holds.

Demand Analysis: Historical samples (Jan) averaged 59.2 units/week. Since the game started in Feb, demand has spiked to 98 (P1) and 92 (P2), an average of 95. This is a significant regime shift (+60%) likely due to the product being a 'Womens Everyday Basic' T-shirt transitioning toward spring. 4. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 92 units based on historical data and a target pipeline. 5. Strategy: We need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Expected demand is ~95 units * 3 = 285 units. Current pipeline is 170. Gap = 115 units. The OR recommendation of 92 units is slightly conservative given the recent demand surge.

However, in Periods 1-3, demand has surged significantly (98, 92, 130), averaging 106.6 units. This suggests a transition from winter to spring demand or a seasonal shift not captured in the 5 samples. Lead-time analysis: Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (75 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed. Performance: Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have missed 320 units of demand. Total in-transit is 285 (Orders from P1, P2, P3). Decision: OR recommends 25 units based on a base-stock policy that assumes a lead time of 2 and likely uses the lower historical average. I will override this significantly. Since the pipeline (285) is roughly 2.6 periods of current demand (107/week) and the lead time is longer than promised, I need to protect against a continued stockout.

The product is a women's t-shirt (Everyday Basics), which has steady demand but may see a slight seasonal lift as we move into spring (March). \n3. Inventory Status: Current on-hand is 11. In-transit consists of orders from P3 (115) and P4 (125), totaling 240 units (excluding the lost P1 units). \n4. Strategy adjustment: The OR recommends 0 units because its pipeline inventory (315) is high, likely still counting the lost P1 order. After adjusting for the lost 75 units, the true pipeline is 240. Given current demand (~85/period) and a 2-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Periods 5, 6, and 7 (approx 255 units total).

Total in-transit is 400 (Orders from P3: 115, P4: 125, P5: 85, plus the lost P1: 75).

The product is a 'Women's Everyday Basic T-shirt'. As we move into late March, demand is likely to remain stable or slightly increase with Spring. \n4. **OR Recommendation**: OR recommends 0 because it sees 400 in-transit against its internal base-stock target. However, it doesn't account for the lost P1 order or the potential delay/loss of P3. \n5. **Adjustment**: Current coverage needs to account for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~255 units).

Recent demand is stable around this higher regime. 3. Safety/Inventory Check: Current stock position (211) covers approximately 2 periods of demand (211 / 106 \u2248 1.99 periods). Since L=2, we need to cover L+1 = 3 periods to prevent stockouts, requiring ~318 units. 4. OR Comparison: OR recommends 0 because it includes the lost P1 and P3 units in its inventory calculation.

This corresponds with May (Period 13, May 6th), which is peak season for short-sleeved basic jersey tops as temperatures rise. I expect demand to remain in the 120-180 range. \n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 645 units. However, we have a significant reliability issue. Historically, orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and likely 11/12 are either lost or heavily delayed. Specifically, the P10 order (100 units) should have arrived by now (L=2) but hasn't concluded. The 645 units 'in-transit' is misleading because it includes P1 (75), P3 (115), and P4 (125) which are confirmed lost, totaling 315 ghost units. The 'real' pipeline is roughly 330 units (from P10, P11, P12). \n3. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 645 units in-transit against its internal base stock. Since nearly 50% of the recorded pipeline is physically lost and current on-hand is zero, we are facing imminent stockouts during a peak demand month. \n4. **Strategy**: To cover 3 periods (L+1) at a seasonal demand of ~150 units/period, we need roughly 450 units of real pipeline.

However, based on the historical loss rate (~40%), many of these are likely lost. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and possibly P15 (yet to conclude) contribute to this volume.

Currently, we have an on-hand inventory of 226 units following the arrival of P15 (185) and P16 (150) orders in Period 17 (totaling 335 units). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 850 units includes several orders that are highly likely lost based on historical performance: P10 (100), P12 (130), P13 (120), and P14 (135) totaled 485 units that have exceeded the L+2 observation window without arriving. The 'active' pipeline likely only consists of Period 17's order (180 units) and today's order. 2. **Demand Analysis**: We are in mid-June (2019/6/10), which is peak season for 'Short-sleeved, fitted jersey tops'. The average demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 144 units. While Period 17 saw a dip to 109, the preceding weeks (183, 117, 133, 141, 148, 190) suggest a much higher floor. 3. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR agent recommends 0 units because it counts the entire 850 units in-transit as valid inventory, completely ignoring the ~40-50% loss rate observed in the history. 4. **Strategy**: With 226 on-hand, we can cover Period 18 and likely Period 19. However, to maintain availability for Period 20 (when today's order should arrive) and account for the high probability of shipment loss, we must place a substantial order. Given a target stock level for 3 periods (150 units/period * 3 = 450) and subtracting the 'real' pipeline (On-hand 226 + P17 180 = 406), we need to order.

Consequently, the system-reported 'In-transit' figure of 1120 is highly inflated by 'ghost inventory'. Subtracting these 980 lost units leaves a realistic pipeline of only 140 units (P23 order of 120 units + any leftovers). Current on-hand inventory is 227 units. Total 'realizable' inventory is therefore approximately 367 units (227 on-hand + 140 in-transit). The OR recommendation is 0 because it treats the full 1120 in-transit units as valid.

With the current date of 2019/8/5, we are in late summer; demand is expected to remain stable or slightly decrease before the fall season. \n4. **Strategy**: Target inventory for (L+1) = 3 periods is ~220 units (3 * 73).

While this technically covers the requirement, I will place a small order of 30 units to ensure continuity into the final periods of the game, anticipating that late November/December demand for basic layering pieces (jersey tops) may see a minor floor or slight uptick compared to the October lows.",

To cover the promised lead time of 2 periods plus one review period (total 3 periods) at a conservative late-season demand of ~35 units/period, we need a pipeline of ~105 units. Currently, the only viable units in the pipeline are from P41 (30 units) and P42 (30 units), totaling 60 units.

The lead time is averaging 2 periods. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at an expected demand of ~25 units per period, I need a total stock/pipeline of ~75 units. Current operational pipeline (P42, P43, P44) is 115 units. P42 (30 units) is expected to arrive this period (P45), and P43 (45 units) next period (P46).

The supply chain remains moderately unstable but drastically improved compared to the early-year mass losses. 2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: Current on-hand is 47 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,280 is heavily inflated by approximately 1,170 'ghost' units from Periods 1-17 that were confirmed lost. Thus, the real operational pipeline consists only of orders from Period 44 (40 units) and Period 45 (40 units), totaling 80 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Current demand is in a low-season 'Everyday Basics' regime, averaging ~20-30 units per period (P33-P45 average is ~22). However, Period 42 showed a spike to 43. 4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 1,280 In-transit units. To maintain a safety stock for the next 3 weeks (current period + lead time), we need approximately 80-100 units (30 units/week * 3 weeks + safety). My current total viable stock (47 on hand + 80 real in-transit) is 127 units. This covers the expected demand for the next 4 periods. 5. **Decision**: Since we are near the end of the game (Period 46 of 47), and the current inventory/real pipeline (127 units) sufficiently covers the remaining duration at the current demand rate (~20-30/week), no additional order is required.
