Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has shown a significant upward trend over the last 5 weeks: 53, 132, 222, 242, 233. The average demand across all samples is approximately 176, but the last three weeks have stabilized at a higher level (average ~232). Given the nature of 'Everyday Basics' and the onset of February heading into spring, this trend is likely to stay or grow slightly. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since there are no observed arrivals yet, I'll use the default promised lead time (L=2). This approach ensures we calculate a base stock level (for L+1 = 3 periods) that covers the current high-demand level (~232 units/period) while accounting for the recent volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, a basic garment. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 53, 132, 222, 242, 233, and mostRecently 267 (captured in Period 1 conclude). The demand has stabilized around 230-270 over the last 4 periods (late Jan to mid-Feb). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed in P1) has not arrived yet due to the promised lead time of 2 periods. We expect it to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the current stable demand level (~244 units/period), as the initial low samples from early January are no longer relevant. L is kept at default (2 periods), and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the recent variability (~18 units/period).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We have seen a significant jump in demand starting in Period 1 (Feb 11th - 267 units) and Period 2 (Feb 18th - 354 units) compared to the Jan/Early Feb historical average of ~160. This product is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', and the end of February often marks the start of the spring/summer apparel ramp-up. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 522 units in transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, the P1 order (249 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and the P2 order (273 units) during P4. To prevent further stockouts as we enter the spring season, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 2 samples (P1 and P2) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~310). L is set to 'default' (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Average demand increased from ~164 to ~310 (+89%) as spring season begins for lightweight apparel.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory, but 934 units are in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) should arrive DURING Period 3 and be confirmed in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or that the first shipment is delayed. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, and demand has surged since mid-February (Avg ~299 over the last 3 weeks: 267, 354, 277) compared to the January average (~164). Given the stockout and the apparent lead-time extension, I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the delay (setting it to 3) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the higher spring demand regime while avoiding the stockout-suppressed January data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time potential shift: First order (P1) did not arrive by P3 conclude despite L=2 promise, suggesting actual lead time is \u2265 3 periods or shipment is delayed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $557.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, entering the spring season (March). Demand history shows a shift around mid-February: Pre-shift mean (Jan) was ~164, while post-shift (Feb 11 - Mar 4) mean is ~266. The most recent demand (P4: 166) was significantly lower than the preceding three weeks (267, 354, 277), which might be a temporary dip or a stabilization; I will use recent_N=4 to capture this active regime while acknowledging the spike. Regarding lead time: Period 1's order (placed P1) has not arrived as of P4 conclude (L=3+), while Period 2's order arrived exactly on time (L=2) at P4 conclude. This suggests the P1 shipment is likely lost or significantly delayed, but the link is still functional for newer orders. I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the risk of the longer observed cycle for P1 and to ensure the base stock covers a wider window, guarding against the current inventory gap (on-hand is low at 107). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 4 periods (post-shift) to stay responsive to the spring demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time inconsistency: P2 order arrived in 2 periods, but P1 order is missing as of P4 conclude (5 weeks since order), suggesting a lost shipment for P1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18. Looking at the history, the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt' which has seen demand fluctuations. Demand averaged ~300 in the first three periods of the game but dropped to ~168 in the last two periods (P4 and P5). Since the pre-game data for Feb was high (233), the recent drop might be temporary or a stabilization. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the average of this transition (~247 per period). Regarding lead time: P2 order arrived in 2 periods, but P1 order (249 units) is now 5 periods overdue, confirming it is lost. P3 (412 units) was ordered with L=2 and should have arrived in P5 (visible in P6), but P5 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests lead time is at least 3 periods or P3 is also delayed. I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the consistent delay/instability and to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to perceived pipeline safety. sigma_hat will use the last 5 periods to capture the volatility of the demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability: P3 order (ordered P3, due P5) failed to arrive by P5 conclude, following the lost P1 shipment. Evidence confirms L is effectively 3+ periods or logistics are unreliable.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. The product is a lightweight T-shirt, entering its peak spring season. Historical demand shows a significant shift starting Period 2 (Avg ~249 over the last 5 periods: 354, 277, 166, 170, 310). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 1039 units in-transit. Lead time is highly unstable: P1 (ordered P1) is missing/lost after 6 weeks; P2 took 2 periods; P3 (ordered P3, due P5) is missing after 4 weeks; P4 (ordered P4, due P6) is missing. Surprisingly, P5 arrived in just 1 period. Given the missing P1, P3, and P4 orders, I suspect logistics are either losing shipments or experiencing significant delays (L effectively > 2). I am setting L to 3 to increase the base stock level and buffer against these unreliable arrivals. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (capturing the spring season shift) and sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reliability is critically low: Orders P1, P3, and P4 are currently missing/overdue, while P2 (L=2) and P5 (L=1) arrived. This erratic behavior necessitates a higher L estimate (3) for safety.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The SKU 'Tilly' (lightweight jersey T-shirt) is entering high spring demand with current historical samples showing significant mean shifts. Looking at arrivals: P2 arrived in 2 periods (P4), P5 arrived in 1 period (P6). However, orders P1, P3, P4, and P6 have failed to conclude despite promised lead time L=2. While P1 is likely lost (now 7 periods late), P3, P4, and P6 are overdue, indicating either extreme lead time volatility or significant logistics failures. Given this unreliability, I've set L=3 via the explicit method to force the OR backend to account for more periods of safety stock in the pipeline. Current demand remains in the higher regime (~250-310 units/week); I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility compared to the initial sample set. On-hand is currently 0, so we are relying entirely on the in-transit pipeline (1164 units) to cover demand once shipments resume concluding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in its peak spring season. Historical demand since the regime shift starting P3 (Feb 25) shows an average of ~238 units per week (277, 166, 170, 310, 256, 204). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after selling out the small arrivals in Period 8. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 1005, which includes orders from P1 (249 - likely lost), P3 (412 - likely lost), P4 (344 - significantly overdue), and P8 (0). The actual lead time has been highly unstable: P2 took 2 periods, P5 took 1, P6 took 2, P7 took 1, while P1, P3, and P4 haven't arrived at all. Given the massive 'in-transit' volume (1005) against a weekly demand of ~240, and the high probability that P1 and P3 are lost, I will set L to 3 to account for the unreliability and use recent_N (N=6) for demand to capture the spring regime. Setting L to 3 and N to 6 provides a base stock covering four weeks (L+1) of demand (~960 units). Since pipeline (1005) is technically > 960, the OR backend will order 0 or very little unless I signal the lost shipments. However, 'in-transit' includes the problematic orders. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to influence the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lost Inventory Reconfirmation: Orders from Period 1 (249 units) and Period 3 (412 units) are now 8 and 6 periods overdue respectively, confirming they are lost shipments. Total lost volume is 661 units. These units remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to under-order.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/15. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 4 periods has averaged 209.75, showing a cooling down from the initial spring surge. The critical issue remains the massive 'In-transit' phantom inventory of 1023 units. Based on history, orders from P1 (249 units), P3 (412 units), and P4 (344 units) are definitively lost (P1 is 9 periods overdue, P3 is 7 periods, P4 is 6 periods). This totals 1005 'lost' units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as available pipeline inventory. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', it will not order anything until these phantom units are offset. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat (the target stock level) to at least 1005 plus the expected demand for the lead time (L+1 periods). With L=2 and average demand ~210, expected demand is ~630. Total target mu_hat = 1005 + 630 = 1635. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P5, P6, P7) had lead times of 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the supply chain volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost Shipment Update: Order from Period 4 (344 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, joining P1 and P3. Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 1005 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a consistent demand regime roughly between 170-300 units. The critical issue is 'Phantom Inventory'. The 'In-transit' count of 1693 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from Periods 1 (249 units), 3 (412 units), and 4 (344 units), totaling 1005 'phantom' units. The OR backend interprets these as arriving eventually and therefore under-orders. To secure stock for upcoming weeks, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to force an order that compensates for this 1005-unit deficit. Calculation: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 229.8 units. With L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (~690 units). However, the backend subtracts the pipeline (1693). To make the backend order approximately 700 units (to replenish on-hand and current pipeline), I need a base_stock of roughly 1693 + 700 = 2393. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to achieve this, setting L to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P9) show 1-2 period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Phantom Inventory Update: Total confirmed lost shipments are 1005 units (P1, P3, P4). The 'In-transit' value of 1693 contains only 688 units (from P10) that are expected to arrive. Logistics have stabilized to L=1 or 2 in recent periods (P9 arrived in 1, P7 in 1, P6 in 2).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The critical issue is 'phantom inventory': the 'In-transit' value of 2472 units includes several lost shipments (P1: 249, P3: 412, P4: 344) totaling 1005 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the target base stock, it consistently under-orders. We must use the 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 1005-unit deficit. Calculation: Recent demand average is ~240 (last 5 periods). With L=2, the base requirement is (1+2)*240 = 720 units. To clear the phantom inventory, we add 1005 to this target, leading to an explicit mu_hat of 1725. Lead time has recently stabilized between 1-2 periods (P9 arrived in 1, P6 in 2), so L=2 is maintained to be safe. Demand remains stable for spring jersey basics.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) total confirmed at 1005 units (P1, P3, P4). This volume must be added to mu_hat via explicit method to force the OR backend to place orders, as it incorrectly assumes these units will arrive.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6 (Period 13). The SKU is a lightweight 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which has maintained a stable demand regime since mid-February, averaging approximately 240 units per period (last 10 periods mean: 241, last 3 periods mean: 258). The logistical situation is severely compromised: total 'In-transit' is 2472 units, but detailed analysis of 'Game History' reveals that orders from Period 1 (249), Period 3 (412), Period 4 (344), Period 10 (688), and Period 11 (779) haven't arrived. Historically, orders P1, P3, and P4 are long-past 'lost'. P10 and P11 are currently overdue (observed actual lead times are ~1-2 periods recently). We have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts for several weeks. To force the OR backend into action, I must use 'explicit' values. I will estimate total demand for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) as ~750. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 2472 'In-transit' units from its target inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets this phantom inventory plus the current demand needs: 750 (demand) + 2472 (phantom inflation) = 3222. This will ensure an order is triggered despite the false pipeline visibility.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost/critically delayed shipments) has increased to 2472 units (Total In-Transit). Specifically: P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), P10 (688), and P11 (779) are all missing/overdue. mu_hat must be set as Target_Inventory + Phantom_Volume to bypass the backend's subtraction of these undeliverable units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 611 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline is reported as 2524 units, but historical analysis confirms a massive 'phantom inventory' problem where multiple shipments are lost or critically overdue. Confirmed lost/missing: P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), and P10 (688) are all significantly past their expected arrival dates. P11 (779) arrived in P13 (lead time 2). P12 ordered 0. P13 ordered 831. Total phantom units = 249+412+344+688 = 1693 units. The actual active pipeline is only the P13 order of 831 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 2524 from its target, which would result in 0 units being ordered (831 - 2524 < 0). To bypass this and ensure we order enough for the current demand regime (~250 units/period), I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Demand_Estimate + Phantom_Inventory. With L=2, Demand=250, and Phantom=1693, the target is (3 * 250) + 1693 = 2443. I will set mu_hat to 2443 to force the backend to account for the lost stock. I am keeping L=2 as it is the most consistent recently observed successful lead time (P11 took 2, P6 took 2).

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated: 1693 units are confirmed lost/missing (P1, P3, P4, P10). P11 successfully arrived in Period 13 with L=2. The OR backend must be overriden via explicit mu_hat to ignore the 1693 phantom units in 'In-transit'.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', currently in peak spring/summer season. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 220 units per week over the last 10 periods. The primary operational challenge is 'phantom inventory'. Total In-transit is 2524 units, but significant portions are confirmed lost: P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), and now P10 (688) as it is 5 periods overdue. P11 arrived with L=2, and P13 (831 units) is expected soon. Total lost units = 249+412+344+688 = 1693 units. The OR backend subtracts all In-transit units (2524) from the target base stock, but 1693 of those will never arrive. To compensate, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that adds the phantom inventory to the desired pipeline. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean = 3 * 220 = 660. To force an order despite the 2524 units the backend 'sees', I setting mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 660 + 1693 = 2353. This ensures the backend calculates (2353 - 2524 + 450) and triggers replenishment or maintains safety levels, preventing stockouts as peak season continues.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated: 1693 units are confirmed lost/missing (P1, P3, P4, P10). P13 order (831 units) is the only reliable large shipment remaining in transit (ordered P13, expected P15/P16).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a demand regime averaging ~210 units/period (last 5 periods: 291, 278, 168, 161, 241). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2524 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014lost shipments that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive. Based on historical data, confirmed lost shipments are P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), and P10 (688), totaling 1693 units. The remaining 831 units in-transit are from P13 (ordered 3 periods ago). Assuming a lead time (L) of 2, the P13 shipment should arrive in Period 16 conclude. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = mu_hat(210 * (1+2)) + safety_stock (~300) = ~930 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 2524 in-transit units, mu_hat must be set to 'Target_Base_Stock + Phantom_Inventory'. Thus, mu_hat = 930 + 1693 = 2623. This ensures the backend calculates (2623 - 2524) to place an order of roughly 100 units to maintain service levels in June.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost/critically delayed shipments) remains at 1693 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). These units must be offset in the mu_hat calculation to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is facing a critical stockout (On-hand: 0) while having a massive 'In-transit' figure (2524 units). Historical analysis confirms that 1,693 of these units (from P1, P3, P4, and P10) are 'phantom inventory'\u2014lost shipments that will never arrive. The remaining 831 units from P13 are due (lead time L=2 observed for P11, suggesting potentially L=2 or 3). Demand remains steady, averaging ~208 units over the last 10 periods. To force the OR backend to order, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory Calculation: Base stock target = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2 and mean=208, target \u2248 624 + safety units. However, because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (2524), and only 831 are 'real', I must add the 1,693 phantom units back. Required mu_hat = (Target Inventory) + (Phantom Inventory). Target Inventory \u2248 800 (to cover lead time and safety). 800 + 1693 = 2493. I will set mu_hat to 2550 to ensure the policy triggers an order despite the phantom volume and the 831 units currently in transit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this summer t-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) has been consistent, averaging approximately 228 units per week over the last 10 periods. The primary challenge remains 'phantom inventory'. The current In-transit total of 2618 units is misleadingly high because it includes several lost shipments: P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), and P10 (688), totaling 1693 lost units. Additionally, the P13 order (831 units) is now at Period 18 and has not arrived; usually, L=1 or 2, so P13 (ordered Period 13, expected Period 15/16) is now 2-3 periods overdue. If P13 is also lost, the phantom inventory rises to 2524. Currently, 2618 (In-transit) - 1693 (Confirmed Lost) = 925 units in transit that might still arrive (P13: 831, P17: 94). The OR backend's logic is `order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)`. With in_transit at 2618, the backend will order nothing unless mu_hat is set to at least the sum of the desired base stock and the phantom inventory. Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods is ~685 units. Including the 1693 confirmed lost units, mu_hat must be at least 2378. Given the critical stockout, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 2500 to force an order and set L to 2 to maintain the appropriate coverage horizon.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains a significant distorter of the order logic. Confirmed lost units: P1, P3, P4, P10 total 1693 units. P13 (831 units) is now highly suspect as it is 3 periods late (Promised L=2). If P13 is lost, phantom total is 2524.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has stabilized since the spring peak, with recent demand averaging ~204 units over the last 5 periods (P14-P18). Logistics remain highly unreliable. The 'In-transit' quantity of 2618 is heavily inflated by phantom/lost inventory. Specifically, orders from P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), P10 (688), and now P13 (831) are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and are likely lost. The total phantom inventory is approximately 2524 units. The only reliable units likely to arrive are the 94 units ordered in P17 (expected in P19/P20). Since on-hand is 0 and the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, it will not order anything unless we override mu_hat. To ensure a fresh order is placed, I am setting L=2 and calculating mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 200 = 600 units. To offset the 2618 phantom units and force an order for the expected demand, mu_hat is set to 3218 (600 target + 2618 phantom). This allows the OR backend's logic [Order = Base_Stock - In_Transit] to result in a positive order approximately equal to the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost/critically delayed shipments) has increased to 2524 units as of Period 19. Shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 are confirmed lost or severely overdue. This phantom volume must continue to be added back to mu_hat to bypass OR backend logic until arrivals occur.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently entering late June. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 190 units over the last 7 weeks (since P13). The primary challenge is the significant volume of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived, yet still appear in 'In-transit', preventing the OR backend from placing new orders. Confirmed lost shipments include P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), P10 (688), and P13 (831), totaling 2,524 phantom units. With current In-transit at 3,273, only 749 units (from P17 and P19) are potentially real. To force the backend to ignore these 2,524 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + z * sigma. With L=2, mean=190, and z=0.84 (for 80% service level), base stock is ~730. Adding the phantom volume (2,524) gives a required mu_hat of ~3,254. Setting L to 2 periods as recent arrivals (P11) occurred within that timeframe, though reliability remains very poor.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost/critically delayed shipments) remains constant at 2524 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). This total must be added to mu_hat to ensure the OR backend ignores these units when calculating new orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 is currently facing a massive inventory distortion due to lost or critically delayed shipments. As of Period 21, the 'In-transit' value is 3306 units, but history confirms that orders from Periods 1 (249), 3 (412), 4 (344), 10 (688), and 13 (831) are lost or severely overdue, totaling 2524 'phantom units'. These units will likely never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock. To compensate, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to include this phantom volume in the target inventory. Demand has cooled down from the spring peak, averaging 171 units over the last 5 periods (P16-P20). With a promised L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (approx 513 units) plus the phantom volume (2524 units) to trigger an order that reflects actual need. Target mu_hat = 3037. I set L=2 and sigma_hat using the recent 5-period volatility to ensure the backend uses realistic variance for the safety stock component.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 (Women's Lightweight T-shirt) is currently in a zero on-hand inventory state with zero sales for the last 5 periods due to logistics failures. The 'In-transit' figure of 3306 units is heavily distorted by phantom inventory (lost shipments). Confirmed lost shipments include P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), P10 (688), and P13 (831) totaling 2524 units. These units are significantly past any reasonable lead time and will not arrive. In-transit also includes more recent orders: P17 (94), P19 (655), and P20 (33), totaling 782 units. Current demand has stabilized at a lower summer level, averaging ~152 units over the last 3 samples. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat (the safety stock target) to cover the lost volume (2524) plus the required target for the next 3 periods (L=2, thus 3 periods of demand). Target demand = 3 * 152 = 456. Total mu_hat = 456 + 2524 = 2980. This explicit override ensures the backend's subtraction of the 2524 phantom units results in an actual order that covers current demand needs.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost/critically delayed shipments) remains constant at 2524 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Logistics stability is currently unobservable due to lack of arrivals, but recent order volume from P19 (655 units) is the next critical test for the supply chain.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to struggle with 'phantom inventory'. As of Period 23, the total 'In-transit' value is 3273 units. Crucially, 2524 of these units are confirmed lost or severely overdue (P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13). There is also uncertainty regarding the P17 order (94 units) and P19 order (655 units), though the P20 order (33 units) successfully arrived in Period 22 with L=2. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these 2524 missing units as incoming stock and consequently under-ordering, I must add this phantom volume to the expected demand across the lead time (mu_hat). Demand has stabilized recently, averaging approximately 144 units over the last 4 periods (P19-P22). Using a 3-period lead time estimation (L+1=4) for conservative safety, the expected demand is ~576 units. Adding the 2524 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 3100. Sigma_hat is set using recent history (N=10) to reflect current volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a core summer staple. We are currently in late July (2019-07-22), where demand has naturally tapered from the spring peak (~300 units) to a stable summer range (~110-140 units). Recent demand samples (P21-P23) are 143, 129, and 106 respectively, averaging 126 units/period. The primary challenge remains the systemic loss of inventory in the supply chain. Confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) includes: P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), P10 (688), and P13 (831), totaling 2524 units. Additionally, the shipment from P17 (94 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be added to the phantom total, bringing it to 2618. Although the P20 order arrived correctly (L=2), the massive volume of In-transit units (3273) consists almost entirely of these phantom units. To force the OR backend into ordering, I must add this phantom volume to the base stock calculation using the explicit mu_hat method. Target base stock = (1+L)*E[D] + Phantom Volume. Using L=2 and E[D]=130, target is (3 * 130) + 2618 = 3008.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Phantom inventory total increased to 2618 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17). These units remain in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost or critically overdue, requiring manual offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (Late July), demand is clearly in a downward seasonal trend for this t-shirt SKU, with the last four periods averaging 112 units (152, 143, 129, 106, 70). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The primary challenge remains 'phantom inventory' in the In-transit pipeline. Analysis of undelivered orders confirms that P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17 are now significantly past their lead times and likely lost. Total phantom units = 249 (P1) + 412 (P3) + 344 (P4) + 688 (P10) + 831 (P13) + 94 (P17) = 2618 units. The current 'In-transit' visible to the backend is 3273 units, meaning only 655 units (from P19) are potentially real. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' to (Target_Inventory + 2618). A target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand at current levels (~120/week) is approx 360-400 units. Adding the phantom offset: 400 + 2618 = 3018. I will set mu_hat to 3000 to trigger a small replenishment order while logistics stabilize, choosing 'explicit' to bypass the backend's subtraction of the 2618 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total increased to 2618 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17). These units remain in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost or critically overdue, requiring manual offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a clear seasonal decline typical of lightweight t-shirts as summer winds down, with demand dropping from a peak of ~300 to current levels around 50-100 units. The critical operational issue remains 'phantom inventory'. Total In-transit is 3273 units. Based on historical data, the following shipments are confirmed lost or critically overdue: P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), P10 (688), P13 (831), and P17 (94), totaling 2618 phantom units. Additionally, the shipment from P19 (655 units) is now 6 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost. This brings total phantom inventory to 3273 units, matching the total 'In-transit' value. Consequently, the OR backend assumes we have 3273 units coming, when in reality we have 0 reliable units in transit. To bypass the backend's subtraction of this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Target base stock for L=2 and mean demand of ~60 is roughly 250 units. Therefore, 250 + 3273 \u2248 3523. This forces an order to cover current demand despite the phantom backlog.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total increased to 3273 units as of Period 26 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19 are all lost/critically overdue). The entire 'In-Transit' balance is currently composed of lost units, requiring a full offset in mu_hat calculations to trigger new replenishment.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a seasonal summer/everyday basic item. Demand has steadily declined from ~200+ units in the spring/early summer to 35 units in late summer/early August (Period 26), signaling the end of the seasonal peak. However, the operational challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the In-transit balance. Total In-transit is 3580 units, but historical evidence confirms most of these are lost: P1(249), P3(412), P4(344), P10(688), P13(831), P17(94), and P19(655) are significantly overdue. Summing these lost shipments equals 3273 units. The remaining 307 units (from Period 26) are expected to arrive in Period 28/29. The current demand regime (recent 3 periods) averages ~52 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 3580 phantom units, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Anticipated demand for L+1 periods (L=2) is roughly 3 periods * 50 units = 150 units. Base stock target would be approx 250 units (including safety stock). To override the 3580 phantom units which the backend subtracts, I set mu_hat = 3580 + 250 = 3830. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the 'In-transit' phantom volume.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated: 3273 units are confirmed lost/missing (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). The only 'active' reliable shipment is the 307 units ordered in P26. Demand for this summer staple is entering a post-seasonal low, averaging ~50 units/week.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is a summer staple currently entering a post-seasonal demand trough (averaging ~37 units/week over the last 2 weeks). Supply chain reliability remains catastrophic. Current In-transit is 3887 units, but the vast majority is 'phantom inventory' (lost or critically overdue). Specifically: P1 (249), P3 (412), P4 (344), P10 (688), P13 (831), P17 (94), and P19 (655) are all confirmed lost or overdue by 6+ periods beyond promised lead time, totaling 3273 units. The only reliable shipments are from P26 (307) and P27 (307). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire 3887 'In-transit' balance from the base stock calculation, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' to force a new order. I set a target service level base stock for roughly 3 periods of demand (approx 150-200 units). To achieve an actual order from the backend when it sees 3887 in transit, I use the formula: mu_hat = Target_Base_Stock + Phantom_Inventory. Target (200) + Phantom (3273) = ~3473. Decreasing the forecast slightly as we move deeper into autumn.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated: 3273 units are confirmed lost/missing (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). Demand has officially transitioned to a low-volume regime (approx 40 units/week) as the summer season ends.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26, marking the end of the summer season for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower regime (Period 26-28: 35, 38, 43 units), averaging approximately 40 units/week. The logistics system remains heavily compromised by 'phantom inventory'. Total units currently in-transit are 3887. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost or critically overdue: P1(249), P3(412), P4(344), P10(688), P13(831), P17(94), P19(655). This sums to 3273 units of phantom inventory. Subtracting this from the current 'In-transit' total of 3887 leaves 614 units of potentially valid inventory (the orders from P26 and P27, each 307 units). Since target base stock for the low-demand regime (avg 40/week, L=2) is approximately 120-150 units, and there are 614 units theoretically arriving soon, no new orders are required. However, the OR backend sees 3887 units in-transit and will not order if its target is lower. To prevent future stockouts if recent orders also fail, I set mu_hat using the explicit method to offset the 3273 phantom units + a small buffer for the baseline demand, though with 614 units already on the way relative to a 40/week demand, the system is covered if they arrive.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized at a late-summer/early-autumn low, with the last 4 periods averaging ~38 units per week (35, 43, 38, 35). The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' balance of 3887 units. Based on historical resolution, we have confirmed lost shipments for P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, and P19, totaling 3273 units of 'phantom inventory'. Additionally, the orders from P26 (307 units) and P27 (307 units) are now at or past the promised lead time of 2 periods without having arrived. If they haven't arrived by P30, the reliable in-transit volume is essentially zero. To prevent the OR backend from 'waiting' for these lost units, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the target safety stock plus a full offset for the 3273 phantom units. Target stock for (L+1)=3 periods at 40 units/week is roughly 120. Total mu_hat = 120 (Target) + 3273 (Offset) = 3393. This forces the engine to recognize a deficit despite the high in-transit number.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Phantom inventory total updated: 3273 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). Recent orders from P26 and P27 (614 units total) have not yet arrived as of P29 conclude, maintaining high logistics uncertainty. Demand has settled into a low regime of ~40 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '610776022' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has transitioned from a high-demand spring/summer peak (~300 units/week) to a low-volume autumn regime (~40 units/week). In Period 30, the shipment from P27 arrived (L=3), however the earlier shipment from P26 (307 units) is still missing. Combined with the extensive history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19), total phantom inventory is now 3,273 units. These phantom units represent 91% of the current 3,580 'In-transit' balance. To ensure the OR backend ignores these lost units and maintains sufficient stock for the current demand, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock is calculated as (L+1) * Mean_Demand (3 * 40 = 120), but I must add the 3,273 phantom units to this target to bypass the backend's subtraction of in-transit inventory. Expected demand is stable at ~40 units based on the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31, phantom inventory (lost shipments) has accumulated to 3,273 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19). Order P27 arrived in Period 30 with L=3, but P26 remains missing. Demand has stabilized in a low-seasonal regime of ~40 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-95.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its post-summer low-demand regime (Sept 2019), with demand stabilizing around 40 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 231 units, which covers approximately 6 periods of the current demand rate (~40 units/week). The 'In-transit' balance of 3580 is physically massive but functionally unreliable. By tracking historical orders, I have confirmed that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26 are logically lost or critically overdue. P27 arrived in Period 30, but P26 (307 units) is now 6 periods since ordering with no arrival, meeting the 'lost' criteria. This brings the total phantom inventory to 3580 units (the entire In-transit balance). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom inventory and refusing to order when needed, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method: mu_hat = (Desired Base Stock) + (Phantom Units). Desired base stock for (L+1=3) periods at ~40 units/week is ~120 units. Thus, mu_hat = 120 + 3580 = 3700. However, since On-hand (231) currently exceeds the desired base stock (120), no new order is required this period. I will set the parameters to reflect the low-demand regime while maintaining the phantom inventory offset.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated: 3580 units are confirmed lost/missing (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26). The 'In-transit' total is entirely composed of these non-arriving units. Demand is stable at ~40 units/week in the post-summer period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low-seasonal regime for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, averaging ~37 units over the last 5 weeks (P28-P32). On-hand inventory is 198 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' balance of 3580 units is entirely composed of phantom inventory (lost or critically overdue shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these 3580 units. However, current on-hand levels are sufficient for the immediate lead time. I will maintain an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand (approx 120 units) plus the 3580 phantom units to ensure the backend logic stays 'primed' but doesn't over-order while on-hand is high. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent low-demand stability.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has stabilized in a low-seasonal regime (approx. 40 units/week) following the summer peak. On-hand inventory is 165 units, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' balance of 3580 units is entirely composed of 'phantom inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and now P26, which is 8 periods overdue). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom inventory and blocking necessary future orders, I continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. The target base stock for a 2-period lead time (3 periods of coverage) at 40 units/week is roughly 120-150 units. Since on-hand is 165, no new orders are currently needed. I set mu_hat to (Estimated Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 150 + 3580 = 3730 to normalize the backend's view. L is set to 3 to reflect the most recent successful delivery (P27).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776022 (Women's Lightweight T-shirt) is in a stable post-summer low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 36 units/week (35, 38, 43, 35, 42, 34, 33, 33, 34). Inventory management remains severely complicated by 3,580 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 17, 19, and 26) that the OR backend treats as live in-transit stock. Current on-hand inventory is 131 units, which covers approximately 3.6 weeks of demand at the current rate. With a lead time of 2-3 periods, no immediate order is required. However, to ensure the OR backend doesn't permanently halt orders due to the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to a value that includes both the desired base stock and an offset for the lost units. With L=3, target inventory is ~144 units (4*36). Adding the 3,580 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 3724.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' has settled into a post-summer low-demand regime, averaging approximately 34 units/week over the last 9 periods (P27-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 106 units, which covers over 3 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' quantity of 3600 units is heavily distorted by phantom inventory (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P26) totaling 3580 units. The only 'real' active shipment is the 20 units ordered in P35. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 3600 units in transit and refusing to order, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat as Target_Inventory + Phantom_Inventory: with L=2, the safety stock target for 3 periods (L+1) is ~120 units (40/week * 3). Adding the 3580 phantom units gives a target mu_hat of 3700. This ensures that any future replenishment needs are not blocked by the lost shipments remaining in the system's pipeline inventory count.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated: 3580 units are confirmed lost/missing (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26). Demand remains stable in the post-summer low regime at ~34 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight t-shirt, which has transitioned from its peak spring/summer demand into a stable, low-volume regime for autumn/winter. Historical demand from Period 26 onwards confirms a consistent average of approximately 34-36 units per week. Phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains the primary challenge: orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26 are confirmed lost or critically overdue, totaling 3582 units. These units occupy the 'In-transit' field but will not satisfy demand. To force the OR backend to place necessary replenishment orders, an 'explicit' mu_hat must be used. This value is calculated as: (Base Stock for Target Inventory) + (Phantom Inventory Offset). Using a base stock of ~150 units (approx 4 weeks of demand at 35/week + safety stock) and adding the 3582 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 3732. This ensures the backend (which subtracts the 3582 in-transit units) still targets a real on-hand + healthy in-transit level of ~150 units. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect recent arrivals (P35 arrived in 1 period, P27 in 3 periods).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand, post-summer regime, with demand averaging ~34 units per week over the last 10 periods. Logistics show a mix of lost shipments and recent reliability (P35 arrived in 1 period, P27 in 3 periods). The most critical issue is the 'In-transit' balance of 3640 units, of which 3580 are confirmed lost or critically overdue (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26). Only the P36 (2 units) and P37 (58 units) orders are considered viable. To ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order for the upcoming (L+1) period demand, mu_hat is set to the Phantom Volume (3580) plus the projected safety stock for the current low-demand regime (~100 units). Setting mu_hat to 3680 via 'explicit' forces the algorithm to recognize that the phantom inventory provides no service level, effectively bypassing the pipeline deduction.

On-hand inventory is 105 units, which covers about 3 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 3582 units is entirely composed of phantom inventory (confirmed lost/critically overdue shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from the target (base_stock), it will not place any new orders as long as 3582 > base_stock. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate a target base stock for a (L+1) horizon (using L=2 as a safe default for logistics though recent L has been 1). Expected demand for (2+1) periods is ~90 units. Adding the 3582 phantom units to this target gives an explicit mu_hat of 3672. This forces the backend to see a requirement that exceeds the phantom in-transit volume, ensuring replenishment can occur if on-hand drops too low. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the current low-volatility regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable post-summer low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 28.8 units/week, significantly lower than the historical spring/summer peak. Inventory management is complicated by a massive 'phantom inventory' of 3,580 units in-transit. These units are confirmed lost or critically overdue (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26) and will not arrive. However, the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock. To ensure the backend places orders for current needs, mu_hat must be set to (Desired_Base_Stock + Phantom_Inventory). With L=2 and average demand ~30, the desired base stock is (1+2)*30 = 90. Adding the 3,580 phantom units results in a mu_hat of 3,670. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to provide a safety buffer against slight demand variations in this low-volume period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand regime (~20 units/week) following the end of the summer season. On-hand inventory is 84, which is sufficient for approximately 4 weeks of demand. The primary challenge is 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' field. History confirmed that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26 (totaling 3,580 units) are lost or critically overdue and will not arrive. However, the OR backend subtracts these 3,580 units from its order calculation, which would prevent any new orders from being placed for the rest of the game. To counteract this, I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target inventory for a (L+1) period (approx 3 * 20 = 60 units) and then add the 3,580 phantom units to this target. This forces the OR backend's logic [Order = Base Stock - (On-Hand + In-Transit)] to effectively ignore the 3,580 phantom units. Specifically: (60 + 3580) - (84 + 3593) results in a near-zero or small replenishment order as intended, maintaining the safety buffer without being blocked by lost shipments. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P35, P36, P37) show lead times of 1-3 periods, averaging near the promise of 2.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 610776022 (Womens Everyday T-shirt) has stabilized in a low-seasonal regime, averaging approximately 18 units per week over the last five periods (P37-P41). On-hand inventory is 71 units, which covers about 4 weeks of demand at the current rate. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 3593 units is heavily distorted by phantom inventory\u2014orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26 are confirmed lost or critically overdue and will likely never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places replenishment orders when needed, these lost units must be offset. Current 'active' reliable in-transit is only the order from P40 (13 units). I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to set a target that accounts for both the low demand forecast and the 3580 units of phantom inventory. With L=2 and average demand ~18, base stock should be ~54. Adding phantom units (3580), the mu_hat is set to 3634 to trigger appropriate replenishment logic.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand for this lightweight t-shirt has remained stable in a low-volume post-summer regime, averaging approximately 18 units per week over the last 5 periods (P38-P42). Logistics remain highly problematic with a significant 'phantom inventory' of 3,593 units in-transit (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26). These units are confirmed lost or critically overdue and will not arrive. The OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from its target base stock, which would result in zero orders despite needing a replenishment soon as on-hand inventory has dropped to 49 units. To correct for this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock (\u03bc * (L+Review)) and then add the phantom volume (3,593) to it. With L=2 and a review period of 1, the target coverage is 3 weeks. At 18 units/week, target is ~54 units. Adding 3,593 phantom units gives an explicit mu_hat of 3,647. This forces the backend to see a need for units despite the 'In-transit' bloat. I am setting L and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7 for demand volatility in the current regime; N=3 for recent lead times which have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a summer/spring staple. We are currently in December (Period 44), which is deep into the post-seasonal low-demand regime for this category. In the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand has been very low: 8, 15, 13, 22, 6 (average ~12.8 units/week). Logistics remain unstable, with recent lead times being 1 period (P37) and 3 periods (P36, P40). The primary concern is the massive phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' field. Total In-Transit is 3600 units, but 3580 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P26) that will never arrive. The only potentially real unit in transit is the 20 units ordered in P43. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 3600 units and refusing to order, I must calculate a Target Base Stock for the low-demand regime and add the 3580 phantom units to it. Using recent demand (approx 13/week) and L=2, a safe base stock is around 60-80 units. Adding 3580 units to this results in a mu_hat of ~3650. This 'fools' the OR engine into seeing the phantom units as 'required' stock, allowing it to place small replenishment orders if on-hand inventory (currently 56) drops below the safety level.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom inventory remains the dominant factor. 3580 units are confirmed lost/overdue (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P26) and must be countered by adding 3580 to mu_hat calculations. Demand has further softened in Dec to ~13 units/week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are in a low-demand regime (~13 units/week) approaching the end of the game year (Period 47). The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 3580 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, and P26. These units are still 'In-transit' in the backend's view, preventing necessary orders. Specifically, In-transit is 3604, which consists of the 3580 lost units plus P43 (20 units) and P44 (4 units). Since the OR backend subtracts the entire In-transit balance from its target inventory calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 3580 phantom units. Based on a target inventory of (L+1) * demand = (2+1) * 13 = 39, the backend calculation would be: order = 39 - (53 on-hand + 3604 in-transit) = -3618. To ensure the backend places small replenishment orders to maintain the 39-unit target, I must set mu_hat to approximately the phantom volume + target = 3580 + 39 = 3619. This 'fades' the phantom units out of the backend's subtraction logic. For sigma_hat, I used recent_N=5 to reflect the current low volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019. Demand for this SKU (women's lightweight jersey t-shirt) is at a seasonal low, averaging approximately 11 units per week over the last 5 periods (P41-P45). The major operational challenge is the 'In-transit' figure of 3584 units, which is almost entirely comprised of 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 17, 19, and 26 that are long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), it will not place any new orders unless these lost units are offset. To force the backend to maintain a safe inventory level, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (L+1)*Demand = 3*11 = 33 units. To offset 3584 lost units, mu_hat is set to 3617 (3584 + 33). This ensures the order calculation (3617 - 3584) targets a physical availability of ~33 units. I will use L=2 (promised) and explicit sigma_hat based on recent low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) total updated to 3584 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P26). These units must be countered by an explicit mu_hat offset. Demand remains in a winter low regime (~11 units/week).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a winter seasonal low, averaging approximately 11 units per week over the last 10 periods (N=10), significantly lower than the spring/summer peak. Logistics have shown mixed results but recent arrivals (P40, P43) suggest lead times of 2-3 periods are still common when they arrive at all. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the In-transit balance. There are 3584 units confirmed lost or critically overdue (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P19, P26) that will never arrive. The OR backend's order logic subtracts In-transit units from the base stock; to prevent it from under-ordering (or not ordering at all), I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-week window (L=2 + 1 review period) at current low demand (~11 * 3 = 33 units) and then add the 3584 phantom units to it. mu_hat = 3617. This ensures the OR backend ignores the lost units and maintains a small on-hand buffer for the low-volume season. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect the current low volatility.
