We are moving out of winter into spring in many markets, which typically sees a rise in demand for basic layering pieces like T-shirts. Historical Demand: Recent data shows 2019-01-07: 53; 01-14: 132; 01-21: 222; 01-28: 242; 02-04: 233. There was a significant ramp-up in January, stabilizing around 230-240 units per week. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover the current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3), I need enough stock to satisfy approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1). Forecast: Conservatively estimating 235 units per week. Target Pipeline: 235 * 3 = 705 units. Current Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Decision: I need to place an order for 705 units to establish the pipeline and meet demand once the shipment arrives in Period 3.",

The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order of 705 placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3's resolution phase and will be visible in the P4 decision phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the P1 order is still in transit, resulting in lost sales of 267 units in P1. We need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (P2, P3, P4). Based on the rising trend (233 to 267), I estimate demand at ~280-300 per period. Target pipeline (P2-P4) should be ~900 units.

Demand has been consistently low for several months, with the most recent four weeks averaging approximately 14.5 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 1175 units, which is far more than enough to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (Periods 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47). Even at a conservative demand estimate of 40 units per week (the upper end of the 'winter trough' mentioned in Carry-over Insights), the total required inventory to the end of the game would only be 200 units. Since holding costs are $1.0 per unit/period, the priority is to minimize the ending inventory to avoid massive profit erosion. Ordering any more units will only increase holding costs without providing any additional sales benefit. Therefore, the order quantity remains 0.",

Even if demand were to triple during the final three periods, the current stock would cover it hundreds of times over.

On-hand inventory stands at 1,166 units, which is extremely excessive for the remaining 3 periods (P45, P46, P47), even if demand were to spike ten-fold. Every unit held incurs a $1.00 cost per period, while profit is $4.00. Minimizing holding cost is now the primary objective to preserve accumulated profit. No more orders should be placed.

The current on-hand inventory is 1,158 units. The maximum possible demand for the final two periods (P46 and P47) combined, even under an extreme spike, would not exceed 50 units based on recent patterns (Avg ~10/week). Therefore, there is a massive inventory surplus. Any additional units ordered would only serve to increase holding costs ($1.0/unit) without any possibility of being sold, as the game ends next period and Lead Time (L+1) would mean any order placed now arrives after the game's conclusion.

There is an massive on-hand inventory surplus of 1,153 units, which is more than enough to cover any remaining demand. Since any ending inventory at the conclusion of Period 47 will incur holding costs without any further opportunity for sales, and there are no subsequent periods to manage, the optimal action is to place no new orders.
