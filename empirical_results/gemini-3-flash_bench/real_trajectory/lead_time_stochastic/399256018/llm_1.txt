  "rationale": "Product 399256018 is a pair of women's skinny ankle jeans. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend leading into February (72, 81, 87, 104, 149), likely reflecting the start of spring fashion shopping as customers transition from heavy winter wear to lighter denim. Today's date is 2019-02-11. The last known demand point was 149. Given the upward trajectory and the promised lead time of 2 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (arrival window). I estimate demand will continue to grow or stabilize around 150-170 units per week. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need a significant order to establish inventory. Target inventory = Expected demand for (L+1) periods + safety stock. 160 * 3 = 480. I will order 480 units to cover the pipeline.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 399256018 is a women's skinny ankle jean. Historical demand shows a steady upward trend from Jan 7th (72 units) to Feb 4th (149 units). Period 1 (Feb 11th) saw a significant jump to 195 units, likely signaling the start of the spring fashion season and high demand for ankle-length styles. For Period 2 (Feb 18th), I expect demand to remain high or continue its upward trajectory, potentially reaching 200-240 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and I have 480 units in transit (ordered in Period 1). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, those 480 units are expected to arrive in Period 3. This means that both Period 2 and Period 3 demand must be covered by what is currently in the pipeline or on hand. Period 1 demand (195) resulted in 195 units of lost sales. My pipeline (480) covers approximately 2 periods of demand if demand stabilizes around 240. To maintain a safety stock and prepare for Period 4 arrivals (which must be ordered now in Period 2), I calculate the target inventory for the lead time + 1 period (P2, P3, P4). Total demand expected: ~240 (P2) + ~250 (P3) + ~250 (P4) = 740 units. Current pipeline is 480. I will order an additional 260 units to secure the stock for the coming weeks.",

The average demand over the last two periods is ~187 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (480 units) are expected to arrive during P3 resolution, meaning they will be available for sale in P3 and visible in the P4 start report. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 740 (480 from P1 + 260 from P2). Currently, we are experiencing stockouts because we started with 0 inventory and the lead time has not yet elapsed. I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Total demand expected for P3, P4, and P5 is approximately 187 * 3 = 561 units. Since 740 units are already in the pipeline, which covers the 561 requirement plus a safety buffer for the high variance and potential trend growth, I will place a smaller order to maintain the pipeline flow without overstocking, as holding costs are significant ($1/unit).

Historically, January demand was low (~86), but February demand spiked significantly (Feb 4: 149; Feb 11-25 average: 164). Period 3 (Feb 25) showed a softening to 119, which might indicate the initial surge is stabilizing or that stockouts (though not explicitly 'lost demand' in the text, the demand was 119 while on-hand was 0) are influencing observed data. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (480), P2 (260), P3 (150). Based on L=2, the P1 order (480) is expected to arrive during 'Arrival Resolution' of Period 3 and will be visible in the inventory at the start of Period 4 (current). Note: The game history shows P3 conclude: arrived=0. Per the rules, an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3 resolution and is visible at the start of P4. Therefore, I expect 480 units to be on-hand now OR to appear in the P4 conclude. My current on-hand is 0, meaning the arrival hasn't been registered in the 'Status' yet. Total pipeline is 890 units. Estimated demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) is approximately 140/week (420 total). With 890 already in transit (covering roughly 6 weeks of demand), I have sufficient coverage for the immediate horizon.

Average demand over the last 4 weeks is ~147. c) Lead Time: Order from P2 arrived in P4 (lead_time = 2). Order from P1 (480 units) is significantly overdue (promised L=2, now at L=4 with no arrival). Based on instructions, missing shipments beyond promised lead time suggest lost orders. I will treat the P1 order (480 units) as lost. d) Inventory: On-hand is 164.

(b) Demand Analysis: Demand has dropped from a peak of 195 (Feb 11) to 85 (Mar 11). The mean of the last three periods (119, 96, 85) is approximately 100. (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2.

The order from Period 3 (150 units) should have arrived in Period 5 (visible in Period 6 START), but 'Period 5 conclude' shows 0 arrivals.

P2 (L=2) and P5 (L=1) arrived successfully. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory. In-transit includes P6 (120 units, 2 periods elapsed) and P7 (100 units, 1 period elapsed).

However, looking at the 'In-transit' figure of 910 provided by the system, it suggests the system still counts P1 (480), P3 (150), P10 (180), and P11 (100) totaling 910. Given that P1 and P3 are extreme outliers in terms of expected arrival, I treat the effective pipeline as P10 (180) and P11 (100).

Seasonally, this is a transitional period where 'Everyday' denim typically maintains stable demand. Historical demand analysis shows: Jan (~86), Feb peak (~164 avg), March (~123 avg), April (~113 avg). Recent demand in P12 was 132. The mean demand for the last 6 periods is approximately 111 units. The supply chain is highly unreliable: P1 and P3 shipments were lost, while delivered orders (P2, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9) show lead times toggling between 1 and 2 periods. Currently, On-hand is low (21 units). In-transit is very high (1010 units), including orders from P10 (180), P11 (100), and P12 (100) that are expected soon, but also older lost units (P1, P3). Specifically, P10 (ordered Period 10) is currently at L=2 and should arrive this period or next. Because the pipeline is extremely congested relative to the current demand mean (~111), and a 180-unit shipment is expected to arrive during this period's resolution (visible next period), I will place a zero order to avoid excessive holding costs on the 1000+ units currently in the pipeline.",

  "rationale": "The product is skinny jeans for women. Historically, demand was highest in late Spring (Feb-May, ~110-130 units) and lowest in Summer (~35 units). Since late August (Period 27 onwards), demand has stabilized in an Autumn/Back-to-School regime, averaging 74.5 units over the last 14 periods (P26-P39) and approx 71 units over the most recent 5 periods. With the date now Nov 11, we are entering the pre-holiday/winter season. Historically for fashion, November remains steady or sees a slight peak before clearance cycles. Lead time reliability remains problematic: while the promised L=2 exists, we see frequent L=1 and L=3 arrivals, and many historical orders are confirmed lost. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 1565 units, but 1340 of these are identified in carry-over insights as lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P29). Subtracting these, the real pipeline (Period 34, 38, 39 orders) is 225 units. On-hand is 55. Total reliable inventory = 55 (on-hand) + 225 (in-transit) = 280 units. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted demand of 75 units/period plus a safety buffer for lead time volatility, I need approximately 300 units. Since 280 are already in the reliable system, a maintenance order of 75 units is placed to keep the pipeline full against the weekly depletion.",

Recent demand (P37-P40) has averaged 66 units/period, showing a slight softening from the mid-autumn peak of ~80. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is only 6 units, and the pipeline is heavily obscured by historical lost shipments. Total In-transit is 1640 units; however, 1490 of these are confirmed/presumed lost (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, P29, and now P34, as P34's 75 units are overdue by 6 periods). This leaves only 150 units as viable 'live' pipeline (75 from P38, 75 from P39, and 75 from P40). Actual lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. With only 6 units on hand and 150 units in the 'live' pipeline, I need to cover demand for Period 41 (the current period) plus the 2-3 period lead time window. Using a safety-adjusted forecast of ~75 units/period for 3 periods (P41, P42, P43) suggests a target of 225 units. Total viable stock (6 on hand + 150 live pipeline) is 156.
