Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 506098007 (Push-up bras). Looking at the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), we see a significant upward trend from ~11-12 units to ~59-82 units in the last two weeks of Jan/early Feb. This aligns with the pre-Valentine's Day demand surge for lingerie. Given that the current date is Feb 11, we are in the week leading up to Valentine's Day. I expect demand to remain high or peak this week before potentially tapering off. Since on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0, and the promised lead time is 2, an order placed now will arrive in Period 3 (Week of Feb 25). The OR backend uses (1+L) as the horizon. For L=2, it covers 3 weeks of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high-demand regime (mean of [48, 82, 59] is ~63) rather than the lower January start, to ensure sufficient stock for the tail end of the season and subsequent weeks.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the product (Liza Push Melbourne 2pk) and the dates, we see a significant demand spike in the last few weeks: Period 1 demand was 67 units following a sample of 59 and 82 in preceding weeks. The average demand over the last 3 samples (82, 59, 67) is 69.3. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Therefore, the order-up-to level should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent higher-demand regime. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and 92 in-transit (ordered in P1, expected P3), and we likely have an out-of-stock situation given P1 demand (67) exceeded P1 inventory (0), the OR backend needs to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current pipeline. L is set to 'default' (2). mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of last 3 samples (approx 3 * 69.3 = 208). sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L) * std of last 3 samples to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-28: mean demand increased from ~11-12 to ~69 (based on last 3 samples: 82, 59, 67).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25, 2019. Demand for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has stabilized at a higher level compared to early January. The last five demand samples are: 48, 82, 59, 67, 71, averaging ~65.4 units/week. This confirms the previously noted demand regime shift. Inventory is currently zero, with 181 units in-transit (92 from Period 1, 89 from Period 2). Given a promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order (92 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 3) and will be visible in the Period 4 start. Because we have no conclusive evidence that actual lead time differs from the promise, I will use L=2. To capture the recent higher demand pattern while smoothing noise, I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average ~65.4) and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (~196 units) which aligns well with our current pipeline of 181 units plus the new order to be generated.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 4 (2019-03-04), we are in a high-demand regime for the 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' bra. The last four demand samples are 82, 59, 67, 71, and 54, averaging approximately 66.6 units per week. Although the promised lead time (L) is 2, we have not seen any arrivals from the order placed in Period 1 (92 units). However, according to the 'Lead Time Definition' and 'Critical Timing Example', an order with L=2 placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3 and its confirmation is only visible at the start of Period 4. Since the Period 3 conclude message shows 0 arrivals, the Period 1 order (92 units) is likely delayed or lost. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 215 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). To recover from the stockout and maintain the service level for this high-demand item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current regime (~333 for L+1=3 weeks) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the volatility in this period. I will use 'calculate' for L to monitor if the actual lead time is drifting from the promised 2 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019-03-11). The historical data and recent game history show a significant demand regime shift that began in late January. The last 4 observed demands are 67, 71, 54, and 68, averaging approximately 65 units per period. The initial demand samples (11, 12) are no longer relevant. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). We have 21 units on-hand and 127 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4). However, the P1 order (92 units) is now overdue (placed P1, promised L=2, should have arrived by P3 conclude). Given its absence, I suspect it may be lost. To ensure availability, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the 65-unit average. Since L=2, base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods, roughly 195 units. Current reliable inventory (on-hand 21 + pipeline 35) is 56. If P1 is lost, we are significantly under-stocked. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new high-demand, high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lost shipment detected for Order P1 (92 units); it is 2 periods past promised lead time with no arrival recorded. Demand regime established at ~65 units/period since 2019-01-28.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/03/18), the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units. Demand has stabilized into a persistent regime averaging ~63 units per period (last 5 samples: 67, 71, 54, 68, 54). A significant logistical issue is confirmed: Order P1 (92 units from Period 1) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery date and must be treated as lost. However, Order P2 (89 units) arrived on schedule in Period 4 (lead_time=2). Order P3 (34 units) was due in Period 5 but has not arrived; it is now 1 period overdue. Given 'In-transit' is 185 (which equals P1+P3+P4+P5 = 92+34+1+58), and P1 is likely lost, the 'functional' pipeline is only 93 units. Since the OR backend includes the lost P1 in its pipeline calculation, it will under-order unless I use 'explicit' to force a higher base stock. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate (3 * 63 = 189) plus a buffer for the lost 92 units to trigger an order that compensates for the inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed shipment loss for Order P1 (92 units) - now 3 periods overdue. Current demand regime stabilized at mean ~63 since 2019-01-28.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25. The product is a women's push-up bra. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime since late January, with recent samples (67, 71, 54, 68, 54, 49) averaging 60.5. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times are unstable: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period, and P1 is confirmed lost (now 4 periods past order date). On-hand inventory is low (9 units). In-transit inventory stands at 235 units (P3: 34, P4: 1, P6: 108, P7: 92 estimate). I will assume a standard lead time of 2 for safety. Given the regime shift, I will use recent_N (N=6) to estimate mu_at and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable but higher demand compared to the very early January samples.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Lead time variability confirmed (P2=2, P5=1) alongside confirmed loss of P1. Demand remains stable in the 50-70 range (avg ~60) since the January shift.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 1st, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 506098007 shows a stable regime since late January, with recent weekly demands of 67, 71, 54, 68, 54, 49, and 59. The average demand during this period is approximately 60.2. Order P1 (92 units from Period 1) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost, meaning the pipeline inventory of 235 units consists only of subsequent orders that are largely within the delivery window, though on-hand is currently 0. Lead times have been inconsistent (P2 arrived in L=2, P5 arrived in L=1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this variability. For demand, I'll use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand regime that started roughly 7 periods ago, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers this ~60 units/period volume across the lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's push-up bra. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since late January, with recent demand samples (85, 59, 49, 54, 68) averaging around 63 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, though we've seen actual lead times of 1 and 2, plus one lost shipment (P1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 23 units and in-transit is 127 units. To maintain service levels in this stabilized demand regime without overstocking (the OR backend's cap helps here), I will use the last 6 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable period post-regime shift. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed variability (L=1 and L=2).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand regime remains stable with a mean of ~63 units/period over the last 6 weeks. Pipeline inventory (127) is sufficient compared to expected demand over the lead time, considering on-hand (23) is low.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the inventory state for SKU 506098007 shows 0 units on-hand and 181 units in-transit. The demand regime has stabilized since late January; excluding the initial low-demand samples, the average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 63.3 units (range 49-85). I am using recent_N=9 to capture this specific post-shift regime. The confirmed loss of the Period 1 order (92 units) continues to impact the pipeline inventory accuracy. Observed successful lead times have been 2 periods (P2, P6) and 1 period (P5). Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect this empirical average (~1.67 periods). With 181 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P9, and the likely lost P1), the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that accounts for the current demand mean of ~63. Despite the high in-transit number, the stock-outs in Periods 5, 7, and 9 indicate that supply timing is volatile. I will maintain mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable regime since Period 1 to prevent over-ordering while stock-outs are managed through future arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-22. On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a total of 151 units in-transit. Based on the demand history, a regime shift occurred in late January/early February 2019, with demand stabilizing around a mean of 60-65 units per week. In the last 5 periods (Periods 6-10), demand has been 49, 59, 85, 57, and 55, resulting in a mean of 61. For the OR parameters, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this stable regime more accurately than using the full history (which includes low-demand periods from January). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P5 took 1, P6 took 2, P9 took 1). Period 1's order is confirmed lost. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the average of observed lead times (2, 1, 2, 1), which is 1.5. This balanced approach helps mitigate the risk of stockouts without incurring excessive holding costs, especially since on-hand is currently depleted.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand regime consistently averaging 61 units over the last 5 periods, confirming the stabilization noted in earlier periods. Lead time variability persists between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/04/29), on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 204 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent orders from Period 3 (34 units, now severely overdue and likely lost), Period 4 (1 unit, likely lost), Period 10 (24 units, expected now or next period), and Period 11 (53 units, expected in 1-2 periods), plus any previous unarrived orders. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since late January, with recent demand figures being 57, 55, and 52. The mean demand over the last 10 samples (since the regime shift) is approximately 63.3 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P4 arrived L=2, P6 arrived L=1, P8 arrived L=2, P10 arrived L=1). I will set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this stable post-shift demand. Given the stockout in Period 11, the OR backend needs to target a base stock covering approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1) to recover and maintain service levels, accounting for the 1.5-period average lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order from Period 3 (34 units) and Period 4 (1 unit) are now over 7 periods overdue; confirmed as lost along with P1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '506098007' (Womens Lingerie) is in Period 13 (2019-05-06). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 60.1 units per period over the last 10 samples (range 45-85). There is significant reliability concern with the supply chain: orders from Period 1 (92 units), Period 3 (34 units), and Period 4 (1 unit) are confirmed lost as they are far beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Recent arrivals (orders from P5, P6, and P9) show lead times varying between 1 and 2 periods. The in-transit inventory of 204 units includes the order from Period 10 (24 units - now overdue at L=3 if not arrived), Period 11 (53 units - L=2), and any orders placed in Period 12 (0 units). Given the high loss rate and current zero on-hand balance, I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to reflect the stable demand regime (~60) and keep L at default (2) to target a pipeline that covers 3 periods of demand (~180 units). The sigma_hat will be calculated from the same N=10 to account for recent volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The SKU 506098007 (Women's Lingerie) is in a stable demand regime following the initial January shift. Over the last 10 periods (since Period 4), demand has averaged approximately 57 units (range 37-85), though the most recent sample (37) suggests a potential cooling or simple variance. On-hand inventory is 16. In-transit inventory stands at 151 units, which includes 24 units from Period 10 (now overdue by 1 period, potential lag or loss) and 24 units from Period 10 (ordered Period 10, arrived 0), however, checking history: Period 10 ordered 24, Period 11 ordered 53. The 'In-transit' of 151 likely consists of the Period 10 order (24) and the Period 11 order (53 - arrived in P13? No, P13 conclude says P11 arrived). Let's recalculate pipeline: Orders from P1, P3, P4 are confirmed lost (92+34+1 = 127). Current In-transit 151 - 127 lost = 24 units active (the P10 order). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (Avg ~1.5). I will use explicit L=2 to be conservative given recent transit issues. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the stabilized average demand of ~55-60 units/period, ensuring the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the pipeline gap created by lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '506098007' is in a stable demand regime after a shift in late January. Over the last 10 periods, demand has averaged ~56 units, but the most recent 5 periods show a slight cooling to ~47 units. Current on-hand is 0, with a pipeline of 174. Orders from Period 1, 3, 4, 10, and 12 are considered lost or significantly overdue, but recent orders (P11) are arriving within the promised 2-period window or less (P9 arriving in 1). The pipeline includes an order of 0 from P13 (effectively nil), and P14 (23 units). The base stock calculation must bridge the current stockout. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual seen lead times (1-2 periods) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 (mean ~47) to capture the recent slight softening in demand while maintaining a buffer for the (L+1) period coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed over last 5 periods (mean ~47 vs previous ~63). Shipping reliability remains fragmented with multiple lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P12) but recent deliveries (P11) arriving on-time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '506098007' is currently in a cooling demand phase. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15), demand has averaged 44.8, a significant decrease from the previous regime average of ~63. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 174, but history shows extreme unreliability. Specifically, orders from P1 (92 units), P3 (34 units), P4 (1 unit), P10 (24 units), and P12 (0) are logically lost based on being many periods past their scheduled arrival. Only orders from P14 (23 units) are reliably in-transit within the expected lead time. However, the system reports 'In-transit: 174', which includes the lost units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (including ghosts) from the base stock, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to 195 units (calculated as (1+L) * demand of 45, plus an offset of ~60 units). This offset helps neutralize the 'ghost' pipeline units to ensure a physical order is actually placed to meet the cooling but steady demand of ~45 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~45 units/period over the last 5 weeks compared to previous ~63 (-28%). Pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by 151 units from multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), demand has shown a slight spike (68) but the recent mean (last 5 periods) is approximately 48.0. The on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit of 203 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments: P1 (92), P3 (34), P4 (1), P10 (24), and likely P12 (0 units, but P12 was an order opportunity) totaling 151 units that will never arrive. Effectively, the reliable pipeline inventory is only 52 units (P14: 23 units, P16: 29 units). The OR engine subtracts 'in-transit' from the base stock. If I leave in-transit at 203, it will not order anything because it thinks 203 > base stock (~150). To correct this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to encompass both the demand forecast for (L+1) periods AND a 'correction factor' to override the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean_demand = 3 * 48 = 144. To ensure the backend orders enough, I need mu_hat - (Total In-transit) to result in a positive order. However, since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline', I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at a value that forces the order to bridge the gap. Setting mu_hat to 350 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the 203 phantom in-transit and triggers an order to replenish the 0 on-hand state, while using recent_N for sigma to maintain realistic safety stock based on recent demand volatility (std dev of last 5 periods \u2248 11, sqrt(3)*11 \u2248 19).

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory remains critically inflated by 151 units of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10). Effective pipeline is only 52 units. Explicit mu_hat adjustment required to bypass OR backend subtraction of dead inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), the SKU continues to face significant inventory management challenges due to lost shipments. The 'In-transit' figure of 310 units is heavily inflated by lost orders from Period 1 (92), Period 3 (34), Period 4 (1), Period 10 (24), Period 12 (0), and Period 14 (23), totaling 174 'ghost' units. The actual effective pipeline consists only of the order from Period 17 (136 units). Current demand is in a cooling phase, averaging ~49 units over the last 5 periods (68, 45, 45, 37, 52). With On-hand at 0 and 136 units expected to arrive in Period 18 or 19 (L=1 or 2), the OR backend would normally subtract the 310 in-transit units from the base stock and place no order. To prevent a stockout, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 174 lost units. I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand over L+1 periods) + (Lost Units) = (49 * 3) + 174 = 321. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order that accounts for the current demand regime while neutralizing the dead pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' units in pipeline total 174 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Effective pipeline as of Period 18 start is 136 units (ordered Period 17). Demand cooling stabilization mean at ~49 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for SKU 506098007 shows a cooling trend with the most recent demand sample at 21 units, contributing to a 5-period average of approximately 43 units. The in-transit inventory is significantly inflated by historical lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (92), P3 (34), P4 (1), P10 (24), and P14 (23) are collectively 174 'ghost' units that have never arrived and are well past the maximum observed lead time of 2 periods. The backend OR logic subtracts the total in-transit (340) from its calculated base stock. To prevent the system from being paralyzed by this 174-unit ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. The effective pipeline inventory is 204 units (136 from P17, 30 from P18, plus 38 from orders not yet resolved). With a cooling demand mean of ~43, the base stock for (L+1)=3 periods would normally be around 140-160 units. To force an order that bridges the gap created by the 174 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat to 350. This ensures (mu_hat - in_transit) remains positive (350 - 340 = 10 units base order before capping), while relying on the OR backend's safety stock and internal capping to prevent extreme over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' units in pipeline is 174 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Demand cooling continues, with the latest sample at 21 units and a 5-period mean of ~43 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units are 345, but a large portion consists of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments: P1 (92), P3 (34), P4 (1), P10 (24), and P14 (23), totaling 174 units. The actual effective pipeline consists of Order P17 (136) and Order P19 (35), totaling 171 units. Order P17, placed with a lead time of 1-2 periods, is due to arrive this period. Average demand has cooled significantly to ~40 units/period (last 5 samples: 45, 68, 37, 21, 38). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 174 ghost units and suppressing orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I will target a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 plus current) approx 120 units. Since effective pipeline (171) already exceeds this, even with the current stockout, no new order is needed immediately. However, to bypass the backend's logic which subtracts the full pipeline (345), I set mu_hat high enough to reflect the need for the arrivals of P17. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Current Effective Pipeline: 171 units (Orders P17, P19). Total Ghost Pipeline: 174 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~40 units/period over the last 5 weeks.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), several critical logistics and demand factors are present. Logistics: The total 'In-transit' pipeline is 385 units, but 174 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14), which will never arrive. Additionally, the order from Period 17 (136 units) is now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2); given the history of losses, this is highly likely lost. The total ghost pipeline is now estimated at 310 units (174 + 136). The effective pipeline consists only of P19 (35 units) and P20 (40 units), totaling 75 units. Demand: There has been a recent spike (89 units in P20), but the 5-period average is ~45 and the product (Push-up bras) doesn't show extreme seasonality in July. OR Backend Adjustment: Since the backend subtracts the full 385 units of pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 310 lost units. Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods is ~150 units (50/period * 3). To ensure an order is triggered despite the 385 pipeline, I set explicit mu_hat = 150 + 310 = 460. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variable 1-2 period actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory increased to 310 units as Order P17 (136 units) is 2+ periods overdue and considered lost. Effective pipeline is only 75 units (Orders P19, P20). Demand spiked to 89 in P20 but the rolling 5-period average remains near 45-50.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the in-transit inventory is 500 units, but a large portion consists of 'ghost' units from lost shipments. Based on history: P1(92), P3(34), P4(1), P10(24), P12(0 - effectively none), P14(23), and recently P17(136) are all significantly overdue (>2 periods past promised lead time) and likely lost. Total Ghost Inventory = 92+34+1+24+23+136 = 310 units. Total In-transit (500) - Ghost (310) = 190 units of 'Effective' pipeline (Orders P19, P20, P21). Demand has spiked recently (P20: 89, P21: 110), likely due to early summer/July seasonality for lingerie. The last 5 periods (37, 21, 38, 89, 110) average ~59 units/period. Calculating mu_hat explicitly to account for the ghost inventory: The OR backend logic is Order = base_stock - Pipeline. If base_stock is (1+L)*demand and L=2, base_stock is 3*59 = 177. If we use natural parameters, the backend sees 500 in pipeline and orders 0. To force an order, we must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - Total_In_transit) results in the desired stocking level. Desired base_stock is ~180. To bypass the 500 in pipeline, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Outcome + Total In-transit) = 180 + 500 = 680 to ensure the backend covers the demand while ignoring the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand spike confirmed (P20-21 avg 99.5) likely seasonal. Ghost inventory total updated to 310 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Effective pipeline is 190 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand spiked significantly to 169 units, following a trend of increasing demand (P20: 89, P21: 110). This confirms a mid-summer seasonal surge for lingerie/bras. Current On-hand is 0. The In-transit inventory of 691 units is heavily compromised by 'ghost' shipments. Confirmed lost/ghost orders: P1(92), P3(34), P4(1), P10(24), P12(0), P14(23), P17(136). Total Ghost = 310. Effective Pipeline = Total In-transit (691) - Ghost (310) = 381 units. The orders contributing to the effective pipeline are P19(35), P20(40 - arrived, remove), P21(115), and P22(231). Wait, P20 arrived (40 units), so In-transit should be 691-40=651. Ghost is 310. Effective Pipeline is 341 units (P19, P21, P22). With demand now averaging ~120 over the last 3 weeks, we expect L+1 (3 periods) of demand to be ~360. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the 310 ghost units it thinks are real, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (Effective Pipeline + Target Safety Stock) + Ghost pipeline to offset the backend's subtraction. Target: (3 periods * 125 avg) + (1.5 * 50 sigma) + 310 ghost = 375 + 75 + 310 = 760.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge confirmed: Demand increased from avg ~45 to avg ~122 (+170%) over the last 3 weeks (P20-22). Total confirmed ghost units in pipeline: 310 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17).

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 starts with 239 units on-hand after a heavy arrival period (346 units total in Period 23). The demand regime has clearly shifted upward in July (P20: 89, P21: 110, P22: 169, P23: 107), likely due to a mid-summer seasonal peak for lingerie/bras. The average demand over these 4 weeks is 118.75. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand at this new level. The in-transit inventory is 486 units, but it contains 310 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 176 units (486 - 310). Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (486), I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to compensate. Setting mu_hat at 665 units represents a forecasted demand of ~120/period over 3 periods (L=2 plus current), incremented by 310 units to neutralize the ghost inventory (360 + 310 = 670). This ensures the OR logic [Base Stock - Total In-transit] results in a net order that maintains the necessary safety stock for the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime for July stabilized at ~119 units/period (last 4 samples). Total ghost pipeline remains 310 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Effective pipeline is currently 176 units (Order P23 + whatever remains of P19/P20).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/29. Demand has stabilized at a high summer regime, averaging approximately 110-120 units over the last 4 weeks (110, 169, 107, 106). The current on-hand inventory is 133 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 486 units, but this remains heavily inflated by 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1=92, P3=34, P4=1, P10=24, P12=0, P14=23, P17=136). The total ghost pipeline is 310 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 486 - 310 = 176 units (all from Order P23). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P21=2, P22=1). To ensure the OR backend places an appropriate order given the 310 units of dead inventory it will subtract, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the review+lead period (L+1 = 3 periods) to be 115 * 3 = 345. To offset the 310 units of ghost inventory, I set mu_hat to 345 + 310 = 655. This forces the backend to see a requirement that covers both real demand and the phantom inventory. I set L to 2 to be conservative.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed ghost units in pipeline remains 310 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). July demand regime confirmed at ~120 units/period (mean of last 4 samples).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: We are entering August (2019/8/5). Demand is showing a softening from the July peak of ~120; Period 25 demand was 68. The current mean for the last 5 samples is approx 108, but the latest 3 samples (107, 106, 68) show a decreasing trend. On-hand inventory is 65. The pipeline (In-transit: 567) is heavily inflated by 'ghost units' (lost shipments). Confirmed Ghost Units: 310 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Additionally, Order P11 (53 units, expected P13) which arrived on P13 is still showing in total pipeline calculation, but orders P19 (35), P20 (40), P21 (115), P22 (231) have all arrived. Only P23 (141) and P25 (81) are realistically in-transit. Combined with the 310 established ghost units, the total 'dead' inventory in the pipeline remains exceptionally high. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 567 units and ordering nothing, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the expected demand over the lead time PLUS the ghost inventory volume to offset the subtraction. Forecast: ~90 units/period (reflecting early August slowdown). Target base stock = (1+L)*forecast = 3*90 = 270. Offset = 270 + 310 (ghost) = 580. Setting mu_hat to 580 to ensure the backend covers current demand while 'ignoring' the 310 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand softening observed entering August (68 units in P25 vs ~120 in July). Total ghost pipeline remains 310 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Shipping reliability stabilized for recent major orders (P20, P21, P22).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019-08-12), the demand for this lingerie SKU (506098007) is showing a post-summer cooling trend. After a significant July peak where demand averaged ~120 units/period, demand has dropped to 68 and 59 over the last two weeks. The 5-period average is now approximately 88. Pipeline integrity remains the primary concern. Total 'In-transit' is 427 units, but 310 of these (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) are confirmed lost shipments or 'ghost' inventory. Only 117 units (inclusive of recent orders P25 and P26) are biologically in-transit. On-hand inventory is healthy at 147 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 427 in-transit and 147 on-hand (Total 574) and stopping all orders while we actually only have ~264 effective total, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at 80 units/period (total 240) plus a large buffer to offset the 310 ghost units. Setting mu_hat to 550 effectively forces the base stock high enough to account for the truth: on-hand 147 + effective in-transit 117 = 264. 264 is barely above the 3-period demand requirement of 240, so small maintenance orders are appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: Demand dropped from ~120 units/period in July to ~64 units/period in August (last 2 samples). Total ghost inventory in pipeline remains 310 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019-08-19), demand has shifted from a July peak (~120 units/period) to a stable August cooling regime. The last three demand samples are 68, 59, and 55, confirming a new mean of approximately 60.7 units/period. The pipeline inventory currently shows 386 units, but 310 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) that never arrived. The effective pipeline is actually 76 units (386 - 310), consisting of Order P26 (1 unit) and Order P27 (40 units), plus any residual logic. With on-hand inventory at 173 and effective pipeline at 76, the total effective inventory is 249 units. Against a demand of ~61 units/period and a lead time of 2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (~183 units). Since 249 > 183, no new orders are necessary. However, the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (386) from the base stock. If I used default methods, the backend would see a massive surplus and order 0. To prevent future stockouts once this excess on-hand is depleted, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a base stock value that accounts for the ghost inventory. Base Stock = (Target Demand x (L+1)) + Ghost Units. 183 + 310 = 493. I will set mu_hat (which the backend treats as the base stock anchor) to a level that ensures the system recognizes the true inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed at mean ~61 units/period (last 3 samples: 68, 59, 55). Total ghost units in pipeline remain 310 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Effective pipeline inventory is vastly lower than the reported 386 units.

The total reported 'In-transit' inventory of 386 units contains 310 units of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). The actual effective pipeline is 76 units (386 total - 310 ghost), which consists of orders from P26 (1 unit), P27 (40 units), and P28 (0 units) plus potentially un-received portions of older orders. On-hand inventory is healthy at 116 units. Given the stabilized mean demand of ~60 and a lead time (L) of 2, the required base stock is approximately (2+1)*60 = 180 units. With 116 on-hand and ~41 in legitimate transit, we are close to the target. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the inflated 'In-transit' figure in the OR backend's order calculation, setting it to cover current stabilized demand for the lead time and review period (3 units total).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Push Melbourne 2pk' has stabilized in a post-summer regime. The last five samples (68, 59, 55, 57, 49) show a mean of 57.6 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 67 units with 'ghost' pipeline units still present. The in-transit inventory is listed as 386 units, but 310 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Subtracting these from the total in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 76 units (actually consisting primarily of the Order P27 for 40 units placed recently). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 386 units and placing no orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Since z* is approximately 0.84 (q=0.8), I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods plus safety stock. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 periods * 58) + (0.84 * sqrt(3) * 10) \u2248 174 + 15 = 189. However, to 'force' an order despite the 386 recorded in-transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to bypass the backend's (base_stock - pipeline) calculation. Current on-hand (67) + in-transit (386) = 453. I will set mu_hat at 453 to maintain current levels or slightly higher if I want to replenish against the effective pipeline. Given the stable demand and sufficient on-hand for the immediate period, I will set mu_hat to 460 to ensure the policy remains responsive without over-ordering excessively while the backend resolves the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand stabilization confirmed: mean 58 units/period (P25-P29). Ghost pipeline inventory remains 310 units; backend parameters must be adjusted explicitly to account for this 310-unit discrepancy in reported 'In-transit'.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a post-summer demand stabilization phase. The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 54.5 units per period. In Period 31, we have 68 units on hand and a reported in-transit of 364 units. However, we have confirmed that 310 units in the pipeline are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). The effective pipeline is actually only 54 units (P19, P20, P23, P25, P26 are likely settled or lost; currently, only P30 (18 units) and potentially P26/P27 are relevant). Given the on-hand (68) and effective pipeline (~54), we have approximately 122 units of real inventory. With a target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods at a demand of ~55 per period, we need roughly 165 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 364 'In-transit' units from the calculated base stock, which would result in zero orders. To prevent this stockout, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock target by the 310 ghost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = ((L+1) * 55) + 310 = (3 * 55) + 310 = 165 + 310 = 475. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect recent variability (1-3 periods).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (mean ~48 units/period over the last 7 weeks) following the July peak. There is a persistent discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory: historical data confirms that orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P17 (totaling 310 units) are lost, yet they remain in the pipeline count. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (422) from the base stock. To compensate for this 310-unit 'ghost' inventory and ensure the system actually places orders when needed, I am using the 'explicit' method. I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (48 * 3) + 310 = 454. This overrides the backend's subtraction of the 310 lost units, effectively resetting the decision logic to focus on the 39 units on-hand and 112 units (422-310) of truly active pipeline (P30, P31, P32). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect current moderate volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 506098007 has stabilized at a lower level following the July peak. Over the last 5 periods (P28-P32), the mean demand is approximately 41 units per period (57, 49, 39, 29, 31). The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 359 units is heavily skewed by 310 units of 'ghost' inventory (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) which are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. The actual effective pipeline is only 49 units (Order P31 at 58 was received in P32, so remaining in-transit should be P32's 13 units and any other recent valid orders). Currently, on-hand inventory is 84 units, which combined with the effective pipeline is sufficient for the near term. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 359 units in transit and stopping all ordering, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 41 units and a lead time of 2. Formula: Base Stock = (L+1) * mean + z * sigma. With L=2, mean=41, and sigma~12, Base Stock \u2248 123 + 1.28 * 21 \u2248 150. I set mu_hat to 460 to offset the 310 ghost units (150 + 310 = 460). This ensures the backend perceives a need for stock despite the phantom 310 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed at ~41 units/period over the last 5 weeks (September cooling). Ghost inventory remains at 310 units, requiring explicit parameter inflation to trigger necessary replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked sharply to 142 units from a previous steady mean of ~40, causing a stockout. This spike may indicate a transition into a higher demand regime (early autumn sales). On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory of 394 units is heavily distorted by 310 confirmed 'ghost' units (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). The actual effective pipeline is only 84 units (Order P32: 13, P33: 35, and Order P19/P20 residual 35-unit ghost logic? No, let's look at recent arrivals). Order P32 (13) and P33 (35) are the only valid units in transit. Total valid pipeline = 48 units. To force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 394 units from its base stock calculation) to place an order, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat'. Calculated base stock for (L+1)=3 periods should be ~240 (aiming for ~80/period to cover the recent spike and potential regime shift). To ensure the backend orders, mu_hat must exceed the 394 'In-transit' + current on-hand. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550 to ensure a substantial order is triggered to rebuild stock and meet the higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand spike detected (142 units in P33); monitoring for sustained regime shift from the ~40 avg. Ghost inventory remains 310 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17), requiring explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the SKU 506098007 shows a significant data discrepancy. The reported In-transit inventory is 620 units. However, based on the historical tracking of 'ghost' shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17), we know that 310 units are permanently lost and will never arrive. Furthermore, since Order P34 (226 units) was just placed and Order P33 (35 units) is in transit, the actual 'real' pipeline is roughly 261-274 units. The backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 620 units in transit and refuse to order, despite on-hand inventory being 0. To force a replenishment order that covers the current demand regime, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime has returned to a mean of approximately 65-70 units per period following the spike in P33. To bypass the 310-unit ghost inventory blockage, I calculate mu_hat as: Expected Demand over (L+1) periods + Ghost Inventory. With L=2, this is (3 * 70) + 310 = 520. Setting mu_hat to 520 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the non-existent units it 'thinks' are coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 310 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Reported 'In-transit' of 620 units is effectively only ~310 units. Demand is stabilizing around 65-70 units following the late September spike.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (2019-10-14), the product (women's lingerie) is experiencing a post-spike stabilization. Demand in P33 was a sharp outlier (142), but P34 and P35 (63, 44) suggest a return to an average mean of approximately 65-70 units. Inventory resolution is critical: the reported 'In-transit' of 607 units is heavily distorted by 310 confirmed 'ghost' units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17 are long overdue/lost). The 'effective' pipeline includes P33 (35 units), P34 (226 units), and P35 (0 units), totaling 261 units. Since the OR backend calculates orders as [Base Stock - In-transit], the presence of 310 ghost units prevents the system from placing necessary new orders. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target base stock by 310 units to neutralize these ghost units, while setting 'sigma_hat' to account for the recent demand volatility (P33-P35 std is high). I am using L=3 'explicitly' because recent arrival lead times (P30, P32, P35) have drifted to 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Validated effective pipeline is 261 units (P33, P34); ghost inventory remains 310 units. Demand mean is established at ~65 units following the late September outlier. Recent actual lead times (P30, P32, P35) confirm a shift to 3 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21), we face a critical zero-stock situation despite an inflated 'In-transit' count of 634 units. Our carry-over insights confirm that at least 310 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) are 'ghost' units from lost shipments. Furthermore, orders P34 (226 units, ordered 3 periods ago) and P36 (62 units) are the only functional pipeline. Historical lead times have shifted from 2 periods to 3 (confirmed by P32, P33, and P35 concluding with lead times of 2-3 periods). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 65 after the late September spike. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target; since 310 units of the reported 634 are non-existent, the backend under-orders. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 620 units. This is calculated as: Effective Target = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. With demand ~65 and L=3, the 4-period demand is 260. Adding the 310 ghost units and a safety buffer for volatility (sigma_hat explicit at 100), this forces the backend to cover the phantom gap and the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory remains 310 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Lead time consensus is 3 periods based on recent delivery lags. Effective pipeline consists of Order P34 (226 units) and P36 (62 units). Demand stabilized near mean 65/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. History shows demand has settled near mean ~60-65 since the late September spike of 142. The most recent demand (P37) was 40, but the previous few weeks reflect a stronger regime. I am utilizing N=5 for demand to catch this post-peak stabilization. Lead time is confirmed as L=3 based on the last three deliveries (P30, P32, P35). Total In-transit is reported as 705 units, but 310 units are 'ghost' inventory (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17) which will never arrive. The effective pipeline consists of Order P34 (226), P36 (62), P37 (71), and P26 (1) totaling 360 units. This creates a discrepancy of 345 units between reality and what the backend sees. Since the backend computes 'order = base_stock - in_transit', and in-transit is inflated by 345, I must inflate mu_hat by 345 to force an order. Base mu_hat for L=3 (4 periods of demand) at ~60/week is 240. Inflated mu_hat = 240 + 345 = 585.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Ghost inventory remains 310 units from early periods; however, Order P26 (1 unit) and Order P22 (excessive delay) also likely lost or already accounted for in arrival deviations. Total persistent discrepancy between system 'In-transit' and actual expected arrivals is ~345 units. Demand regime mean is ~60 units/period (last 5 periods).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 60 units/period over the last 5 weeks (excluding the late September spike). The system reports 634 units in-transit, but our tracking confirms a 'ghost' pipeline of ~345 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P22, P26). The effective pipeline consists primarily of P34 (226 units) and P36 (62 units), totaling 288 units. Order P34 is currently 5 periods old, which is well beyond our recent lead-time observations of 1-3 periods, indicating it might also be delayed or lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 634 units from its order calculation, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we maintain inventory. Setting L to 3 (recent average) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand (60 units * (1+3) = 240) plus a buffer that accounts for the ghost inventory (345 units) ensures the backend actually triggers an order despite the inflated pipeline. We use periodic mean of 60 for sigma calculation over 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' discrepancy confirmed at ~345 ghost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P22, P26/27). Effective pipeline for Period 31 reflects only ~289 units (P34, P36).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 572 units. Based on historical data, there is a persistent discrepancy of ~345 'ghost' units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P22, P26, P27) that are long overdue and confirmed lost. The effective pipeline consists of Order P34 (226 units), which is now 6 periods since ordering and still hasn't arrived. If P34 is also lost, the situation is critical, but I will treat it as extremely delayed for one more period. Demand has stabilized at a mean of ~42 units/period (last 3 samples: 46, 30, 40). To override the OR backend's use of the inflated 572-unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=3) as (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 42 = 168. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 572 'In-transit' units, I set mu_hat to a value that, when compared to the pipeline, triggers replenishment. However, since the OR engine uses 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)', if pipeline (572) > base_stock, it orders 0. Thus, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to bypass the ghost inventory: mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) = 168 + 345 = 513. L is set to 3 to reflect recent delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: In-transit discrepancy confirmed at ~345 ghost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P22, P26, P27). Order P34 (226 units) is now 6 periods overdue, suggesting a potential increase in ghost inventory to 571 units if it doesn't arrive soon.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for this women's lingerie item remains in a low-demand phase (last 5 periods mean ~36). The system reports 'In-transit' as 572 units. However, previous carry-over insights confirm that 345 units are 'ghost' units (lost orders P1-P27). Crucially, Order P34 (226 units) is now 7 periods overdue (ordered in P34, current P41 start) and must be treated as lost, increasing total 'ghost' units to 571. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 1 unit (residual from early periods). With on-hand inventory at 35 and effective pipeline at 1, total usable inventory is 36. This is insufficient for a lead time of 3 periods at a stabilized demand of ~40 units. To bypass the OR backend's use of the inflated 572 'In-transit' value, I must explicitly set mu_hat to a high value that forces an order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+3)*40 + 571 = 731 to negate the ghost inventory impact and trigger a replenishment order of approximately 120-130 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory confirmed at 571 units. Order P34 (226 units) is 7 periods overdue and officially classified as lost. Effective pipeline is nearly zero.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 42 (late November). Historical analysis shows a significant discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory. Total 'ghost' units are now 571, including the recently confirmed loss of Order P34 (226 units, now 8 periods overdue). The systemic reported 'In-transit' of 747 includes these 571 lost units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 176 units (Order P41). Recent demand (P39-P41) has been very low (30, 22, 18), but the end of November and heading into December typically sees a seasonal rise for lingerie/fashion. The 5-period mean is ~23, but this represents a trough. I will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend ignores the 571 ghost units and places orders sufficient for a forecast of ~50 units/period (accounting for seasonal uptick) over a 4-period window (L+1=4). With an effective pipeline of 176 and on-hand 17 (Total 193), and a requirement of 4 * 50 = 200, a small top-up order is needed. I set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the internal subtraction of the 571 dead units by essentially 'inflating' the target stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 571 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34). System 'In-transit' is unreliable; effective pipeline is currently 176 units (Order P41). Demand is at a seasonal low but expected to rise entering December.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, we are entering the start of December. Historical data shows seasonal spikes in swimwear and lingerie often coincide with the holiday season and mid-year peaks; we observe on-hand inventory is at 0 units following a demand of 33 in P42. The system reports 814 units 'In-transit', but our carry-over analysis confirms 571 of these units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34). The effective pipeline consists of P41 (175 units) and P42 (67 units), totaling 242 units. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly assuming we are overstocked and blocking new orders, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~45 units/period (reflecting the late November average) and a lead time of 3 periods. To offset the 571 ghost units, I add them to the base stock calculation: (1+L)*demand + ghost = (4)*45 + 571 = 751. This ensures the backend emits an order to replenish stock for the coming holiday weeks.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (2019/12/09), demand remains low (Period 43 demand = 9) following a seasonal dip, but historical patterns suggest potential volatility or a year-end spike. The system 'In-transit' figure of 639 units is heavily distorted by long-standing 'ghost' inventory. Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P34 are confirmed lost, totaling 571 ghost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 68 units (Order P42 of 67 units + Order P26/27 residue). With 166 units on-hand and 68 units in the effective pipeline (Total 234), we are well-covered for the current low-demand regime (mean ~25-30) even with a lead time of 3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 571 ghost units and stopping all orders, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~35 units per period over a 4-period window (L+1), adjusted to offset the ghost inventory. mu_hat = (4 * 35) + 571 = 711. Sigma_hat is set to reflect moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 571 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34). Reported 'In-transit' remains highly unreliable.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019-12-16), demand is at a seasonal winter low (9 units in P43, 8 units in P44). Based on the product description (Push-up bras), we do not anticipate a significant Christmas spike, though mid-January usually sees a recovery. The primary challenge remains the 'in-transit' accounting. The system reports 639 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 571 of these units are confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 68 units (Order P42 of 67 units + 1 trailing unit). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 158 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 639 units and refusing to order more (as 639 units plus 158 on-hand far exceeds even peak seasonal demand), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I have set mu_hat to 625: this is derived by taking a safe cycle stock of ~50 units across a 4-period window (200 units) and adding back the 571 ghost units we need to 'cancel out' in the OR logic (200 + 571 = 771). However, since we have 158 on-hand and 68 real units in-transit (Total 226), setting mu_hat at 625 ensures the engine maintains a replenishment signal without creating extreme overstock. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect recent delivery delays.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '506098007' (Womens Lingerie) is currently in a late-December period. Historically, demand for this product saw a high peak in July (~120 units/period) and leveled off to ~60 in the fall. Recent samples (P43-P45) show a significant seasonal dip (9, 8, 20 units), which is typical for the weeks immediately surrounding Christmas in some retail categories, though a post-holiday rebound is likely. Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy at 205 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (572 units) is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P34), totaling 571 units. This means the actual effective pipeline is nearly zero. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) In-transit from its base stock calculation, it will likely not order anything even if demand rebounds. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate a forecasted demand of ~40 units/period for the next 4 periods (L+1 with L=3), but I must inflate this value by the 571 'ghost' units to force the backend to recognize the need for future replenishment as on-hand stocks deplete. Setting mu_hat to 731 (160 + 571) effectively neutralizes the ghost inventory. Lead time is set to 3 based on recent performance (P45 arrived in 3 periods).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status shows on-hand units at 188. Reported in-transit is 572 units, but based on carry-over insights, 571 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34), which are lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is essentially zero. Demand has entered a seasonal low post-December peak, with the last 4 periods showing values of 9, 8, 20, and 17 (mean ~13.5). However, looking at the same period last year (History start), demand was significantly higher (67, 71). Given the current on-hand of 188 and the low demand, no new order is required this period. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the OR backend does not trigger an order based on distorted data, setting the target based on the current low-demand observation while keeping the lead time at the recent consensus of 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: No change to ghost inventory (571 units). Demand remains in a seasonal trough (avg ~14 over the last 4 weeks). Effective pipeline remains near zero with no orders currently expected to arrive.
