Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a demand mean of 72.6 and standard deviation of 19.34. The product is 'Leggings/Tights', which is a staple item but may see a slight demand increase as the weather transitions into spring. Promised lead time is 2. The OR backend uses (1+L) for the review+lead time window, which reflects 3 weeks of demand coverage. Total demand (3 weeks) = 72.6 * 3 = 217.8. Sigma for 3 weeks = sqrt(3) * 19.34 \u2248 33.5. We will use the 'default' method for L to align with the promised lead time and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 (all available historical samples) to ensure the initial order base-stock is firmly rooted in the provided historical demand regime.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Examining the history for SKU 189616008 (Leggings), the promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 103 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2). On-hand inventory is 0, and we missed 63 units of demand in Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 - Feb 4) was 89, 42, 81, 71, and 80 (avg ~72.6). Combined with the Period 1 demand of 63, the overall mean is ~71. Since the product is 'Jersey Basic' leggings, demand is generally stable, but we are currently stock-out. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all 6 available data points (5 historical + Period 1) to stabilize the forecast, as there is no evidence yet of a seasonal shift or lead time deviation. With L=2, the backend will target covering demand for 3 periods (1 review + 2 lead time).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is a sturdy jersey legging, a staple item. Demand samples for the last 5 weeks are [89, 42, 81, 71, 80], and current game history demand is [63, 93], showing no major shift from the long-term average (approx 74). On-hand inventory is 0 because we started with 0 and the orders from P1 and P2 are still in transit. Promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution order, the order placed in P1 is scheduled to arrive during P3's arrival phase (after this decision). Following the 'L+1' lead time logic, we need to cover demand for P3, P4, and P5. I will set L to the default (2), use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the 5 pre-game samples plus 2 game history points) to capture the base demand level, and use the default for sigma_hat.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a basic jersey legging, which typically has steady demand but faces stockouts here as on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand samples (before systemic execution) were [89, 42, 81, 71, 80] with a mean of 72.6. Recent demand during game play (P1-P3) was [63, 93, 57], mean 71. These are consistent. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (103 units) should arrive during Period 3 (P1 + 2 = P3) and its arrival will be confirmed in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since we have 0 on-hand and 273 in-transit (P1: 103 + P2: 99 + P3: 71), and the P1 order is overdue, I will explicitly increase L to 3 to account for this delay. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the recent 8 samples (5 history + 3 game) which average ~72. Given L=3, the review+lead period covers 4 periods. mu_hat = (1+3)*72 = 288. sigma_hat will be based on the recent volatility of these 8 samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). History shows the SKU 189616008 (Leggings) has had persistent stockouts from periods 1-3 because the first order (Period 1) has not yet arrived, while the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2). The Period 1 order is now overdue (should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2), suggesting it may be a lost shipment. Customer demand has been relatively stable, averaging 71.4 units over the first 5 samples (including pre-game) and 76 units over the last 3 periods recorded in history. Given the potential loss of the Period 1 order (103 units), the current pipeline (246 units) includes that likely-lost shipment. To prevent under-ordering while accounting for the lost units, I will set L to the promised 2, use the most recent 5 demand samples (including pre-game data if available) to estimate mean demand, and use an explicit sigma_hat to maintain a safety buffer given the supply chain volatility (lost shipment).

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (103 units) is likely lost; it did not arrive by Period 4 despite a confirmed lead time of 2 periods for subsequent orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a basic legging. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) is: 89, 42, 81, 71, 80, 63, 93, 57, 80, 114. The mean demand is approximately 77 units. Recent demand in Period 5 spiked to 114, likely signaling a transition into spring seasonality for basics. Regarding inventory, we have 0 on-hand. In-transit units total 252 (Period 1: 103, Period 3: 71, Period 4: 72, Period 5: 6). As noted in carry-over insights, the Period 1 order (103 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order) and is considered lost. The Period 2 order arrived exactly at L=2. Therefore, the reliable pipeline consists of Period 3 (71), Period 4 (72), and Period 5 (6), totaling 149 units. Since the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit (252) from the base stock, it will underestimate the required order by the lost 103 units. To compensate, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that adds 103/ (1+L) to the expected demand across the lead time, ensuring the OR engine triggers an order to replace the lost stock. Base forecast (1+2)*85 = 255. Adjustment for lost units: 255 + 103 = 358. I will use a slightly higher sigma to account for the recent demand spike.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU 189616008 is a basic jersey legging, a stable item but currently facing inventory stockouts. Historical demand data (including pre-game samples) shows a mean of ~73 units/week. Recent periods (P4-P6) show an average of 87.6 units, indicating a slight upward trend. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 409 units, which includes: P1 (103 units - likely lost), P3 (71 units), P4 (72 units), and P6 (163 units). Order P2 arrived with L=2; Order P5 arrived with L=1. Actual lead time is fluctuating significantly. The loss of the P1 order has severely depleted our stock. Given the stockout and the inconsistency in lead times, I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering against the pipeline, but I will use a larger N for demand to capture recent higher volumes and use explicit sigma to account for higher volatility from both demand and shipping behavior.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P2 arrived in 2 periods, while P5 arrived in 1 period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The item is a 'Divided Basics' jersey legging. Historical demand shows a mean of 73 units/period (total mean) and ~81 units/period over the last 5 periods. Demand spiked in P5 (114) but has settled back to 67-69 in P6-P7. Lead time has shown volatility (2 periods for P2, 1 period for P5). We have a significant stockout situation: on-hand is 0, and we have 409 units in transit (ordered in P3: 71, P4: 72, P6: 163, P7: 0 - totaling 306 observed from history, but UI says 409, likely including a large recent order or adjustment). The P3 order (71 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P3, current P8), suggesting it may be lost like P1. To handle this, I will use a calculated lead time to reflect the average of 1.5, and apply an explicit mu_hat forecast. I will forecast demand based on the recent 5-period average (approx 81) multiplied by (1+L) where L=2 (promised), as we need to maintain higher target stock to recover from stockouts combined with lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (71 units) is likely lost; it has not arrived by P8 (expected P5/P6).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a jersey legging (basic category). Historical demand samples show a mean of ~73 units over 13 samples (combined pre-game and game history). Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 75.4. On-hand is 96, and in-transit is 246. However, looking at 'In-transit', we must reconcile: P1 (103) and P3 (71) are almost certainly lost as they are significantly past the promised (2) and observed (1-2) lead times. Subtracting these from in-transit (246 - 103 - 71) leaves only 72 units (ordered P4) currently viable in the pipeline. With a possible lost shipment scenario, pipeline inventory is lower than the OR backend perceives. I will set L to 2 (promised). Mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to capture current demand levels. Sigma_hat remains default based on the 8 samples from the game history.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: P1 (103 units) and P3 (71 units) confirmed lost as of Period 9. Only P4 order (72 units) remains valid in-transit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the inventory position for SKU 189616008 is 52 units on-hand. In-transit amounts to 246 units. Based on carry-over insights, orders from P1 (103 units) and P3 (71 units) are confirmed lost. The valid pipeline consists of P4 (72 units) and subsequent orders. Given the history, actual lead times range from 1 to 2 periods. The demand for 'Leggings/Tights' in April (Spring in many regions) shows a slight cooling compared to March peaks (averaging ~59 units over the last 3 samples vs ~83 units in the first 5 samples). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the more recent demand stabilization (~68.2 units per period). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead-time average (P2: 2, P5: 1, P6: 2), and set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

P4 (72 units) is extremely late (ordered P4, expected P6/P7), now at P11 it must be treated as lost to avoid an under-projected inventory state. The current in-transit of 246 units represents recent orders (likely from P10 or similar that aren't yet visible in history, but since ordered=0 for P7-P10, I must look closely at the in-transit field vs history which suggests a potential data gap or a large recent order invisible in the 'conclude' logs). I observe a demand downtrend in the last 4 periods (67, 44, 35) following a peak of 114 in Period 5. The recent demand mean (last 4 periods) is ~53.3. Lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.67). I will use L=2 (promised) to be safe given the delivery reliability issues. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent cooling of demand while still accounting for variability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: P4 order (72 units) also confirmed lost; no arrivals seen by P11. Demand has cooled significantly from early spring levels, averaging ~50 units/period over the last month.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a cooling trend: initial spring demand (P4-P7) averaged 82.5 units, while the last 4 periods (P8-P11) have averaged 49 units. We are currently out of stock. Several past orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, which makes recent 'In-transit' figures unreliable. However, orders from P9, P10, and P11 were 0 units, and the current 'In-transit' of 246 units corresponds to orders that were never placed in the game history, suggesting a potential data reset or the OR backend carrying forward units that aren't expected to arrive. Given the promised lead time of 2 and observed lead times of 1-2 periods, I will set L to 2. To account for the cooling demand regime, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (avg ~49), resulting in a forecast of (1+2)*49 = 147. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to capture current volatility. This conservative base stock setting will trigger an order to replenish the empty on-hand stock and provide coverage for the lead time and review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~80 to ~49 (-38%) starting Period 8. Carry-over note: P1, P3, and P4 orders totaling 246 units are confirmed lost/ignored by the system arrival logic.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019-05-06). The product is long leg jersey leggings, which typically see a demand decrease as spring transitions into summer. The demand history confirms a regime shift starting around Period 8, with recent demand (Periods 8-12) averaging 48.8 units per period, down from the earlier average of ~80. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 246 units consists of orders from P1 (103), P3 (71), and P4 (72), all of which are confirmed lost as they are significantly past the promised (2 periods) and actually observed (1-2 periods) lead times. I will continue to use an 'explicit' L of 2 to ensure the OR engine recognizes these 246 units are not arriving, effectively zeroing out the perceived pipeline. Given the established lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean (~48.8 * (1+2) = 146.4) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5). Since there are no valid orders in transit, setting L explicitly to 2 will trigger a new order based on the current base stock calculation.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (2019/5/13). The SKU (Heavy jersey leggings) has transitioned from a high-demand spring regime (~75-80 units/period) to a lower-demand regime. Since Period 9, demand has averaged 42.6 units (44, 35, 50, 48, 36). On-hand inventory is 0, and current 'In-transit' quantity of 246 units represents confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4. These units will never arrive, but the OR backend still counts them towards the pipeline inventory. To force an order and replenish 'actual' on-hand stock, I must use the 'explicit' method to provide a mu_hat that exceeds this phantom pipeline. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the base stock covers 3 periods of demand. At the current demand rate of ~43 units/period, we need 129 units of 'real' coverage. Adding the 246 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to at least 375 to trigger an order of approximately 129 units and restore service. I will set mu_hat to 400 to ensure robust replenishment given the zero on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed 246 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4) are phantom pipeline inventory. mu_hat adjusted explicitly to ~400 to bypass this blockage and restore ordering.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The item is a core basic (Jersey Leggings) which has seen a demand cooling since the early spring peak. Average demand since Period 8 has stabilized at ~41 units/period (last 7 periods: 67, 44, 35, 50, 48, 36, 29). The 'In-transit' figure of 391 units is heavily inflated by 246 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4) and the P14 order of 145 units. Effective pipeline inventory is only 145 units. The OR engine uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). With on_hand=0 and pipeline=391, the engine sees 391 units. To force an order that covers the current demand regime (~40 units/period) for L+1=3 periods (system target ~120-130 units), mu_hat must be set high enough to offset the phantom 246 units. I will set mu_hat to 400 (explicit) to maintain pressure for replacement stock until the phantom inventory is cleared or the actual P14 order arrives. L is set to calculate (avg ~1.5) to reflect the recent variability (1-2 periods). sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=7 to reflect the lower volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Avg demand decreased from ~80 to ~41 starting Period 8. In-transit count (391) includes 246 phantom units from documented lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand has transitioned into a lower summer-period regime with an average of approximately 41 units over the last 8 periods (since Period 8). The total in-transit quantity of 436 includes 246 'phantom' units from confirmed lost shipments in Period 1 (103), Period 3 (71), and Period 4 (72). Because the backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, these lost units effectively block new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + safety stock. With L=2, the demand window is 3 periods. 3 * 41 = 123. To force an order despite 436 units in-transit, base stock must exceed 436. I will set mu_hat to 500. This provides a buffer to clear the 436 phantom units and ensure a fresh shipment arrives to meet the ~40 units/period demand once the Period 14 and 15 orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed 246 phantom units still present in pipeline; using explicit mu_hat > in-transit count to bypass ordering blockage and maintain service level during demand cooling (~41 units/period).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), the SKU 189616008 (Leggings) is facing a critical inventory shortage with 0 on-hand units, despite a cooling demand trend that has dropped from an early spring average of ~80 to a current average of ~38 units/period (mean of last 8 samples). A major complicating factor is the 'phantom pipeline' issue: shipments from P1 (103), P3 (71), and P4 (72) totaling 246 units are definitively lost but still occupy the system's in-transit count. Since the OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', these 246 units act as a blockage. Total in-transit is currently 534 units, where 534 - 246 = 288 units are actually expected (from P14, P15, and P16). These valid orders should begin arriving during this Period 17 arrival phase. To ensure the backend places orders to cover future demand despite the phantom blockage, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock sufficient for (L+1)=3 periods of demand: 3 periods * 38 units/period + buffer + 246 (to offset ghosts) \u2248 420. However, to maintain a continuous inflow while we wait for arrivals, I've set mu_hat at 600 units (explicitly) and a heightened sigma_hat of 120 (explicitly) to force an order and bridge the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling sustained: Avg demand for Leggings decreased from ~80 to ~38 units/period starting P9. Pipeline contains 246 phantom units (P1, P3, P4) that will not arrive; OR parameters must be adjusted upwards explicitly to bypass this blockage until the in-transit count clears.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/10. The demand for leggings has cooled significantly, averaging ~30 units/period over the last 9 weeks (P9-P17). Total in-transit inventory is 655 units, but this includes 246 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4). Recent arrivals (P15 and P16 orders arrived in P17) indicate the actual lead time is functioning at 1-2 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 127 units, which covers over 4 weeks of the current demand regime (~30 units/week). My primary objective is to stop ordering to allow the high on-hand and remaining valid in-transit supply (P14: 145 units, P17: 264 units) to be consumed, as the total valid pipeline (+on-hand) is now ~536 units, which is excessive for a 30-unit/week demand. I will set mu_hat to a low explicit value to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in zero orders, effectively clearing the overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Leggings stabilized at a lower mean of ~30-35 units/period (P9-P17). Effective pipeline inventory (excluding 246 phantom units) is now high (536 units on-hand/valid in-transit), necessitating a pause in ordering to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), the item (Leggings) remains in a low-demand regime. Analyzing samples since Period 9 (the identified shift), the mean demand is approximately 34 units/period. The on-hand inventory is 100 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 655 units. Crucially, as documented in previous periods, 246 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost shipments that have not arrived for over 10 periods. The remaining 'valid' pipeline consists of the P14 order (145 units) and the P17 order (264 units), totaling 409 units. Effective inventory (on-hand 100 + valid in-transit 409) is 509 units. This covers over 14 periods of demand at current rates (~34/week). Therefore, no new orders are needed. The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from its target. To prevent any new orders until this surplus is cleared, mu_hat is set to a value significantly below the pipeline count (including the phantom units) using a recent_N method focused on the current low-demand regime (N=10).

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Effective inventory (509 units) is significantly higher than required for the current demand regime (~34 units/period), confirmed high holding risk until surplus is depleted.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we are managing a major overstock situation. Current on-hand inventory is 87 units and valid in-transit inventory is 409 units (totaling 496 units). This includes 145 units from Period 14 and 264 units from Period 17, which are currently within the lead-time arrival window. Historical data shows demand for these heavy jersey leggings has cooled significantly since April, stabilizing at a much lower mean of ~27 units/period (avg of last 10 samples). The current effective inventory of 496 units covers roughly 18 periods of demand, while the system's pipeline inventory also counts 246 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4), bringing the total tracked in-transit to 655. Given the high holding cost and the massive surplus relative to the current demand regime, the priority is to stop all new ordering to allow inventory depletion. I have set mu_hat to a very low explicit value (1) to ensure the base stock calculation remains well below the current pipeline levels, forcing a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Inventory surplus confirmed: Current effective units (496) cover ~18 periods of demand at the established ~27 units/period mean. Total tracked in-transit (655) still contains 246 phantom units from documented lost shipments in P1, P3, and P4.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the demand for heavy jersey leggings has transitioned into a summer low season, with the mean demand over the last four periods falling to approximately 18 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 72 units, which provides a cover of about 4 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 655 units remains highly distorted by 246 phantom units (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4) and the large P17 order of 264 units, which is currently in its expected arrival window. Given that total pipeline inventory (even after accounting for phantom units) is over 400 units, and the current demand is very low, any additional ordering would lead to excessive holding costs. The strategy is to maintain a 'zero order' state by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to minimal levels (reflecting the current low-demand regime and high inventory position) and allowing the backend to capitalize on the existing surplus until the system naturally requires replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Summer season low confirmed: Demand mean dropped to ~18 units/period (P17-P20). Massive inventory surplus (400+ valid units) relative to current seasonal demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is heavy jersey leggings (189616008), currently in the summer season (July 8th). Demand has continued to decline significantly, dropping to single digits in the most recent period (9 units). From Period 17-21, the average demand is 16 units/period, confirming a deep seasonal low. The inventory situation is heavily oversupplied: on-hand inventory is 63 units, which alone covers ~4 periods of current demand. Additionally, while the system shows 655 units in-transit, 246 of these are confirmed phantom units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4). Even excluding phantoms, there are 409 valid units in the pipeline (including the P14/P17 massive orders), providing months of coverage. Ordering must remain paused to minimize holding costs while this surplus is depleted. I am setting parameters to reflect the low-demand regime and prevent any new orders from being triggered by the phantom-heavy pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal trough confirmed: demand dropped to ~16 units/period mean (P17-P21). Massive valid inventory surplus (400+ units) ensures months of coverage; ordering is paused.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the Leggings SKU remains in a summer seasonal trough with demand averaging ~16 units/period over the last 6 periods (P17-P22). On-hand inventory is 48 units, which, despite recent depletion, still provides approximately 3 periods of safety coverage at current low demand rates. More importantly, the system tracks 655 units in-transit. Excluding the 246 phantom units (P1, P3, P4) confirmed lost, there are still 409 valid units in the pipeline (specifically from orders in P14 and P17). These pending arrivals represent over 25 periods of supply relative to the current mean. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. The OR parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime and maintain a zero-order signal while this massive surplus of valid pipeline inventory is worked through. L is kept at default. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the recent N=6 periods to reflect the stabilized summer low.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, mid-summer, which is historically a low-demand period for 'Heavy jersey long leg' leggings. Demand has stabilized into a 'summer trough' regime, with a mean of ~15 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P19-P23: 13, 15, 9, 15, 24). On-hand inventory is 24 units, and 'In-transit' is 655 units. However, per carry-over insights, 246 of these units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed phantom/lost. The remaining valid pipeline contains 409 units (mostly from P14 and P17 orders). Calculated effective inventory is roughly 433 units (24 on-hand + 409 valid in-transit). At the current demand rate of ~15/period, this covers nearly 29 periods. No new orders are needed. L is set to 'default' (2). mu_hat is set to the current regime mean (~15) * (1+L) = 45. sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value to reflect the stable, low-demand summer trough and prevent the OR engine from ordering against the massive surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory has decreased to 12 units. According to game history, an order of 145 units was placed in Period 14 and an order of 264 units was placed in Period 17. Given the promised lead time of 2, these are significantly overdue. However, in Period 17, we saw arrivals from P15 and P16, suggesting the logistics system is processing more recent orders while potentially losing older ones, or that the 'In-transit' count of 655 is heavily inflated by phantom inventory (246 units confirmed lost in P1, P3, P4, plus the missing 145 from P14 and 264 from P17). Current demand is in a summer seasonal trough, averaging ~15-20 units/period (P21-P24 mean = 15). With 12 on-hand, we are at risk of stockout next period. However, given the massive 'In-transit' figure (655 units vs a total mean demand of ~15), the OR backend will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is set explicitly above the pipeline count. I will set mu_hat to 700 to force an order that covers the immediate stock-out risk, effectively bypassing the 655 units of likely lost/stalled pipeline inventory. Lead time is set to 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Pipeline 'In-transit' count (655) is significantly desynchronized from actual arrivals; 145 units (P14) and 264 units (P17) are now suspected lost or severely delayed alongside the original 246 phantom units. Total likely phantom pipeline is 655 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 189616008 is currently facing a severe inventory and logistics crisis. The 'In-transit' count of 704 units is almost entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (103), P3 (71), P4 (72), P14 (145), and P17 (264), totaling 655 units. These units will not arrive, leaving only the P25 order (49 units) as potentially valid in-transit. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has settled into a low summer regime, averaging approximately 15 units/period (P21-P25 mean = 15). To bypass the OR backend's ordering blockage caused by the 704 phantom in-transit units and restore service level, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly higher than the current 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' count. A base stock target of roughly 800 units (mu_hat = 800) is used to force an order that compensates for the lost 655 units and targets a safety stock for the current demand regime. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative phantom pipeline confirmed at 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). These orders are lost and will not arrive. Summer demand regime confirmed at ~15 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/8/12), we are entering the mid-August window. Historic demand for this heavy jersey legging showed a cooling period throughout the summer (averaging ~18 units/period from P17-P24), but the last two periods have seen a slight uptick (24, 12, 15, 33), indicating the typical late-August/early-September 'back to school' ramp-up may be beginning. The pipeline situation is critical: the 'In-transit' count of 816 units is heavily inflated by 655 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). This leaves a valid pipeline of 161 units (49 from P25, 112 from P26). With on-hand inventory at 0 and demand starting to recover, we must maintain ordering. However, to bypass the 655 phantom units, mu_hat must be set explicitly higher than the phantom total plus the required safety stock. I will set mu_hat to 850 units (approx. 655 phantom + 195 to cover the upcoming 3 periods of demand at a projected 65 units/period for late August). This ensures the OR backend places an order to bridge the gap without being paralyzed by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand recovery beginning: mean demand increasing from summer trough of ~15 to ~25-30 as of P26. Total cumulative phantom pipeline confirmed at 655 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. We are entering the late-August back-to-school season. Historical demand for these heavy jersey leggings dropped to a summer mean of ~15 units, but the last two periods show an uptick (33 and 24 units), signaling a seasonal recovery. The pipeline inventory (826 units) is heavily distorted by phantom shipments. Based on history, orders from P1 (103), P3 (71), P4 (72), P14 (145), and P17 (264) are confirmed lost/ignored, totaling 655 phantom units. Valid in-transit units are from P26 (112) and P27 (59), plus current on-hand (25), totaling 196 actual units. At a projected mean of ~30 units/period, we have ~6 periods of coverage. However, the OR backend sees 826 in-transit + 25 on-hand = 851 units. To force necessary orders while accounting for phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly high (at 950) to offset the 655 unit blockage, ensuring the base-stock exceeds the reported pipeline enough to sustain the service level as demand rises further in autumn.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Seasonal demand recovery confirmed (mean ~25-30 units). Total cumulative phantom pipeline confirmed at 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). These units appear in 'In-transit' but will never arrive; mu_hat must be inflated to bypass this blockage.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late August (2019/8/26), entering the Peak Back-to-School season for leggings. Demand has recovered from a summer low of ~15 units/period to a recent regime of ~25-30 units/period (last 3 periods: 33, 24, 30). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' count of 949 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (103), P3 (71), P4 (72), P14 (145), and P17 (264), totaling 655 phantom units. Valid pipeline inventory includes P26 (112), P27 (59), and P28 (123), totaling 294 units. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the OR engine uses (base_stock - In-transit) to determine the order, a mu_hat significantly greater than the phantom 'In-transit' count (655) is required to trigger any new orders. To maintain service levels during this seasonal upturn while bypass the 655-unit blockage, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1100. This provides approximately 3 periods of coverage (L=2) at an anticipated seasonal demand of ~35-40 units/period, while accounting for the 655 phantom units (1100 - 655 = 445 effective base stock).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Cumulative phantom pipeline confirmed at 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). Historical demand for this period in 2018 (or nearest sample) suggests 40-80 units, aligning with Back-to-School seasonality.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02, entering the peak of the Back-to-School season for leggings. Demand has recovered from the summer trough (mean ~15) to a current mean of ~30-35, with a visible upward trend (P29 demand: 37). Historically, demand for this SKU can spike to 80+ units in autumn weeks. The 'In-transit' count of 1150 is heavily inflated by 655 'phantom units' (Orders P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which have been confirmed lost over multiple periods. To maintain stock as on-hand is currently zero, I must set mu_hat high enough to bypass the 1150-unit pipeline blockage. I estimate a seasonal demand mean of 45-50 for the (L+1) window. Applying (L+1)*mean = (2+1)*50 = 150 target, plus the 1150 phantom/blocked value, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1350. This ensures the OR backend places an order to satisfy the 3-period demand window despite the stale pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed cumulative phantom pipeline remains 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). Seasonal demand recovery is accelerating: P29 demand at 37 vs. summer mean of 15 (+146%). Anticipating further increases as autumn progresses.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (Sept 9), we are seeing the expected 'Back-to-School' and early autumn demand recovery. Demand has increased from a summer low of ~15 to 47 in P30. Historical context (Jan samples around 40-90) and the recent uptrend suggest demand will continue to rise toward 60-80 units/period as we enter the cooler months. Pipeline management remains the primary challenge: There is a cumulative 'phantom' pipeline of 655 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) that artificially inflates the 'In-transit' count to 1243. The actual valid pipeline is 655 units lower (1243 - 655 = 588 units, consisting of orders from P26, P29, and P30). With on-hand inventory at 135 units and demand rising, we must ensure the OR backend continues to place orders despite the phantom blockage. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1400 (roughly (1+L) * 466) to ensure the total base stock target (on-hand + valid in-transit) remains high enough to trigger replenishment as the seasonal peak approaches. This value effectively treats the 655 phantom units as 'already used' and targets a healthy stock level for the autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Autumn demand scaling confirmed; demand reached 47 units (+213% from summer trough). Valid pipeline is approximately 588 units, while 655 units remain recorded as phantom/lost 'In-transit' inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16), demand for leggings is in a seasonal upswing (Autumn/Back-to-School), rising from a summer low of ~15 to a recent mean of ~43 units/period over the last 5 weeks (33, 24, 30, 37, 47, 56). Historical context suggests demand will continue to climb. The 'In-transit' count of 1290 is heavily distorted by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P1 (103), P3 (71), P4 (72), P14 (145), and P17 (264), totaling 655 phantom units. Recent arrivals (P27 in 3 periods, P28 in 2 periods) suggest actual lead time is oscillating around the promised 2 periods; I'll use L=2. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1290 units 'in-transit', mu_hat must be set explicitly higher than the current effective pipeline. Total recorded in-transit (1290) - Phantom (655) = 635 valid units in pipeline. On-hand is 79. Total valid inventory = 714. However, with demand accelerating and a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I want to maintain a healthy stock. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1500 to overcome the 1290 in-transit blockage and trigger a replenishment order to capture the growing autumn demand, while sigma_hat is increased to account for lead-time volatility observed in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Cumulative phantom pipeline confirmed at 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). Autumn demand acceleration confirmed: 5-week mean is ~43, up from summer mean of 15 (+186%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (Sept 23) shows the product is in an autumn demand surge following the summer trough. Recent demand (P28-P32) has averaged ~41 units. The pipeline 'In-transit' count of 1346 is heavily inflated by 655 units of documented phantom inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17 confirmed lost). Subtracting these 655 phantom units from the 1346 in-transit gives an 'effective' in-transit of 691. Adding the current on-hand of 366 results in a total effective inventory of 1057 units. At the current demand rate of ~41 units/period, this is approximately 25 periods of coverage. Even with potential demand growth toward a winter/holiday peak (which reached ~90-110 units in Feb/Mar), the current stock levels are extremely high and pose a significant holding cost risk. No further orders are needed at this time. I will use a conservative mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (Autumn regime) while keeping lead time at the promised 2 periods to avoid triggering the OR backend's ordering logic while overhead remains so high.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Effective inventory (On-hand + non-phantom In-transit) is ~1057 units, providing excessive coverage (25+ periods) for the current autumn regime (~41 units/period). Maintain ordering pause to deplete surplus.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 34 (Sept 30, 2019). We are in the autumn demand regime for leggings, with demand averaging ~49 units over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), peaking at 71 units last period. The 'In-transit' count (1346) is severely inflated by phantom/lost orders: P1(103), P3(71), P4(72), P14(145), P17(264), and now potentially P26(112), which is overdue (ordered P26, lead time is usually 1-2 periods), and P29(201), which is also overdue (ordered P29, promised 2). If P26 and P29 are lost, phantom inventory equals 1068 units. Valid inventory includes On-hand (295) and the P32 order (378), totaling 673 units. At a mean demand of ~50, 673 units provide ~13 weeks of cover. The OR backend will not order because 'In-transit' (1346) far exceeds any reasonable base stock ($ \approx 3 \times 50$). To avoid excessive holding costs on the already large 673 units of valid inventory, I will maintain default parameters to keep the order at 0 until the surplus is depleted.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07 (Period 35). Demand for Leggings has transitioned from the summer trough (~15 units/period) to an autumn regime, averaging ~50 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P30-P34). The 'In-transit' figure of 1346 is significantly inflated by 655 phantom units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 691 units. Adding on-hand inventory (226), the total effective inventory is 917 units. At the current demand rate of ~50, this provides approximately 18 periods of coverage. Although the autumn trend is upward, the current surplus is more than sufficient to cover the promised lead time (2) plus a safety buffer. I will continue the ordering pause to allow on-hand inventory to deplete toward more efficient levels, thereby reducing holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~50 units/period (P30-P34), up from summer mean of 15. Total effective inventory (On-hand + non-phantom In-transit) is ~917 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the leggings SKU is in a stable autumn demand regime. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is approximately 57.5 units/period. The current inventory status shows 537 units on-hand and 968 units in-transit. However, historical reconciliation (Carry-over insights) confirms that 655 units of the 'In-transit' figure are 'phantom' units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) that will never arrive. The effective inventory is therefore: On-hand (537) + Valid In-transit (968 - 655 = 313) = 850 units. At the current demand rate of ~58 units/period, 850 units provide approximately 14.6 periods of coverage. Given the lead time is ~2 periods, we are significantly overstocked. No new orders are needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current autumn stabilized demand level, and keep L at 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead time performance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: mean demand for P30-P35 is ~58 units/period. Effective inventory (On-hand + non-phantom In-transit) is 850 units, providing ~14 weeks of coverage.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '189616008' (Leggings) is currently in an autumn demand regime with a mean of approximately 58 units/period (P30-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 508 units. The recorded 'In-transit' count of 968 units is highly inflated due to 655 units of documented phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17). Subtracting these phantoms, the actual pipeline is 313 units (ordered P26, P29). Total effective inventory (On-hand 508 + Valid In-transit 313) is 821 units. At the current demand rate, this provides ~14 weeks of coverage. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $19.0, we must maintain sufficient stock, but 14 weeks is excessive. We will continue the ordering pause to allow on-hand inventory to deplete and for the 'In-transit' figure to reconcile as those specific old orders are eventually cleared or aged out by the system logic. No new orders are needed this period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the autumn demand regime for leggings, which has stabilized at a mean of ~58 units/period over the last 8 weeks (P30-P37). On-hand inventory is 467 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 968 units is heavily inflated by 655 phantom units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17). Excluding these phantom units, the valid pipeline is actually 313 units (P26=112 units, P29=201 units). Total effective inventory (On-hand 467 + Valid In-transit 313) is 780 units. At the current demand rate of ~58, this provides ~13.4 weeks of coverage. Lead time remains volatile (fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods). Given the significant surplus relative to the current regime and the approaching end of the autumn peak, I will continue to pause ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. No parameter changes are needed to force orders at this time as the surplus is still melting down.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: mean demand for P30-P37 is ~53 units/period. Effective inventory (On-hand + non-phantom In-transit) is 780 units, providing ~14 weeks of coverage. Total cumulative phantom pipeline remains confirmed at 655 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in the late autumn demand regime for leggings, with a mean demand of ~53 units/period over the last 9 weeks (P30-P38). The recorded 'In-transit' inventory is 968 units, but 655 of these are confirmed phantom units from lost or severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). Subtracting these phantoms, the effective pipeline is 313 units. Combined with 431 units on-hand, total effective inventory is 744. At the current demand mean, this gives ~14 weeks of coverage. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~2. Since effective inventory is well above the base stock required for a 3-period coverage (~160-200 units), I will continue to maintain an ordering pause by setting parameters that do not trigger new orders against the inflated 'In-transit' count. No changes to phantom status or demand regime are needed as the surplus is still being worked down.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for Leggings has stabilized in an autumn regime averaging ~46 units/period (P30-P39), significantly lower than the early spring peak but higher than the summer trough. The system reports 968 units in-transit, but 655 units are confirmed phantom units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) that will never arrive. The actual effective pipeline is 313 units (P26=112, P29=201). Adding the 390 units on-hand, total effective inventory is 703 units. At a demand rate of ~46 units/period, this provides ~15 weeks of coverage. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~2. Given the massive inventory surplus relative to current demand and the confirmed phantom inventory blockage, I will continue to keep OR parameters at values that prevent new orders (L=default, mu_hat/sigma_hat set to recent low activity to reflect current stabilization) until on-hand levels deplete further.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime stabilized: mean demand for P30-P39 is ~46 units/period. Total effective inventory (On-hand + non-phantom In-transit) is ~703 units, confirmed cumulative phantom pipeline remains 655 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The autumn demand regime for Leggings has stabilized, with recent demand over the last 10 periods (P31-P40) averaging ~41 units/period. The pipeline inventory of 968 units remains heavily skewed by 655 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) which are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The actual valid inventory consists of 359 units on-hand and 313 units in-transit (P26=112, P29=201). Total effective inventory is 672 units. At a mean demand of ~41 units, this provides approximately 16 periods of coverage. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $19.0, maintaining this surplus is inefficient, and no new orders should be placed. I will continue the ordering pause to allow on-hand levels to deplete toward the target safety stock levels. Parameters are set to reflect the current stable demand regime (~41 units/period) while accounting for the phantom inventory blockage by keeping mu_hat below the reported In-transit levels.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25 (Period 42). We are managing a Leggings SKU with a current demand mean of ~42 units/period (P35-P41), slightly down from the early autumn peak. On-hand inventory is 327 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 968 units is highly inflated due to cumulative phantom inventory (lost shipments). Based on Carry-Over Insights, 655 units (from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) are confirmed lost. Subtracting 655 from 968 leaves 313 potentially valid units in transit. Total valid coverage (On-hand 327 + valid In-transit 313) = 640 units. At a mean demand of 42, this covers ~15 periods. As the game ends at Period 47 (5 periods remaining), we have sufficient stock to cover all remaining demand without further ordering. I will continue to use the default 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand to keep the parameters responsive, while allowing the existing surplus to deplete. No new orders will be triggered by the OR backend because current inventory exceeds the base stock level calculated from these parameters.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/02 (Period 43). We are entering the peak December holiday season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 84 units, significantly higher than the previous autumn mean of ~43, indicating the start of a winter/holiday surge for leggings. On-hand inventory is 243 units. The 'In-transit' count of 968 units is heavily distorted by 655 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) and likely including the large 201 units from P29 which is reaching overdue status (14 weeks since order). Excluding the 655 confirmed phantom units, the 'effective' in-transit is 313. Total effective inventory (On-hand 243 + Valid In-transit 313) is 556 units. With demand accelerating (recent peak 84), we need to ensure the OR backend doesn't block ordering due to the phantom units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the holiday surge (forecast ~90 units/period) across the lead time (3 periods total), while adjusting it high enough to potentially trigger a small order if the backend realizes effective stock is dipping relative to high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Holiday demand surge confirmed; Period 42 demand (84) represents a ~100% increase over the autumn mean. Total cumulative phantom pipeline remains 655 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $937.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), in the middle of the holiday season. Recent demand (P42: 84, P43: 59) confirms a surge from the autumn mean of ~45 to a holiday peak. The current in-transit inventory of 1104 units includes 655 phantom units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, and P17) which have been confirmed lost over multiple periods but remain on the books. This leaves a valid pipeline of 449 units (the P29 order of 201 units, the P32 order of 112 units which might be delayed/lost, and the recent P43 order of 136 units). Effective inventory is On-hand (184) + Valid In-transit (449) = 633 units. With demand spiking, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' to account for both the phantom inventory blockage and the anticipated holiday demand. I estimate demand at ~85 units/period for the next 3 weeks (L+1). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1104 in-transit, I need a 'mu_hat' that exceeds the total in-transit + on-hand buffer. Setting mu_hat to 1350 (targeting ~15 periods of coverage or effectively bypassing the 655 phantom units to maintain a 700-unit target) to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday demand peak confirmed (avg ~72 over last 2 weeks). Total cumulative phantom pipeline remains 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). Effective inventory calculation must subtract 655 from reported In-transit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing the late holiday and end-of-year sales transition. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 84 (Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact), but has since moderated to ~43 over the last two weeks. Total recorded In-transit is 1413 units. This includes 655 units confirmed as lost/phantom (Orders P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). Subtracting these, the valid pipeline is 758 units (P43, P44, and potentially P26/P29/P31 if those are still outstanding). Given the 2018 samples and recent trends, we expect demand to remain elevated but stabilize or slightly decline as we approach January. Current inventory (156) plus valid in-transit (758) = 914 units, which covers ~12-14 weeks at the current holiday/autumn mean (~65 units). No further ordering is required to avoid high holding costs as the season winds down. Parameters are set to ensure the base stock remains below the reported (inflated) in-transit count to maintain the ordering pause.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Valid pipeline is 758 units (reported 1413 minus 655 phantom). Total effective inventory (On-hand + valid In-transit) of ~914 units provides sufficient coverage for the remainder of the holiday season and the early January trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5548.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Leggings' in late December (Period 45) spiked massively to 342, likely representing a pre-holiday liquidation or clearing event before the Christmas/New Year week. Period 46 starts with 0 on-hand inventory. The reported 'In-transit' of 1277 units contains 655 'phantom' units (confirmed lost in previous periods P1, P3, P4, P14, P17). This leaves a valid pipeline of 622 units (1277 - 655). The Period 44 order of 309 units is expected to arrive in Period 46 (this period) or 47, but will not be visible until the next period. After the massive Period 45 spike, demand typically drops significantly in late December/early January. Given the current pipeline of 622 units (which is ~10x recent average demand excluding the outlier), and the fact that 0 on-hand inventory will lead to stockouts this week, the priority is to wait for the valid pipeline to arrive rather than over-ordering during a post-seasonal cooling. I will continue to use explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR logic doesn't block due to the 655 phantom units, but keep values moderate as the valid pipeline is substantial.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Period 45 demand spike (342) is a seasonal outlier. Valid pipeline identified at 622 units (Reported in-transit 1277 - 655 phantom units). Effective coverage remains high despite current 0 on-hand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand has spiked massively in the last two periods (342 and 210 vs. previous average of ~50), likely due to post-holiday sales or specific end-of-year clearing for this legging SKU. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported 'In-transit' is 1277 units. However, as documented in previous periods, 655 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17) are phantom inventory/lost shipments that will never arrive. The valid pipeline consists of the P44 order (309 units). Subtracting the 655 phantom units from the 1277 reported 'In-transit' leaves 622 units, but only the 309 from P44 is a reliable upcoming arrival. Given the high demand spikes, we must ensure the OR backend places an order. Because the 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by the 655 lost units, a standard mu_hat based on the current regime (approx 150-200/period) would be less than the 'In-transit' count, resulting in zero ordering. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to 1000. This value is calculated to exceed the phantom pipeline (655) plus one period of high demand (~300), effectively forcing the backend to reconcile the inventory gap and place an order to cover the January demand before the seasonal trough returns.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Valid pipeline confirmed at only 309 units (P44 order). Total phantom 'In-transit' units remain 655. Sustained end-of-year demand surge (avg 276 over P45-P46) has depleted all on-hand inventory.
