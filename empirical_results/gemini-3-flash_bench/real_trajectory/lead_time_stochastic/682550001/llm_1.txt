The peak of 110 on 2019-01-21 might be related to post-holiday sales or a specific local event. For the current date (Feb 11), demand is expected to remain relatively stable as we are in the tail end of winter/early spring transition, which is good weather for hoodies. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need enough stock to satisfy demand through Period 3. Using an average of 55 units per period, the target pipeline is ~165 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will order 170 units to establish base stock and account for potential variance.",

On-hand inventory is currently 0, and 170 units are in-transit (ordered P1, expected P3 or P4). Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, making it available for sale in Period 4. I need to cover demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4 to maintain stock, as a 170-unit order is currently in the pipeline. Total units needed to cover demand for P2-P4 (at ~50 units/period) is ~150 units. Since 170 units are already in-transit, I am technically covered for the immediate lead-time window. However, current on-hand is 0, so I will lose sales in P2 and likely P3 until the P1 order arrives.

According to the timeline, the P1 order (170 units) should arrive DURING P3 and be visible at the start of P4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0.

  "rationale": "Product 682550001 (Uno Hood) is a mid-weight jersey hoodie. World knowledge suggests mid-May demand (Period 14) for light outerwear should be stable or slightly declining as temperatures rise, before summer lows. Recent demand (P9-P13) has averaged approximately 43 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 400. However, cumulative historical analysis and previous carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (170 units), P3 (50 units), and P4 (50 units) are lost, totaling 270 'phantom' units. Thus, the real reliable pipeline is 400 - 270 = 130 units. Specifically, this 130 includes P10 (100) and P13 (30). Since P10 was ordered 4 periods ago and the observed lead time is 1-2 periods, P10 is now also highly suspect or significantly delayed. On-hand inventory is 22. With expected demand around 45-50, current stock will be exhausted this period. To bridge the gap until P10 (if it arrives) or new orders arrive (L=2), I need to cover Period 14, 15, and 16 demand (~150 units). Current visible reliable stock is 22 (on-hand) + 30 (P13 in-transit) = 52.

Lead time analysis: Orders from P1 (170), P3 (50), P4 (50), and now likely P10 (100) are lost or indefinitely delayed, as they are 2-12 periods past the promised lead time of 2.

Historical demand for the most recent month (Oct/Nov) has stabilized around an average of 88 units per period, consistently higher than the early-year baseline of ~45. Current on-hand inventory is 109 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1425 units is significantly inflated by 880 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Therefore, the actual reliable pipeline is 545 units (1425 - 880). The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P34 (275), P36 (150), P38 (100), and the current order. The P34 order (275 units) is now 5 periods old (exceeding promised L=2 by 3 periods) and has not arrived; while not yet definitively lost like the earlier ones, its absence creates a high risk of a supply gap if it fails. I will assume a demand of ~95 units for the next few periods. Total inventory needed for the L+1 window (3 periods) is ~285 units. On-hand (109) + Reliable In-transit (545) = 654 units. However, if P34 (275) is indeed lost, the reliable pipeline drops to 270 (379 total). Given the extreme supply chain instability and the high cost of stocking out ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost, but demand is peaking), I will place a conservative order of 100 to maintain a buffer against the potential loss of the P34 shipment and seasonal volatility.",
