Note the significant jump to 112 in the most recent week (2019-02-04), potentially signaling a seasonal shift toward spring/summer items like trainer socks. Based on an average around 80 and the recent spike, I will target enough inventory to cover (Lead Time + 1) periods of demand. Promised Lead Time = 2. Pipeline target: 3 periods * ~90 units/period = 270 units. Since current on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will place an initial order for 270 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand, keeping in mind that the first arrival won't happen until Period 3.",

Period 1 actual demand was 142 on 2019-02-11, showing a significant jump likely tied to pre-Valentine's Day shopping or seasonal transitions (spring stocking). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 270 units in transit (ordered P1, promised lead time 2, expected to arrive in Period 3). Since lead time L=2, my order in P2 must cover expected demand for P3 (L+1) and ensure stock doesn't run dry. Demand Analysis: The jump from ~80 to 142 is significant. I'll estimate future mean demand at ~110-120 to be safe, acknowledging P1 might be a peak. Pipeline Balance: On-hand(0) + In-transit(270) = 270. Expected demand for P2 (now) is ~120, and P3 is ~120. Total requirement for the next two periods is ~240. The current pipeline (270) covers this. However, I need to place an order now for Period 4 arrival. Order Calculation: Target Inventory level for L+1 periods (P2, P3, P4) plus safety stock. 3 periods * 120 demand = 360 units. Current pipeline is 270. Order needed = 360 - 270 + (Safety Stock of ~90) = 180 units. This ensures that even if demand stays at the high P1 level (142), I don't stock out.",

Historical data from early January/February showed demand around 60-112 units. However, current game history indicates a massive surge: Period 1 demand was 142 and Period 2 demand was 311.

{
  "rationale": "Product 372860002 is '7p Basic Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks'. Given the calendar date (early March), demand is surging as consumers transition to spring footwear (sneakers/trainers). Historical demand from Jan-Feb averaged ~78, but the last three periods (Feb 11 - Feb 25) have seen demand spike to 142, 311, and 293 (avg ~248). No stock has arrived yet due to the 2-period lead time. Analysis of Pipeline: Period 1 order (270 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution (visible at P4 START) - however, the history shows Period 3 concluded with 0 arrived, implying a potential delay. However, per the 'Critical Timing Example', a lead time of 2 means an order placed in P1 arrives in P1+2=P3 and is first visible in the P3 conclude/P4 start message. The P3 conclude message says arrived=0. This suggests the P1 order is either delayed or the lead time is longer than 2. However, I must assume the system timing: P1 order arrives in P3 resolution. If it didn't show in P3 conclude, I expect it and the P2 order (180) to land soon. Total In-transit is 900 (270 + 180 + 450). Current On-hand is 0. Expected demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 300 * 3 = 900. Total Pipeline (0 on-hand + 900 in-transit) exactly covers the next 3 weeks of demand. To build a safety buffer against the stockouts already suffered and the high demand regime, I will place a moderate order to maintain the pipeline.",

Historical demand from the same time in Jan/Feb 2019 was ~60-80 units, and the most recent periods (P39-40) show a decline to ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently 19 units. Regarding the pipeline, total in-transit is 4420 units, but 4370 of these are confirmed/highly probable lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P34). The only actionable order in the pipeline is P38 (150 units) and P39 (250 units). P38 was ordered 3 periods ago and hasn't arrived (expected L=2), while P39 was ordered 2 periods ago. We expect P38 to arrive during Period 41 based on the recent 3-period lead time observed for P32, P33, P35, and P36. If P38 arrives, we will have 150 + 19 = 169 units available to cover Period 41 demand (forecasted ~90-110). However, given the inconsistency of arrivals and the current low on-hand stock, a small safety order is warranted to prevent a stockout if P38 is also lost or further delayed, while being mindful of the high holding cost ($1/unit) and the approaching end of the game (Period 47).",

The only valid in-transit order is P43 (300 units), expected to arrive in Period 45. Decision: On-hand is 81. Expected demand for P44 is ~100. The P43 order of 300 will cover demand for P45 and P46. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47), and a lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now in P44 would arrive in P46. Given the high holding cost ($1) and the fact that 300 units are already arriving to cover the final periods' low demand, no additional order is needed to maximize profit and minimize ending inventory.",

(b) Demand: Demand has stabilized at a winter floor of ~80-130 units. The most recent demand (P46) was 129 units and P45 was 116 units. (c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised L=2; actuals oscillate between 2-3 periods. System in-transit is 4320, but per Carry-over insights, at least 4370 + P38 (150) were confirmed lost.
