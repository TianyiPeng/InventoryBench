Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for an 'Essential Tanktop Lace'. Historically, demand samples for early Jan-Feb are: 92, 68, 85, 95, 64 (Mean: 80.8, Std Dev: 14.1). No previous orders have been placed (On-hand: 0, In-transit: 0). The product is a 'Womens Casual' jersey top, which usually sees stable demand in winter/early spring with potential increases as weather warms. Promised lead time (L) is 2. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (representing the available historical samples) to set initial targets. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) will target (1+2)*80.8 = 242.4 units, and sigma_hat will account for the historical volatility. This helps the OR engine calculate a 'Base Stock' to cover the 3-period risk horizon (review + lead time) immediately.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's casual jersey lace tank top. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) show a mean of 80.8 units per week (92, 68, 85, 95, 64). Period 1 demand was high (105), likely signifying the start of a seasonal transition towards spring/summer garments. The on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 104 units in-transit (ordered in P1). With a promised lead time of L=2, these units are expected in Period 3. To set OR parameters: 1) L=default (2 periods). 2) mu_hat: Using historical average (approx 80) plus the recent Period 1 evidence (105). N=6 (5 history + Period 1) gives a mean of 84.8. (1+L)*84.8 = 254.4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent spike while maintaining some stability. 3) sigma_hat: Standard deviation of all 6 points is approx 15. sqrt(1+2)*15 = 26. Using 'recent_N' for sigma as well.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 3 (2019/2/25), we are managing a women's lace tank top. The product is out of stock (On-hand: 0). On-hand inventory was 0 for Period 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales (Demand: 105 in P1, 163 in P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (104 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3, and the order from Period 2 (112 units) in Period 4. The total in-transit is 216 units. Demand is showing a significant upward trend (Historical: ~80; P1: 105; P2: 163), likely due to the approach of spring. To capture this growth while remaining robust against stockouts, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility, focusing on the most recent 3 samples (P2, P1, and the last historical sample) to project forward. This results in a higher mu_hat to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's casual vest top (tank top) with lace trims. We are currently in early March (Period 4). Historically, the demand samples from January/early February were relatively low (mean ~81). However, since Period 1 (mid-February), demand has spiked significantly (105, 163, 162), suggesting a seasonal shift towards spring/warm-weather wear. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (104 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the game history shows arrived=0 for Period 3, meaning the lead time is likely longer than 2 periods or the shipment is delayed. On-hand remains 0, leading to lost sales. To address the demand surge and the lead time reality, I will use a larger N for demand to capture the recent high-demand regime and set an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the delayed arrival of the P1 order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: avg demand increased from ~81 to ~143 (+76%) likely due to spring seasonality for women's vest tops; Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods (P1 order not yet arrived by P3 conclude).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lace vest top (spring/summer seasonal item). Current date is March 11. Historical demand for the last 4 periods (105, 163, 162, 207) shows a significant upward trend compared to Jan/Feb levels (~81), confirming the spring seasonality shift noted in carry-over insights. Notably, the Period 1 order (104 units) is still missing and appears to be a lost shipment, as the Period 2 order (112 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time 2). This loss has caused stockouts. Demand is accelerating (207 in P4). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-period lead time from reconciled shipments. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~159/week), ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*demand covers the upcoming periods. Given the high volatility and stockout history, sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (104 units) confirmed lost (P2 order arrived but P1 did not). Demand continues to accelerate upwards from 162 to 207 (+27% increase this week), establishing a high-growth spring seasonal trend.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a women's lace vest top, which is experiencing strong spring seasonality. Historical demand has shown a significant upward trend (105, 163, 162, 207rd, 105). The dip to 105 in Period 5 reflects 'sold' units (which were limited by 0 on-hand inventory) but the actual 'demand' was still present. Looking at the 'conclude' messages, the Period 1 order (104 units) is confirmed lost, while the Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 478 units (orders from P3, P4, P5). Given the rapid growth and the high lost-sales risk (on-hand is 0), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent peak demand observed (approx 200/week). Using L=2 (promised) as the most recent arrival (P2) arrived on time. I'll use a recent_N of 3 to capture the high-demand regime since Feb 11th.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 5 demand of 105 was constrained by inventory; actual customer demand remains in the 160-200 range based on P2-P4 trends. No new lead time anomalies since the P1 loss.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a women's lace vest top, which is currently in a spring seasonal peak (late March). Historical demand in Periods 2, 3, 4, and 6 was 163, 162, 207, and 190, respectively. Period 5 demand (105) and sales were inventory-constrained. The average demand in the last 5 periods (excluding the constrained Period 5) is approximately 180 units per week. The promised lead time is 2, but we have observed a loss (P1) and a short lead time (P5: 1 period). Since we are currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) and have 540 units in transit (P3: 116, P4: 198, P6: 122, plus the new order), we need to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture the high spring demand volatility. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the average demand of ~165-180 (including the low constrained period) and use explicit for sigma_hat to account for high volatility (std dev is ~40). L is set to calculate to average the observed lead times (2 and 1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand spring seasonal phase for this women's lace vest top (Period 8, Apr 1st). Demand has consistently hovered between 160-210 units in recent periods (P2: 163, P3: 162, P4: 207, P6: 190, P7: 210), with actual sales suppressed by stockouts (on-hand is 0). The P1 order of 104 units is confirmed lost. The P5 order (60 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period. We currently have 540 units in transit (likely from orders in P3, P4, and P6). Given demand is consistently around 200 units and lead time fluctuates between 1 and 2 periods, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at a rate of 200 units/period (600 total). This keeps the OR engine aggressive enough to replenish stock and account for the pipeline inventory against a robust seasonal forecast.

Carry-over insight: Established demand floor of ~200 units/week during spring peak (Mar-Apr). Lead time variability noted: P2=2 periods, P5=1 period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's lace vest top, and we are currently in April, which is the peak spring season. Historical demand data from Period 4 onwards shows a clear regime shift to a range of 190-220 units per week. The demand in Period 8 was 220, confirming the 'Period 8' carry-over insight of an established floor around 200 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 478 units in-transit (this transit includes the P8 order of 60 and likely previous orders from P7/P9 if they occurred, following the P1 lost shipment scenario). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P5=1, P6=2, P2=2). To manage the spring peak, I am setting the lead time to the promised 'default' of 2. For demand, I'll use recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 4-8) to capture the high-regime mean of approximately 185 (impacted by stockouts) or effectively 200+ adjusted. Using recent_N=5 will result in a mu_hat reflecting the ~200 unit baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed spring peak demand floor of 190-220 units per week (Period 4-8). Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), we are in the peak of spring seasonality for women's lace vest tops. Demand has stabilized at a high levels, with uncapped demand samples (Periods 4, 8, 9) averaging 205 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0 due to persistent stockouts. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P6 arrived in 2, P5 arrived in 1). The 560 units currently in-transit represent orders that should arrive over the next 1-2 periods. To maintain service levels during this high-demand window, I am setting L to 'calculate' to account for lead time variability and using an explicit mu_hat based on the localized demand average of ~205 units. With L=2, the target pipeline (L+1 periods) is ~615 units. Since we have 560 in-transit, the OR engine will order approximately 55 units to reach the base stock level.

While 473 units are in-transit, 104 units from Period 1 were previously confirmed lost, and recent shipments (P8, P9) have arrived, but were immediately consumed by demand. The lead time varies between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure we capture the persistent demand of ~200 units/week during this 'Essential Tanktop' season and account for the pipeline, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus on the established peak regime (avg approx 200). With profit and holding cost equal ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level, but the 'cap' logic requires a steady mu_hat to ensure replenishment orders are large enough to break the cycle of stockouts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29) context: The item is a 'Women's Essential Lace Tanktop', currently in the peak spring/early summer season. Demand in Period 11 spiked significantly to 337 units, up from the previously established floor of ~200 units/week. This suggests we have entered a secondary high-demand phase (late spring surge). On-hand inventory is 0, with 610 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P10, and P11). Historically, P1 was lost, while lead times for other orders have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. The P3 and P4 orders (314 units total) are significantly overdue (7-8 periods), suggesting they are likely lost, which explains the persistent stockouts despite high pipeline numbers. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the new demand level (average of the last 4 periods \u2248 238) and setting L to 2 to ensure the base stock covers the demand for the current period and the expected delivery window.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected starting Period 11 (2019-04-22): demand increased from ~205 to 337 units (+64%), reflecting late spring/early summer peak. Potential loss of shipments from Period 3 and Period 4 confirmed as they have not arrived within 8 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are managing an 'Essential Tanktop Lace' (Vest top) during the peak spring/summer transition. We hit a new demand regime in Period 11 with demand surging to 337 units, followed by a constrained 197 in Period 12 (likely limited by stockouts in reality, though demand is recorded). The 'Carry-over Insights' confirm the loss of shipments from Period 1, 3, and 4, which means the 714 units 'In-transit' likely include these 'ghost' units. Specifically, P3 (116) and P4 (198) are effectively lost, totalling 314 units that will never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering because it thinks these units are coming, I will use an 'explicit' L value and mu_hat value to force a higher base stock. Demand is now averaging ~267 in the last two periods (337, 197), but given the seasonality and stockout patterns, 300+ is more realistic. I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to 950 (approx 3 periods * 315 units/week) to ensure the system places an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13) analysis: Demand for this 'Essential Tanktop Lace' is in a high-volatility summer phase. While Period 13 demand dropped to 67 units, this follows a surge to 337 in Period 11 and 197 in Period 12. Given the seasonal nature (Womens Casual Vest top) and significant inventory stockouts in prior periods, I treat Period 13 as an outlier or potential stockout-driven reporting artifact. I am setting a demand floor based on the late spring/summer surge (avg of P11-P13 = ~200). Lead time is volatile (1-2 periods), so I use 'calculate' to average observed performance. Orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 12 are presumed lost or severely delayed, as they have not arrived within the expanded L window. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current (1+L) cycle demand of approximately 600 units (3 periods * 200 avg) to ensure the base stock recovers from the pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in May: P11-P13 range 67-337 units. Sustaining a mean forecast of ~200 units/week for early summer transition. Shipments from P3, P4, P7, P10, and P12 now categorised as likely lost (100% loss rate for these periods).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019-05-20), the demand for the Essential Tanktop has sharply declined over the last two weeks (67 and 61 units) following the late spring peak (337 units). This indicates the seasonal peak has passed, transitioning into a lower-demand early summer regime. The current on-hand inventory is 113 units, and the in-transit volume is high at 709 units, although historical data shows a massive loss rate (shipments from P3, P4, P7, P10, and P12 are considered lost). However, P11 and P13 shipments arrived successfully with a lead time of 2 periods. To avoid significant overstocking during this downward trend, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent two-week average for a 3-period window (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period delivery window, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the high volatility seen during the transition from peak to trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Post-peak decline started Period 13; average demand dropped from ~220 to ~64 units (-70%). High in-transit loss rate persistent (approx 50% of orders never arrive).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019-05-27), the SKU 572797002 (Women's Lace Tanktop) is in a post-peak seasonal decline. Over the last three weeks, demand has settled significantly lower (average ~96 units) compared to the spring peak (~210 units). The current stock-out in Period 15 was due to a demand spike (162 units), but the broader trend (67, 61, 162) suggests a lower mean. A critical issue is the high order loss rate: orders from Periods 3, 4, 7, 10, and 12 are missing, while later orders (P11, P12) arrived on time. This confirms a roughly 50% loss rate. Currently, there are 709 units 'In-transit', but most of these (from P3, P4, P7, P10, P13) are effectively lost. The OR backend needs to place an order to cover the next 3 weeks (L+1) while disregarding the ghost units in the pipeline. With a profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0/1.0, the target service level is 50%. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual 1-2 period delivery speed and use an explicit mu_hat of 300 to account for (1+L) periods of demand (~100 units/week * 3 weeks), which bypasses the incorrect 'In-transit' accounting that would otherwise prevent an order.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are transitioning out of the spring peak seasonal window for the tank top SKU. Demand history shows two distinct regimes: a spring peak (P4-P12) where demand averaged ~200-220 units/week (with a brief spike to 337), and a subsequent volatile drop starting P13. The last four demand samples are 67, 61, 162, and 209. While the last two periods show a resurgence, the high 'In-transit' quantity of 709 units relative to current demand is extremely concerning. This 709 figure includes orders from P13 (236 units) and several previously flagged 'lost' shipments (P3, P4, P7, P10, etc.). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (709) from the base stock calculation, and current demand is roughly 150-200 units, any calculated base stock will likely be lower than 709, resulting in no new orders. This is the desired outcome given we are likely over-ordered and have high potential for holding costs if the late shipments arrive simultaneously. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the post-peak volatility and default lead time settings.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand volatility confirmed (May-June): Demand fluctuated between 61 and 209 units. Large pipeline inventory (709 units) includes several shipments categorised as likely lost, but technically still in-transit in the system view.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 709 units in-transit. However, historical analysis (Period 14-17 insights) confirms a massive logistics failure: shipments from P1, P3, P4, P7, P10, P12, P13, P14, P15, and P16 are likely lost as they have exceeded the typical 1-2 period lead time significantly. Specifically, the 236 units ordered in P13 (5 periods ago) and subsequent periods have not arrived. Effective pipeline inventory is essentially zero. Demand is currently in a high-volatility summer phase, with the last three periods showing 162, 209, and 180 units. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this average (~184 units/week) across the lead time (L+1=3). sigma_hat is set using recent_N to account for the high variance. Lead time (L) is kept at the default because even though shipments are being lost, when they do arrive, they arrive in 1-2 periods; the OR engine cannot 'fix' lost shipments by increasing lead time, so I must force orders by treating the pipeline as dead.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss persists: Orders from P13 (236 units), P14, P15, and P16 have failed to arrive as of P17 conclude, confirming a ~80% loss rate over the last 10 orders. Pipeline inventory of 709 is non-functional.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '572797002' (Women's Tanktop) is experiencing a systemic shipment loss crisis and high demand volatility. Analysis of the history shows that shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, and 16 have failed to arrive, despite lead times of 1-2 periods. Currently, 709 units are listed as 'In-transit', but effectively none of these have arrived in the last 4 periods, leaving on-hand inventory at zero. Demand in the most recent period (P18) was 157, and the average since the post-peak decline (P13 onwards) is roughly 139 units. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' (709) from its targeted base stock, it will not place any new orders as long as L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are at standard levels. To force the system to bypass this 'ghost' pipeline and place an order to capture current demand (139-157 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. I calculate a target base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~150 * 3 = 450) and then add the phantom pipeline amount (709) to it, totaling ~1159 units. This 'explicit' mu_hat ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a non-zero order to replenish local stock. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed 1-2 period turnaround when shipments actually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains critical: ~80% of orders placed since P11 have failed to arrive. Total 'In-transit' quantity of 709 is non-functional phantom inventory. Demand has stabilized into a late-spring range of 140-180 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019/6/24), the inventory situation for SKU 572797002 is critical. Demand has stabilized in a range of 140-230 units per week (Average of last 3 periods \u2248 189 units). However, there is a severe systemic failure in the supply chain with a massive number of lost shipments. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1159 units is almost entirely 'phantom inventory' (orders from P3, P4, P7, P10, P13-P16 have not arrived). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock calculating the final order, it believes we are overstocked and will not place new orders despite our 0 on-hand inventory. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline. We need enough stock to cover (L+1) periods, but with an 80% loss rate and 1159 units of non-functional pipeline, I am setting mu_hat at 1500 to overcome the pipeline deduction and the 450 unit order from P19. sigma_hat is set to 200 to account for the high demand volatility (67 to 337 range seen in May/June).

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss rate remains ~80%. Orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16 confirmed as lost. Current demand regime (Late June) is 150-230 units/week.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 is experiencing a critical systemic failure in logistics, with a confirmed shipment loss rate of approximately 80% since Period 11. Despite an 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units, the actual stock available to meet demand has been zero for several periods. The current period is July 1st, a peak summer period for tank tops, and demand has surged to 366 units in Period 20. Orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 (placed between May 6 and May 27) are effectively lost, rendering the pipeline inventory 'phantom'. To counter this, I am maintaining high order parameters to force the OR engine to bypass the capped policy and attempt to secure stock, despite the high phantom pipeline. mu_hat is set to cover the observed demand of ~300+ units across the lead time (L+1=3). I specify L as 'explicit' at 2 to represent the physical lead time, even though the delivery reliability is poor.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains critical as of July 1st; total 'In-transit' of 1500 units is primarily phantom inventory due to an ~80% loss rate since May. Demand has spiked to 366 units/week, reflecting a July summer peak.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the scenario is defined by a critical systemic delivery failure and a summer demand peak for the 'Essential Tanktop Lace'. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1500 units is composed of orders from Periods 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, and 20. None of these have arrived. The last successful delivery was in Period 14 (ordered in P12). This represents an approximate 80-90% loss rate over the last 10-12 orders. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine the order size. Since the 1500 units in-transit are likely lost ('phantom inventory'), the system will calculate a negative order unless L and mu_hat are adjusted to override this. Demand has been high, with July 1st showing 366 units (summer peak) followed by 174. I will use 'explicit' lead time (L=15) to artificially inflate the pipeline requirement and force the OR engine to place a replenishment order despite the phantom inventory. mu_hat is set to roughly 3 periods of July demand (approx 250 avg) to ensure the order covers the immediate peak.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic shipment failure: 100% loss rate for orders placed between Period 13 and Period 20 (approx 1500 units lost). July summer peak confirmed with demand spiking to 366 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-99.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 (mid-July). Period 22 conclude shows that the order from Period 20 (341 units) arrived successfully with a 2-period lead time. However, the order from Period 19 (450 units) is now 3 periods out and hasn't arrived; given the established history of ~80-100% loss rates for shipments since May, I am treating the Period 19 order as lost. This leaves us with an on-hand inventory of 220 and a 'functional' in-transit of 0. Demand has cooled from the early July peak (366 units) to 174 and 121 units respectively over the last two weeks. Based on the product type (lace vest top) and mid-July date, we are likely entering the post-peak summer phase where demand stabilizes at a lower level before late summer clearance. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent deceleration (average ~220 units) and keep lead time at the promised 2 periods, as the P20 arrival suggests the logistics chain is still operational even if highly unreliable. The OR backend will compute a base stock based on the high demand volatility and moderate profit/holding cost balance.

Carry-over insight: Partial logistics recovery: Period 20 order arrived (P22), but Period 19 order (450 units) is likely lost. Net effective in-transit for inventory planning is currently 0 despite system showing 1159 units (primarily phantom inventory from P13-P19).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019-07-22), the product ('ESSENTIAL TANKTOP LACE TVP') is in a post-summer-peak decline. Recent demand has dropped from the July 1st peak of 366 to 174, 121, and 132 units respectively. The average demand of the last 3 periods is approximately 142 units. Regarding logistics, the systemic loss rate remains extremely high: orders from P13 through P19 (approx. 1159 units) have not arrived and are considered phantom inventory. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 1159 units is non-functional. However, the P20 order arrived correctly in P22 (Lead Time = 2), suggesting a possible stabilization of the supply chain for new orders. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, and 1159 units vastly exceeds any reasonable target, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that overrides this phantom inventory. To ensure the backend places an order, I will set mu_hat to the sum of the desired base stock (based on 3 periods of lead time coverage at ~145/week) PLUS the phantom inventory. Target base stock = 435 (3 weeks * 145); Setting mu_hat = 1594 (435 + 1159) forces the OR engine to see a deficit and order meaningful units. I use 'explicit' sigma to match recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand decline confirmed starting Period 21: demand dropped from 366 to range of 120-175 units. Logistics remains unreliable with 1159 units of phantom inventory (P13-P19) still in-transit, though P20 arrived successfully.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019-07-29), the SKU is in a post-summer transition phase. Demand has stabilized from its July peak of 366 down to a recent 3-period average of ~185 units (174, 121, 132, 254). However, the critical issue remains logistics: the 'In-transit' quantity of 1506 units is largely phantom inventory from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P7, P10, P12-P19). Specifically, the order from P19 (450 units) is now 6 periods old and clearly lost. The recent arrival of the P20 order in P22 suggests that while the loss rate is high, new orders can arrive with a lead time of 2. Because the on-hand inventory is 0 and the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit (including phantom units) from the base stock, I must set 'L' to an explicit high value or use an explicit 'mu_hat' to force an order that bypasses the 1506 units of phantom stock. The target base stock should cover 3 weeks of demand (~185 * 3 = 555 units). By setting mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (e.g., 2100), I ensure the backend generates an order to replenish the currently stock-out situation despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Phanton inventory 'In-transit' has reached 1506 units as of Period 24; orders from P19 and earlier are confirmed lost. Only orders from P20 onwards show potential for arrival.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019-08-05), the SKU is entering the late summer period. Historical demand for this cotton lace vest top peaked in early July and has since cooled. Recent observed demand (Periods 21-25) has ranged between 99 and 254, with the most recent sample at 99 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 156 units. Logistics remain the primary challenge: the 'In-transit' of 2000 units contains roughly 1100-1200 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P13-P19 that never arrived). However, P20 arrived on time (2-period LT), providing some hope for P24 and P25. To ensure stock while accounting for the high loss rate, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the post-peak mean (~156/week), but I'm setting L explicitly to 4. Since the OR backend uses (1+L) for the base stock calculation, setting L=4 effectively targets 5 weeks of demand (approx 780 units), which helps bypass the 'phantom' pipeline and forces a replenishment order to cover the current stockout, even with the presence of late-July orders in the system's pipeline view.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer peak demand decline confirmed: Decaying from July peak (366) to August mean of ~150 units. Logistics stability check: P20 arrived successfully (LT=2), but orders from P13-P19 (approx 1100 units) remain confirmed lost, inflating 'In-transit' figures with phantom inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (August 12, 2019), the demand for this women's vest top is in a clear late-summer decline phase. After a July peak of 366 (Period 20), demand has dropped significantly, with the last two observed samples being 99 and 79. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this downward trend (average of 121, 132, 99, 79), which results in a mu_hat of ~323 for a 3-period window (L+1). Logistics remain highly unreliable: 'In-transit' shows 2000 units, but approx 1100 of these (P13-P19) are confirmed phantom inventory from lost shipments. Only orders from P24 and P25 (totaling 841 units) are realistically expected. Because on-hand is currently 0 and recent demand suggests a shift toward a lower base, I will keep L at default (2) but use a conservative sigma_hat to account for high demand volatility observed during regime shifts. The OR backend will see the massive In-transit number and likely not order; this is desired given the high volume of potentially arriving units from P24/P25 relative to the current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand decay sustained: Late summer (August) demand has dropped to <100 units/week from July peaks of >300. Phantom inventory persists: total In-transit includes ~1100 units from P13-P19 that are lost and should be ignored for net effective inventory calculation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. The product (women's tank top) has exited its summer peak and is in a significant demand decay phase, with the last observed demand at 53 units down from July peaks of >300. Demand is stabilizing in a late-summer lower range. On-hand inventory is currently high (441 units) following the arrival of the Period 25 order. Regarding logistics, the 'In-transit' figure of 1506 is heavily inflated by phantom inventory (approx 1012 units from orders P13-P19 are confirmed internal losses). Effective pipeline inventory is much lower. However, with demand now significantly lower (~50-80 units/week) and 441 units on hand, we have over 5 weeks of coverage. To avoid excessive holding costs in a declining market, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) to capture the lower demand regime accurately. This will prevent the OR backend from placing new orders until the current stock is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand decay confirmed: August demand (P25-P27) has dropped to an average of ~77 units/week, down from late spring/summer averages of >200. Systematic logistics failure remains observed but partially stabilized for recent orders (P25 arrived in 2 periods).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (2019-08-26), the SKU is in a clear late-summer demand decay phase. The demand for the last 4 periods (P25-P28) has averaged 72.5 units/week, a significant drop from the spring/summer peak. Inventory levels are currently high with 382 units on-hand, which covers over 5 weeks of current demand. Regarding logistics, while 1506 units are technically 'In-transit', analysis of history (P13-P19) confirms approximately 1100 of these are phantom units from lost shipments. However, recent orders like P25 (arrived P27) suggest a return to the promised 2-period lead time. Given the high on-hand balance relative to the current low demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent decay (approx 75 units/week) and use recent_N for sigma to capture the lower volatility, ensuring the OR backend sees that we are overstocked.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late-summer demand regime (August): average demand has stabilized at ~75 units/week (-65% from summer peak). Logistics reliability for recent orders is stabilized at the promised lead time (L=2).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019-09-02. This is the transition from late summer to early autumn. Historical demand for the last five periods (P25-P29) has been 99, 79, 53, 59, and 83, averaging approximately 75 units/week. This represents a significant sustained decline from the summer peak (300+ units). The logistics system has partially stabilized for recent shipments, with P25 arriving in 2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' balance of 1506 is inflated by approximately 1100 units of lost shipments from the P13-P19 period (phantom inventory). Current on-hand inventory is 299 units. With an expected demand of ~75/week and L=2, the target base stock (calculated as (L+1)*demand) would be approximately 225 units. Since on-hand (299) already exceeds this coverage and demand is decaying further as we move into September, no new orders are required. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (N=5) and L to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed September transition: demand remains stable in the late-summer trough of ~75 units/week. Logistics reliability for recent orders is maintained at L=2.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/9/9, entering the autumn transition for this women's vest top. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer trough, averaging approximately 75 units/week over the last 6 periods (avg=74.6). The 'In-transit' balance of 1506 units is primarily phantom inventory from systemic logistics failures between Periods 13 and 19; however, recent orders (Period 20, Period 25) have arrived with the promised lead time of L=2. Current on-hand inventory is 224 units, which covers approximately 3 weeks of demand at the current rate (224 / 75 = 2.98). Since L=2, the target base stock needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). With 224 on-hand and an expected demand of ~225 over 3 periods, no new order is required this period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this stable low-demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time as recent performance has reverted to the promised 2 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer/early-autumn trough, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging 68.8 units/week (53, 59, 83, 75, 74). This is a significant decrease from the summer peaks of >300. In terms of inventory, we have 150 units on-hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 1506 is still heavily inflated by phantom inventory (orders from P13-P19) that are long-lost. However, recent logistics for P20 and P25 showed a stable lead time of 2 periods. Given the on-hand inventory of 150 and a current demand rate of ~70, we have approximately 2 weeks of stock. Since the lead time is 2 weeks, we are at the reorder point. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx 70 units/week * 3 periods) to prevent over-ordering as we move further into the off-season. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the reduced volatility of this stable period.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed stable at ~70 units/week (Period 27-31). Logistics for recent orders (P20, P25) has stabilized at L=2, though 1159 units from P13-P19 remain confirmed lost and contribute to phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 572797002 (Women's Essential Tank Top) is in a stable late-September trough. Demand has been consistently low for the last 6 periods (avg ~71 units/week), following the summer peak which ended in July. Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 units, which covers more than one week of current demand. However, the system shows a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 1506 units. Based on historical carry-over insights, approximately 1159 units from orders placed between Periods 13 and 19 are confirmed as lost shipments ('phantom inventory'). The only recent orders that have arrived were Period 20 and Period 25 (both with L=2). Since no orders were placed between Period 26 and 32, the pipeline is effectively empty despite the system display. We maintain the demand model at the current regime (recent_N=6) to avoid over-ordering during this low-season stage. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent successful arrivals have aligned with the promised 2 periods, though we remain cautious of the high historical loss rate.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's vest top entering late September/early October, a seasonal period where demand has stabilized at a lower trough (avg ~75 units) compared to the summer peaks. Last week's demand was 99, slightly above the recent mean, but on-hand inventory is now 0. Pipeline inventory (1506 units) is heavily distorted by phantom inventory from periods 13-19 and 24 which are long past the promised 2-period lead time and are confirmed lost. Recent actual lead times (P20, P25) have been consistent at L=2. To prevent the OR engine from incorrectly suppressing orders due to the large phantom in-transit stock, I am using 'explicit' L and mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 240, representing a conservative forecast for the lead-time-plus-review-period (1+L=3 periods) based on the ~80 units/week late-season average. Sigma_hat is set to 35 to provide a buffer for recent volatility (demand range 70-99). Since on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is 0, this will trigger the necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand regime confirmed stable at ~80 units/week. Effective inventory is 0 as the 1506 units 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory from historical systemic logistics failures (Periods 13-19, 24).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7th, 2019. Demand has shifted from a stable September regime of ~75 units/week to a lower early October level (P34 demand was only 35). This aligns with the 'Jersey Fancy' tank top product description as we move into autumn. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The system displays 1506 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are primarily phantom units from orders placed in P13-P19 and P24 that never arrived. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0. Recent successful arrivals (P20, P25) have followed the promised lead time of L=2. To capture the current seasonal low while ensuring availability for any minor autumn demand spikes, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the most recent 4 weeks (P31-P34: avg ~70). I set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) using this lower recent mean to avoid over-ordering during a seasonal decline, and I use an explicit L=2 to match recent reliable delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: October transition confirmed: demand dropped to 35 units in P34, indicating a sharp seasonal decline for the vest top category as autumn progresses.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-October (2019-10-14). The product is a 'fitted vest top with lace trims' (summer/spring seasonal item). Demand has significantly decayed from summer peaks (>300) to a clear autumn trough. Recent demand (P34-P35) averaged ~50 units, compared to the September average of ~80. This drop aligns with seasonal expectations for a vest top in October. Regarding logistics, the 'In-transit' figure of 1506 is verified phantom inventory from historical systemic losses (P13-P19, P24); recent actual arrivals (P20, P25) arrived with L=2. However, with 0 on-hand and 0 functional in-transit units, we need to order to meet the current low-demand regime. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P33-P35) to capture the sharp autumn decline (avg ~66 units), and sigma_hat similarly to reflect lower volume volatility. L is set to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand trough confirmed: Oct demand (P34-P35) dropped to ~50 units/week, a ~35% decrease from September levels. Phantom inventory (1506 units) remains in system view but is confirmed lost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Essential Tanktop Lace' is in a clear seasonal trough as of late October (Period 37). Average demand over the last three weeks (P34-P36) is approximately 53 units/week, significantly lower than the September average of ~75. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' indicator shows 1506 units, but history (see Carry-over Insights) confirms these are 'phantom' units from systemic logistics failures between Periods 13 and 24. While recent orders (P20, P25) arrived with a lead time of 2, the high 'In-transit' value will prevent the OR engine from ordering unless parameters are adjusted. To force an order that covers the current demand regime despite the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset to overcome the 1506 phantom units. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~160. To clear the 1506 pipeline hurdle, mu_hat needs to be at least 1506 + 160 = 1666. I will set mu_hat to 1700 to ensure a small safety stock is triggered. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to reflect the volatility of the current low-demand period (range 35-64).

Carry-over insight: October demand stabilized at ~53 units/week, marking the end-of-season trough for this SKU. Phantom inventory persists at 1506 units; all parameters must offset this value to trigger actual replenishment.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the demand for this SKU (Essential Tanktop) has entered a stable end-of-season trough, with recent weekly demand (P34-P37) averaging approximately 55 units. This is a significant decrease from the summer peak (>300) and the September transition (~75). Regarding logistics: system 'In-transit' shows 1700 units, but historical analysis confirms approximately 1506 of these units are 'phantom inventory' from systemic shipment failures between Periods 13-19 and Period 24. Only the order from P37 (194 units) is potentially viable. However, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) uses the system's total 'In-transit' figure. Because the phantom inventory far exceeds any reasonable base stock for current demand (base_stock \u2248 165 vs. 1700 in-transit), the system will not naturally place orders. To trigger necessary replenishment for the current demand regime, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a value that offsets the phantom inventory. I estimate current demand (L+1) at ~165 units (55 * 3), but I must add the ~1506 phantom units to the target to ensure 'base_stock - pipeline' allows for an order. I am setting mu_hat = 1750 and L=2 to ensure the OR logic generates a small maintenance order while accounting for the non-functional pipeline.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand trough confirmed for late October: weekly demand has stabilized at ~55 units/week. Systemic phantom inventory (orders from P13-P19, P24) totaling ~1506 units remains in the 'In-transit' view, necessitating artificially high mu_hat parameters to trigger actual orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-04. The SKU is a lace-trimmed tank top, which is now in a deep end-of-season trough (Autumn/Winter). Demand in the last five periods (P34-P38) has averaged 54.6 units/week, a significant drop from the summer peaks. Logistics has stabilized recently: the order from P37 arrived in only 1 period. However, the system reports 1556 units 'In-transit', which is almost entirely comprised of 'phantom inventory' from systemic logistics failures between Period 13 and Period 24 (specifically P13-P19 and P24). To trigger any real replenishment from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that exceeds this phantom pipeline (1556 units) plus the required safety stock for the current demand regime. Since we already have 141 units on-hand and demand is only ~55/week, we have over 2 weeks of supply. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory and the low seasonal demand to prevent unnecessary ordering while ensuring the 'stock' level appears high enough to the OR engine to not trigger orders we don't need, but also high enough that if we did need stock, it would overcome the phantom filter. Given the high on-hand relative to trough demand, I will maintain parameters that do not trigger new orders.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late Autumn trough (Nov): demand steady at ~55 units/week. Recent lead time observed at 1 period (P37 order), but overall logistics remain unreliable. Phantom inventory persists at 1506 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-11-11, which is deep into the autumn/winter season for this SKU (a vest top). The demand has continued to decline, hitting a new low of 26 units in Period 39. This confirms the seasonal trough identified in previous periods. Regarding inventory, we have 115 units on-hand. The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 1559 units; however, historical analysis (Carry-over insights Period 12-38) confirms that approximately 1506 of these units (orders from P13-P19 and P24) are permanent 'phantom inventory' due to systemic logistics failures and will never arrive. The only active orders in the pipeline are from Period 38 (50 units) and Period 39 (3 units). Lead time has recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P37 arrived at L=1). To account for the 1506 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from the base stock calculation, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that offsets this loss. Specifically, I calculate the desired base stock for the current period (around 200 units to cover 3 periods of ~60 mean demand + safety stock) and add 1506 to it. This ensures the engine triggers orders despite the inflated pipeline. I will set mu_hat significantly higher than actual expected demand (3 * 56 + 1506) to force the order logic to ignore the phantom units, while keeping sigma_hat representative of recent volatility (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter seasonal trough reached: Period 39 demand of 26 units marks a significant seasonal low for this vest top category.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Essential Tanktop) has reached its seasonal trough in November, with recent demand averaging approximately 43 units/week (P37-P40: 62, 53, 26, 50). The supply chain is still impacted by 1,506 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P13-P19 and P24) which remain 'In-transit' in the system view. Combined with current on-hand inventory (65 units) and the active P38-P40 pipeline (approx 54 units), the total system inventory (1560 in-transit + 65 on-hand = 1625) far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 43-unit demand regime. To bypass this and allow the OR engine to potentially place small maintenance orders if on-hand inventory actually depletes, mu_hat must be set high enough to offset the ~1500 phantom units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the current demand (avg ~45), plus the phantom inventory (1506). Since we are in a low-demand period, I will maintain a lean profile for actual arrivals while ensuring the system doesn't 'freeze' due to the phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter trough confirmed: demand is stable at ~45 units/week. Phantom inventory remains at 1506 units (lost P13-P19, P24), requiring mu_hat inflation to trigger any actual replenishment.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, which is the deep winter seasonal trough for women's vest tops. Demand has stabilized at a low level, averaging ~40 units/week over the last three periods (P39-P41). On-hand inventory is 28 units. The 'In-transit' total of 1582 units is almost entirely phantom inventory from historical losses (primarily P13-P19 and P24), with only very recent small orders (P40, P41) likely to arrive. To bypass the OR engine's logic that subtracts the massive (but non-existent) pipeline from the base stock, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the phantom quantity (~1582). I will set mu_hat to 1750 (approximately 1582 phantom units + 168 units for safety, covering 3-4 periods of demand at ~45 units/week). This ensures the backend triggers a small replenishment order. Sigma_hat is set to a standard level for this demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a late Autumn/Winter seasonal trough, but demand jumped to 125 units in Period 42 (likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales given the late November date). Despite this spike, historical evidence from October and November shows a typical mean demand between 40-50 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 1722 units is heavily inflated by 1506 units of confirmed 'phantom inventory' from systemic logistics failures (Periods 13-19 and 24). Only recent orders from P37 onwards are reaching the warehouse. To trigger replenishment despite this phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to exceed (phantom_inventory + expected_demand). I am setting mu_hat = 1722 (to offset phantom) + 150 (3 periods of average demand at 50 units) = 1872. Sigma_hat is set to account for the high volatility seen in the recent Black Friday spike. L=2 is used as recent orders (P37, P39) have arrived within 1-2 periods, suggesting relative logistics stability compared to earlier in the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed in late November: P42 demand spike to 125 units likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions, deviating from the Winter mean of ~45 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/9, post-peak for the Black Friday surge (P42 demand: 125, P43 demand: 31). The product is a seasonal 'Essential Tanktop Lace', currently in the winter trough. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 1846 units, but 1506 of these are from the Period 13-19 and Period 24 systemic logistics failures and are confirmed 'phantom' (lost). Only the orders from P42 (140 units) and P43 (150 units) are valid, totaling 290 real in-transit units. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend (which subtracts the full 1846 from its base stock calculation), mu_hat must be set as explicit: (Target demand for L+1 periods) + (Phantom inventory). I estimate the December demand mean at ~40 units. With L=2, (1+L) * 40 = 120 units. Adding the 1506 phantom units, the target mu_hat is 1626. This allows the system to recognize the 290 units as the actual pipeline against the 120-unit demand requirement. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P40, P41) arrived in 2-3 periods, aligning closer to the average.

Carry-over insight: December demand stabilized in the winter trough (~30-50 units) following the Black Friday spike. Recent arrivals (P40, P41) confirm that logistics have stabilized around the promised 2-3 period lead time, though historical phantom inventory (1506 units) remains in the system view.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019-12-16), we are in the deep winter seasonal trough for women's tank tops. Recent demand (excluding the Black Friday/Cyber Monday outlier in P42) has stabilized between 30-50 units/week. Logistics have stabilized significantly since the mid-year crisis, with recent orders arriving in 1-3 periods (P37 in 1, P39 in 2, P40 in 3, P41 in 2). However, a massive volume of 'phantom inventory' (1506 units from P13-P19 and P24) remains officially 'In-transit' in the system view. Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will not place any new orders as long as 1846 units are seen as 'in-transit'. To force replenishment and maintain service for the ~40 units/week demand, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to temporarily inflate the target stock level above the phantom inventory. I am targeting a base stock that covers the 1506 phantom units plus roughly 3 weeks of safety stock at current demand levels (approx 150 units), totaling ~1650 for mu_hat. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent actuals are close to this.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: stable at 30-50 units/week following Black Friday. Logistics for recent orders have stabilized at L=2 to L=3. Phantom inventory (1506 units from historical losses) remains the primary driver for parameter inflation.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/23. The SKU is in a winter demand trough (typical for vest tops) with demand stabilizing between 30-50 units/week after the Black Friday outlier. On-hand inventory is 248 units following the arrival of orders from P42 and P43. The system shows 1556 units 'In-transit', but 1506 of these are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P13-P19, P24) as per carry-over insights. Total effective inventory is therefore 248 units. Since the current demand regime is roughly 40 units/week and L=2, the required base stock is ~120 units. With 248 on hand, the SKU is currently overstocked for the winter season. No new orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime (N=5 for P41-P45) while using 'explicit' L to account for the recently observed 2-3 period lead time variability.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), the SKU is in a stable winter trough with demand ranging between 30-45 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 210 units, which covers approximately 4-5 weeks of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1556 units is heavily inflated by 1506 units of confirmed 'phantom inventory' from historical systemic logistics failures (Periods 13-19, 24). To calculate net effective inventory, the OR backend uses Base Stock - In-transit. Since the actual (functional) in-transit is 50 units (the order from P44 or similar, or 0 since P42/P43 arrived), and the system sees 1556, it will never place an order unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to exceed the phantom inventory. Given the current surplus (210 on-hand), no new order is needed this period. I will maintain mu_hat at a level that reflects recent demand (~40 units/week) but keep it low enough to avoid triggering an order until the on-hand inventory is depleted. L is set to 2 based on recent stabilized arrivals (P41, P43).
