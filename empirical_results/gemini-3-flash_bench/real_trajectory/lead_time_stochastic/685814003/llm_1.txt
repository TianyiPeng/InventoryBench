In the retail calendar, mid-February follows the deep winter clearance, transitioning into spring collections. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical demand over the last 5 weeks: 75, 51, 57, 123, 84. Average: 78. Standard deviation is approximately 28. There was a notable spike at Jan 28 (123), possibly due to a promotion or seasonal peak. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2 periods. No orders placed yet (P1), so no arrivals expected until P3 decision phase. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. Total coverage is 0. e) Final Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 periods). Estimated demand per period is ~80 units. For 3 periods, that's 240 units. Adding a safety stock for variability (approx. 40 units), the target inventory is ~280 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are 0, I will order 280 units.",

  "rationale": "Product Analysis: The item is a 'Jersey Basic Hoodie'. In late March (Period 7), demand for basic hoodies often begins to transition from winter peaks toward spring baseline levels, though early spring weather keeps demand relevant. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile (49, 123, 48, 59, 70, 27). The average demand over the first 6 periods is ~63 units. The most recent demand (27) was unusually low. Lead Time Analysis: Lead times have been highly inconsistent. P2 arrived in 2 periods (P4), P1 is lost, P3 is missing (overdue by 2 periods), P4 is missing (overdue by 1 period), and P5 arrived in 1 period (P6). The promised lead time is 2, but we see a range of 1 to 'lost'. Inventory/Pipeline: On-hand is 53. In-transit is 480 (P1: 280, P3: 50, P4: 50, P6: 100). However, P1 (280) is confirmed lost. P3 and P4 are currently delayed. If we exclude the lost P1, the 'real' in-transit is 200. Order Logic: We need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to handle the 2-period lead time.

Demand analysis shows a significant recent spike in Period 39 (159 units), which deviates from the previous stabilization around ~60 units/week. Given the date (Nov 11), we are entering the peak late-autumn/winter season where demand for hoodies is expected to remain high and volatile.

The current reliable pipeline consists only of the P39 order (80 units). Total reliable inventory = On-hand (210) + Active In-transit (80) = 290 units. With Period 39 demand at 159, and aiming to cover approximately 2-3 periods of demand to account for lead time variability and the seasonal peak, I need a target inventory level of ~350-400.

Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (159 in P39, 190 in P40), confirming a high-demand regime likely driven by colder weather and pre-holiday shopping. Current on-hand inventory is very low (20 units). The total 'In-transit' of 1030 is heavily distorted by 850 units of confirmed/likely lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17, P24, P29, P34).

This drop is likely a temporary dip or stockout-recovery stabilization before the mid-December/Christmas peak.
