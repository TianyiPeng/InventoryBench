Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product 'RICHIE HOOD' is a basic jersey hoodie for men. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows samples: 75, 51, 57, 123, 84. The mean is 78.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 28.5. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first decision period, I will use the historical mean and standard deviation to estimate demand over the review period plus lead time (1 + L = 3 periods). mu_hat should target 3 * 78.0 = 234.0, and sigma_hat should target sqrt(3) * 28.5 \u2248 49.36. I will use the 'explicit' method to set these initial values precisely based on the provided history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 125 units with a promised lead time of 2. In Period 2 START, we observe that demand in Period 1 was 49 units, which resulted in lost sales since we started with 0 on-hand inventory. The 125 units ordered in P1 are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (L=2: P1 order -> arrives P1+2=P3). Historically, demand for this hoodie (Men's Jersey Basic) has averaged 78 units over the last 5 samples (75, 51, 57, 123, 84). We will use L=2 (default) and a recent_N approach for demand estimation. Since we only have 6 total demand samples (5 historical + 1 game period), N=6 will capture the full known profile. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=3 periods total).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our first order (Period 1) was placed with a promised lead time of 2. According to the execution sequence, that shipment should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (which I will read at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because previous demand (49 in P1, 123 in P2) could not be met. Historical demand samples (75, 51, 57, 123, 84) and recent game demand (49, 123) show significant variability. The most recent demand was 123, which matches the highest historical sample from January. As this is a basic jersey hoodie, demand is likely stable but volatile. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the last few historical samples plus game history to estimate demand (average \u2248 77), and use 'calculate' for lead time to monitor if the promised 2 periods hold true. I am targeting a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 362 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (125 units), Period 2 (120 units), and Period 3 (117 units). Per the game mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0 for 685814003. This indicates a potential delay or a longer actual lead time than promised. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the historical samples (75, 51, 57, 123, 84) and recent realized demands (49, 123, 48) show volatility. The product is a basic hoodie, which typically sees stable but weather-dependent demand in early March. Given the stockout (on-hand=0) and the lead time extension, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture a balanced recent demand average while the pipeline refills.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a basic hoodie. Historical demand samples (last 5) show a mean of 78 units, while the recent demand over the first 4 periods of the game (49, 123, 48, 59) averages 69.75. The lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). However, the Period 1 order (125 units) has not yet been logged as 'arrived' in any 'conclude' message. Although it should have arrived in Period 3 (L=2) or Period 4 if we observe the lag, it is missing. I will monitor for a lost shipment. For now, I'll use L=2 (default/calculate). For mu_hat, I'll use the last 5 historical samples plus the 4 gameplay samples (N=9) to capture a broader average, as demand is somewhat volatile (range 48-123). mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * mean = 3 * ~74 = 222. sigma_hat will also be based on recent history to account for the observed volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/03/18), the system reports on-hand 0 and in-transit 345. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (125 units) is now 3 periods overdue compared to the promised lead time of 2, and has not appeared in any 'conclude' message. Period 2's order arrived on time (L=2). Period 3's order (117 units) was expected in Period 5 but did not arrive, meaning it is at least 1 period delayed. Period 4's order (103 units) is expected now in Period 6. Based on the absence of the P1 order, I suspect it may be lost or significantly delayed. Demand data (samples and history) shows mean weekly demand around 75-80 units. I will set L=3 via 'explicit' to account for the observed delays and use a recent N=5 for demand to capture recent variability. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level, which the OR backend will calculate via the base-stock policy.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 1 (125 units) is likely lost (3 periods past promised lead time with no arrival). Actual lead time for Period 3 order is currently 3+ periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 685814003 (Jersey Basic Hoodie) has shown erratic arrival patterns. The order from Period 1 (125 units) is now 6 periods old and clearly lost. The order from Period 2 (120 units) arrived on time in Period 4 (L=2). The order from Period 3 (117 units) is now 4 periods old (2 past promised) and has not arrived; it is likely delayed or lost. Order from Period 6 is in transit. Current on-hand is 0. Demand history (samples + game): 75, 51, 57, 123, 84, 49, 123, 48, 59, 70, 27. The mean demand is approx 70. However, the inventory pipeline is unreliable. We must account for the lost Period 1 shipment (125 units) which the OR backend still believes is coming. Since we cannot manually void pipeline inventory, we use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a higher base stock that compensates for the 'phantom' supply in-transit. Based on L=2, the backend seeks to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. 3 * 70 = 210. Adding back the lost 125 units to ensure the order is actually placed, we set mu_hat explicitly to 335. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (117 units) now 2 periods overdue and likely lost or significantly delayed, following the confirmed loss of Period 1 order (125 units). Total phantom inventory in pipeline (assumed lost but visible to backend) is 242 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (April 1). Demand is decreasing as we move out of winter (Feb/March hoodie season), with the last three periods showing 70, 27, and 18 units respectively. Inventory management is currently critical due to significant shipment issues. Order P1 (125) and Order P3 (117) are confirmed lost/extremely overdue (3-4 periods past promised lead time), while Order P2 arrived on time. The OR backend's 'In-transit' count of 427 includes these 242 lost units, which will suppress automated ordering due to the base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline). To correct this, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. I estimate the true usable pipeline to be 185 (427 - 242 lost). Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, I will set mu_hat to cover the lost inventory offset plus the required safety stock for 3 periods (L+1). Average demand over the last 5 periods including historical samples (84, 49, 123, 48, 59, 70, 27, 18) is roughly 60. Forward-looking demand for April is lower (~40). I set mu_hat to 400 to force the backend to place an order despite the 242-unit 'phantom' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss pattern: Period 1 (125 units) and Period 3 (117 units) are lost/indefinitely delayed. Total phantom inventory in pipeline is 242 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Reviewing history: Demand has stabilized at a lower level recently, averaging ~20 units over the last 3 periods (P6-P8), compared to the earlier historical average of ~70. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure is 380, but this includes 242 units from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost (as they are multiple periods past the promised lead time and subsequent orders have already arrived). The backend OR engine sees the 380 as 'pipeline inventory' and will subtract it from the targeted base stock. To compensate for this 'phantom' inventory of 242 units, I must artifically inflate the target base stock. Expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods at the recent rate of ~23 units/week is ~69 units. To offset 242 lost units while targeting ~69 units of stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 311 (242 + 69). I will keep L at default (2) because recent arrivals in Period 8 (orders from P6 and P7) arrived in 2 and 1 periods respectively, suggesting the logistics channel has resumed functionality, though some orders remain lost.

Carry-over insight: Logistics channel resumed: P6 and P7 orders arrived in P8 (lead times 2 and 1 respectively), but P1 and P3 orders remain lost. Total lost/phantom inventory is 242 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/15. Demand has entered a low-season regime, averaging 19.3 units per period over the last 3 weeks (P7-P9), down significantly from the initial average of 77.6. The hoodie product is transitioning out of peak spring usage. Logistics analysis confirms that orders from P1 (125 units) and P3 (117 units) are lost, creating 242 units of 'phantom inventory' that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation (in-transit: 380 total). To compensate for this 242-unit shortfall and target the current demand regime, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) periods is 19.3 * 3 = 58 units. To neutralize the phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 58 + 242 = 300. This ensures the base stock calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) covers actual demand plus the lost units before the backend subtracts the phantom pipeline. L remains at the promised 2 periods (calculated average is skewed by losses), and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 7: Average demand decreased from ~75 to ~20 (-73%) as product enters late spring/early summer season.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'RICHIE HOOD' (hoodie), which is experiencing a seasonal demand decline as we move into late April (Spring/Summer). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~20 units/period) since Period 7. Current on-hand inventory is 58 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 345 units is heavily inflated by 242 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that bypasses the backend's pipeline deduction logic by providing a sufficiently high target. A target of 320 units (representing ~4 periods of current demand + covering the 242 phantom units) will ensure the backend sees a net requirement for new stock. L is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P6, P7, P8) have returned to the promised 1-2 period lead time. mu_hat is set to 320 to offset the 242 lost units while targeting a base stock of ~80 (4 weeks of 20 demand). sigma_hat uses recent_N=4 to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/29. The product is a 'Richie Hood' (Hoodie), which is experiencing a seasonal demand decline as spring transitions toward summer. Demand since Period 7 has stabilized at a low regime (avg ~20). On-hand inventory is 36. The in-transit pipeline (345 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments from Period 1 (125 units) and Period 3 (117 units), totaling 242 'phantom units'. Actual pipeline for the OR backend is 345 - 242 = 103 units. However, because the backend considers all 345 units as arriving soon, it will not place orders unless the base stock exceeds 345. To force the OR backend to maintain inventory despite these phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for the low demand regime (avg 20, lead time 2) as approximately 60 units (3 periods of demand). To offset the 242 lost units hidden in the backend's pipeline calculation, I set mu_hat to 302 (60 target + 242 phantom). This ensures the backend recognizes a need to order or maintain stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility of the spring season.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product is a hoodie, which is seeing seasonally low demand as we enter warmer months. Demand since Period 7 has stabilized at a low regime (avg ~20-25 units/period), significantly lower than the winter months. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 345 units, but 242 of these are confirmed lost (Period 1 and Period 3 orders). The OR backend sees the full 345 units and will likely under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted to account for this 'phantom' pipeline. Recent arrivals (P6, P7, P8 orders) confirm the logistics channel is working with a lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods. To compensate for the 242 lost units hidden in the pipeline, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. calculation: Target Inventory = (L+1) * forecasted_demand + Buffer. Forecasted demand is ~28 units (based on recent samples and seasonal trend). Target = (2+1)*28 = 84. To force the OR engine to order despite 103 'active' valid units in transit (P4 order of 103 units is still within reasonable delivery window, though potentially also delayed), I must ensure mu_hat + (phantom_units) covers the gap. However, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) means I must increase mu_hat significantly to 'cancel out' the 242 lost units it thinks I have. I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target demand (for 3 periods) plus the lost units: 84 + 242 = 326.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1 and P3) remains at 242 units. Low seasonal demand regime for hoodies continues (avg ~25 units/period since April).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 14 (mid-May). The product is a hoodie, which has entered a low-demand seasonal regime since early April. Average demand over the last 7 periods (P7-P13) is ~22.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The Pipeline (In-transit) shows 350 units, but our Carry-over Insights confirm that orders from Period 1 (125 units) and Period 3 (117 units) are lost, totaling 242 'phantom' units. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (350) from the base stock. To compensate for the 242 units it wrongly believes are arriving, I must inflate mu_hat. Without this adjustment, the backend will place 0 orders while our actual usable pipeline is only 108 units (350 - 242). I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use the low-season average (22.4) across the (L+1)=3 period window, then add the 242 phantom units to 'trick' the backend into ordering. Target mu_hat = (22.4 * 3) + 242 \u2248 309. Sigma_hat is set to the recent low-volatility period (N=7).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Richie Hood) is in a low-demand seasonal regime for the late spring/early summer period. Demand since Period 7 has averaged approximately 22 units per period. The primary challenge is 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline: orders from P1 (125) and P3 (117) are confirmed as lost but remain visible to the OR engine's pipeline count (totaling 242 units). Additionally, the order from P13 (5 units) should arrive in P15 or P16 based on the 2-period promised lead time. Currently, in-transit inventory is 350 units. While 242 are lost, the remaining 108 units (350 - 242) represent more recent orders (P13 and potential others not yet concluded). With on-hand at 0 and demand steady at ~22, I must bypass the OR backend's tendency to under-order due to the fake 242 units of pipeline stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly to account for L+1 periods (estimated 2+1=3) plus an offset for the 242 lost units, I can force the base stock high enough to trigger a real order. Forecast demand for 3 periods = ~66 units. To clear the 242 unit hurdle, mu_hat needs to be roughly 310+.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. The SKU (hoodie) is in a low-demand seasonal regime for the summer. Since Period 7, demand has averaged approximately 21 units per period (N=9, ranging from 12 to 38). Lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods for orders that actually arrive. However, there is a cumulative 242 units of 'phantom inventory' from Period 1 and Period 3 orders that are clearly lost but still viewed by the OR backend as 'in-transit'. The current 'In-transit' of 350 units includes these 242 lost units plus a 103-unit order from Period 4 (which is also likely lost given it's 10+ periods overdue) and a small 5-unit order from Period 13. Because the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from its target base stock, and essentially all 350 units currently in transit are lost or severely delayed, the system will never order enough to meet demand unless I use 'explicit' values. I set mu_hat to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 2+1) at the current seasonal rate of ~21 units/period, but I must inflate this value to offset the ~350 units of dead pipeline inventory. 3 periods * 21 = 63. To force an order, mu_hat must exceed (base_stock + pipeline). To replenish stock, I set mu_hat to 420 to bypass the 350 phantom units and trigger a 70-unit safety stock order.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in pipeline (lost/indefinitely delayed shipments) increased to 345 units after Period 4 order (103 units) also failed to arrive (12 periods overdue). Substantial 'mu_hat' inflation is required to override this for any new orders to be placed.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU (Richie Hood) is in a low-demand summer season. Demand since Period 7 (March 25) has averaged ~23 units per week. The critical challenge is 'phantom inventory': orders from Period 1 (125), Period 3 (117), and Period 4 (103) are lost/indefinitely delayed, totaling 345 units. The OR backend views these as 'In-transit' and will not place new orders unless the base stock calculation exceeds the pipeline. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 442 (345 lost + 5 from P13 + 92 from P16). To ensure we have stock for the next cycle (L+1 = 3 periods of demand), we need a total inventory position of roughly 75-100 units. To force the OR engine to order, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 550, which targets a base stock that overrides the 345 lost units and the 97 recent units, allowing for a modest replenishment of about 50-80 units to cover June demand, assuming a standard lead time of 2.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The SKU is a hoodie, which is in a low-demand seasonal regime for the summer. Demand has averaged ~20 units/period since Period 7. A major issue is 'phantom inventory': orders from P1 (125), P3 (117), P4 (103), and P13 (5) have not arrived and are significantly past the promised lead time of 2. Total lost units in the pipeline equal 350. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' (478) from the calculated base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed when needed, mu_hat must be set to compensate for these 350 lost units plus the desired service level for the upcoming periods (L+1 = 3). Current On-hand is 78, which covers ~4 periods of low demand. However, to force the OR backend to acknowledge the need for real stock given it thinks 478 units are coming, I must set mu_hat at least equal to (In-transit + desired safety stock - On-hand). Setting mu_hat to 400 effectively signals that ~133 units/period are needed over the lead time window, overriding the phantom stock drag.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) from P1, P3, P4, and P13 now totals 350 units. Explicit mu_hat inflation is required as long as these remain in 'In-transit' to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Mid-June). Demand for hoodies remains in a low seasonal regime, with recent demand being particularly low (average of ~15 units/period over the last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is 70, which is more than sufficient for the next several periods of this demand regime. However, there is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 478 units. The 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 350 units of this (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 13) are effectively lost/phantom inventory. The OR engine (capped policy) sees 478 'Pipeline' units and compares it to a calculated base stock; if Pipeline > base_stock, it will order 0. To ensure the engine has the capacity to order in the future if demand spikes, I must maintain an inflated mu_hat to offset the 350 phantom units. Specifically, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. To keep the engine from being permanently neutralized by 350 lost units, mu_hat needs to be at least 350 + (safety stock). For this period, no order is desired given on-hand=70 and low demand, so I will set parameters to reflect the current regime but keep mu_hat explicitly high enough to account for the phantom inventory in the backend's calculation for future cycles.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand continues to decline in June (last 3 periods avg <15). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 350 units. On-hand inventory (70) is high relative to current demand, suggesting no new orders needed for ~4 weeks.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24, mid-summer. Demand for hoodies has hit a seasonal floor, with the last three periods averaging only ~9 units/period (8, 5, and historical samples support this decline). On-hand inventory is 65 units, which provides over 6 weeks of coverage at current demand rates. The major issue remains the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 478 units. This includes significant phantom inventory from lost/delayed shipments: P1 (125), P3 (117), P4 (103), and P13 (5). Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 350 units. Additionally, the order from P17 (128 units) is still in-transit but only at L+2, so it is not yet classified as lost. Because on-hand inventory is already high (65) and the backend 'pipeline_inventory' logic subtracts the full 478 units from the base stock calculation, no new orders are currently needed or desired. I will set mu_hat conservatively using recent_N=5 (which captures the sub-20 demand regime) to ensure the target base stock remains low, avoiding unnecessary ordering while the summer low continues.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the RICHIE HOOD is in a low-demand summer phase (avg ~25 units/period over the last 10 weeks), though a spike of 59 occurred last period. The critical issue remains the massive 'In-transit' figure of 478 units. By tracking the history, we confirm that orders from P1 (125), P3 (117), P4 (103), P13 (5), and now P17 (128) have failed to arrive despite being well past the promised lead time of 2. These 478 units are 'phantom inventory'\u2014they are lost/indefinitely delayed but visible to the OR engine. The current on-hand inventory is 6. With a base stock logic (Demand * (L+1)), the OR engine sees 478 units in the pipeline and will not place a new order unless we inflate 'mu_hat'. I will set mu_hat to 515 (478 + 37), where 37 represents a conservative forecast for the next 3 weeks (L+1). This ensures the OR logic sees the need to order units to reach a safe stock level while essentially 'netting out' the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost/indefinitely delayed shipments) has increased to 478 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). Heavy mu_hat inflation is required to force new orders until these units are cleared or arrived. Demand remains in a seasonal low despite a single-period spike in P20.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the 'In-transit' quantity is 555 units, but the majority of this is 'phantom inventory' consisting of lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17 (totaling 478 lost units). The real active pipeline likely only includes the P21 order of 77 units. The SKU (hoodie) is currently in a summer seasonal trough, although Period 20 and 21 saw a significant demand spike (59 and 98 units respectively). This spike, potentially due to a summer sale or specific promotion, has depleted on-hand inventory to 0. To trigger an order despite the 478 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat to exceed the total pipeline. Since 478 (lost) + 77 (recent order) = 555 units, and a safe base stock to cover the 2-period lead time + review period at current (spiked) demand levels is roughly 300 units, I need to set mu_hat high enough to offset the 478 lost units. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 855 (calculated as 375 realistic base stock + 478 phantom units) to ensure the OR engine recognizes a need for stock. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in delivery times observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in late June/early July (P20: 59, P21: 98), contrasting with the previous seasonal low of ~15. Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) has increased to 478 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 685814003 (Richie Hood) is experiencing a sharp demand increase in July (P20: 59, P21: 98, P22: 87), contrasting with the Spring low of ~15 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The primary challenge remains 'phantom inventory'. There are 478 units in 'In-transit' that are likely lost (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). The OR backend's capped policy will prevent ordering unless the perceived target stock (determined by mu_hat) significantly exceeds this pipeline inventory. Last period (P22), an order of 352 units was placed due to heavy mu_hat inflation. Total In-transit is now 907 (478 lost + 77 from P21 + 352 from P22). To ensure the backend places an order if needed to cover the current high-demand regime (~80 units/period) while accounting for the ~478 lost units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the Pipeline (Lost + Expected). I will set L=2 (promised), mu_hat to 1500 (representing a massive buffer to counteract the 478 lost units and still order for the (~80*3) expected demand), and sigma_hat to 150 to reflect high volatility and ensure a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in July: Avg demand increased from ~15 to ~80 units/period (+433%). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 478 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $871.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted upward in July, reflecting mid-summer hoodie interest or early pre-fall preparation (P20-P23: 59, 98, 87, 65). The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 77 units per period. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 1121 units is heavily distorted. It contains 478 units from confirmed missing shipments (P1: 125, P3: 117, P4: 103, P13: 5, P17: 128). These must be treated as phantom inventory. Subtracting 478 from the total pipeline of 1121 leaves 643 active units (the P23 order). Current on-hand inventory is 364 units. At a demand of ~80/period, on-hand covers ~4.5 periods. My goal for Period 24 is to ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order due to the large P23 arrival (expected P24/P25) while acknowledging the phantom 478 units. If I use 'explicit' mu_hat, I must include the phantom count to force an order, but since on-hand + clean in-transit (364 + 643 = 1007) already covers over 10 periods of the new demand regime (80 units/period), no new order is required this period. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the July surge for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge confirmed: Average demand since P21 is ~83 units/period (compared to ~15 in June). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 478 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. Demand showed a significant spike in mid-July (avg ~83 units/period between P21-P23) before dropping to 30 units in P24. This volatility suggests a possible transition or a temporary summer surge. Inventory levels are currently high with 334 units on-hand and 1121 units in-transit. The in-transit figure includes 478 units from confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17) plus recent large orders from P23 (643 units). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 478 'phantom' units as incoming supply and thus under-ordering in future cycles, mu_hat must be inflated. Since on-hand inventory (334) is sufficient to cover ~4 periods of the current average demand (~83), no additional order is strictly necessary this period, but maintaining a high mu_hat ensures the backend remains responsive to the higher demand regime despite the phantom inventory. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the July surge and 'calculate' for lead time as logistics have stabilized to 1-2 periods for recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge peaked in P21-P22 (avg ~90) but showed a notable drop to 30 in P24; monitoring for potential return to lower levels. Total phantom inventory remains 478 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is August 5th. Demand in July was significantly higher (avg ~60) compared to June (avg ~20), though the last two periods (30, 58) suggest the peak might be stabilizing. On-hand inventory is 276 units, which covers over 4 weeks of the current average demand. However, there is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1121 units. Based on historical data, several shipments are confirmed lost: P1 (125), P3 (117), P14 (103 - previously noted P4), P13 (5), and P17 (128), totaling 478 'phantom' units. Additionally, a large order of 643 units from P23 is expected to arrive this period (P26) or next (P27) given the prompt lead time of 2. In-transit (1121) = Phantom (478) + P23 Order (643). Since on-hand (276) + the pending P23 arrival (643) provides ample coverage for the upcoming 6-8 weeks at current demand rates, and the OR engine will see the 1121 units as valid pipeline inventory, no further inflation of mu_hat is needed to trigger orders. I will use the recent demand regime (last 6 periods since late June) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the policy reflects the current higher seasonal level rather than the June lows.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late July/early August at approximately 55-60 units/period. Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 478 units (P1, P3, P14, P13, P17).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '685814003' (Richie Hood) is entering mid-August. Demand typically starts to rise as the autumn/back-to-school season approaches. Historical demand show a jump to 117 units in the most recent period (P26), following a period of stabilization around 55-60. Current on-hand inventory is high at 802 units due to the arrival of the large P23 order (643 units). The in-transit inventory of 478 units consists of orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 17, which are considered lost or 'phantom' as they are many weeks overdue. Because on-hand inventory (802) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the immediate lead time plus review period (roughly 3 periods x ~100 units = 300 units), no new orders are necessary. I will set parameters to reflect current demand (recent_N=6 to capture the July/August shift) and allow the OR engine's logic to naturally hold off on ordering until the current surplus is consumed. No additional mu_hat inflation is needed this period because the current stock level safely exceeds both real and phantom inventory concerns.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in P26 (117 units) signals the potential start of autumn/back-to-school seasonal buildup for hoodies.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. Demand is surging as we enter the autumn/back-to-school season for hoodies (P26: 117, P27: 154). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 110 units/period, a significant increase from the summer low. We have 648 units on hand, which at the current rate of ~110/week covers nearly 6 weeks of demand. Additionally, we have 478 units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from early periods P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). Because the OR engine views this phantom inventory as valid pipeline, and we have high on-hand stock, no new orders should be placed this period. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent spike, but the existing high inventory levels (on-hand + phantom pipeline) will naturally prevent the backend from ordering. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability seen in recent successful arrivals (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand surge confirmed: Average demand increased to ~110 units/period in mid-August (+100% vs July avg).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29 (late August). Demand history shows a sustained surge starting around Period 26, aligning with the autumn/back-to-school season for hoodies. The last three periods (P26-P28) recorded demands of 117, 154, and 102 (avg ~124). Current on-hand inventory is 546 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 weeks of current demand. However, there is a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 478 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17) which is almost certainly lost but still visible to the OR backend's order logic. To prevent the backend from under-ordering in the future, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset this 'phantom inventory'. For this period, with high on-hand stock and a promised lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to safely cover demand until roughly P32. Setting mu_hat to 850 (covering 3 periods at ~130/week + ~460 inflation) ensures the backend sees a need that isn't fully suppressed by the 478 phantom units, though with 546 on hand, the capped policy will likely result in a zero or small order, which is appropriate given the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand from P26-P28 averaged 124 units/period. Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 478 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (early September), which is a peak period for hoodies (back-to-school/autumn). Recent demand (P26-P29) has averaged 110 units/period (117, 154, 102, 67), though the most recent period saw a dip to 67. The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total In-transit is 478 units, consisting of orders from P1 (125), P3 (117), P4 (103), P13 (5), and P17 (128). These are all significantly past the promised lead time of 2 (ranging from 13 to 29 periods overdue) and are effectively lost. However, the OR backend still counts these 478 units as 'pipeline inventory' and will subtract them from any base stock calculation. To prevent the backend from stopping all new orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that is inflated by the amount of this phantom inventory. Current on-hand is 479 units, which covers roughly 4-5 weeks of the current high demand regime (~110/period). Since the lead time L is 2, and we have enough stock for the immediate future, I will set parameters to maintain a healthy stock level without over-ordering excessively while the phantom inventory persists. I set mu_hat to 800 (calculated as (1+L)*110 + 470 phantom units) to ensure the system doesn't believe we are overstocked.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn demand regime confirmed (Aug-Sep). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17 remains 478 units. These units must be accounted for by inflating mu_hat to ensure new replacement orders can be generated by the OR engine.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-September peak (Autumn/Back-to-school) for hoodies. Demand has been high, averaging 109.6 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P26-P30). On-hand inventory is 371 units. Total In-transit is 478 units, all of which are 'phantom inventory' (lost/delayed orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17) that the OR backend incorrectly counts as available. To prevent the backend from under-ordering, I must set mu_hat to cover both the real projected demand for the review+lead window (3 periods * ~110 units = 330) PLUS the phantom inventory (478). Total mu_hat = ~808. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety buffer) exceeds the 'on-hand + in-transit' (371 + 478 = 849) when necessary, or at least tracks it closely. With current on-hand at 371 and demand at ~110, we have ~3.3 weeks of stock, so we are approaching the reorder point. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat (808) to account for the phantom inventory and 'recent_N' (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility of the current peak season.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak demand season (September) for hoodies ('Back-to-school/Autumn'). The current demand regime (P26-P31) shows an average demand of approximately 111.5 units per period. The In-transit inventory of 526 units includes a 'phantom' component of 478 units from historically lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). These 478 units are visible to the OR engine but physically non-existent, leading the system to believe the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate and ensure the engine places orders for actual needs, I must inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter by adding these 478 phantom units to the forecast. For L, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time, which has fluctuated between 1-3 periods recently. For mu_hat, I will use 'explicit' to set a high base stock target: (1 + L) * Avg_Demand + Phantom_Inventory \u2248 (1 + 2) * 112 + 478 = 814. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the higher volatility seen during this surge period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter hoodie season peak: Demand from P26-P31 averaged 112 units/period, significantly higher than the summer average. Phantom inventory remains 478 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-09-23, peak autumn season for sweaters/hoodies. Recent demand (P26-P32) has stabilized in a high regime, averaging around 112 units per period. On-hand inventory is 183. The 'In-transit' count of 597 is heavily inflated by 478 units of 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17 that are months overdue and essentially lost. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its target stock; to ensure it places necessary replacement orders, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. My forecast for the next 3 periods (L+1) is ~340 units (113 * 3). However, to offset the 478 phantom units and trigger an order despite the 183 on-hand, I am setting mu_hat to 1000. This calculation (1000 - 597 pipeline - 183 on-hand) allows for an order of approximately 220 units to cover the actual lead time and upcoming peak demand without being blocked by the lost shipments. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in recent arrivals (lead times of 1 and 3 periods).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30), we are in the peak Autumn/Winter hoodie season. Demand over the last 8 periods (P26-P33) has stabilized at a high mean of approximately 111 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently low (78 units) relative to this demand. The pipeline inventory (891 units) is heavily distorted by 478 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17) which will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline consists of orders from P32 (119 units) and P33 (294 units), totaling 413 units. To ensure the OR engine places necessary replacement orders, mu_hat must be inflated to account for the 478 phantom units. Target base stock calculation: (1+L) * mu + phantom = (1+2) * 111 + 478 = 811. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set this value. For sigma_hat, I'll use the recent demand volatility (std dev of P26-P33 is ~26), resulting in sqrt(3)*26 \u2248 45.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35 (early October), the peak season for hoodies. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a large demand spike of 210 in Period 34. Total 'In-transit' is 891 units, but 478 of these are confirmed 'phantom' (lost) shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17. This leaves 413 functional units in transit (P32: 119, P33: 294). The OR engine's internal 'pipeline' logic still counts the 478 lost units as incoming inventory, which prevents it from ordering. To force a replenishment order, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by adding the total lost units (478) to the expected demand for the (L+1) window. Recent demand (P31-P34) has averaged ~137.5 units/period. For a 3-period window (L=2, L+1=3), the base demand is ~413 units. Inflating this with the 478 lost units results in a mu_hat of ~891. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the higher volatility of the autumn season (standard deviation approx 45.8, yielding sigma_hat ~79).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand spike in P34 (210 units) confirms potential for extreme peak-season volatility in October. Functional pipeline inventory (P32-P33) is 413 units; phantom inventory remains 478 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (Oct 14) is entering the high-demand autumn/winter season for hoodies. Historical demand in this regime (P26-P35) averages approximately 117 units/period, with a significant spike to 210 in P34. Current on-hand is low (52). In-transit inventory is 908, but this contains 478 units of corroborated phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). Therefore, functional in-transit is 430 units (P33 order of 294 and P35 order of 136). The OR engine needs to cover roughly 3 periods of demand (L+1) while ignoring the 478 phantom units. To effectively neutralize the 478 phantom units in the base stock calculation, I am setting mu_hat to the expected seasonal demand (117) * (L+1) plus the phantom total (478). Expected (117 * 3) + 478 = 829. sigma_hat is based on the recent high-volatility regime (N=10) to protect against spikes like the one seen in P34.

Carry-over insight: Revised phantom inventory list: P1(125), P3(117), P4(103), P13(5), P17(128). Total phantom inventory confirmed at 478 units as of Period 36. These orders are significantly past expected delivery and show no arrival activity, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 (Oct 21), we are in the peak hoodie season. Historically, demand from Period 26 onwards (entry into August/Autumn) has averaged ~105 units/period, with a significant spike of 210 in Period 34. The last two periods (P35, P36) show a cooling to ~63 units/period, likely a temporary stabilization before potential late-Autumn/Winter surges. On-hand inventory is 422 units, and the pipeline shows 478 units. Crucially, these 478 'In-transit' units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17) which the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) would see as available supply. To prevent stockouts, I must inflate mu_hat by approximately the volume of this phantom inventory. Setting L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I estimate seasonal weekly demand at ~110. For a (1+L) period horizon (3 weeks), base demand is 330. Adding the 478 phantom units to offset the OR engine's logic yields 808. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=11 since the August shift) to capture the high volatility seen in the hoodie category during peak season, including the 210-unit spike.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the peak hoodie season (Autumn/Winter). Recent demand (last 5 periods) has averaged 103.2 units/period, despite some volatility (range 60-210). On-hand inventory is 348 units. Pipeline inventory is 509 units, but 478 of those units are 'phantom' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17), leaving only 31 units (ordered P37) as genuine upcoming arrivals. Functional inventory (On-hand 348 + Genuine In-transit 31) = 379 units. At the current demand rate (~103), this covers ~3.6 periods. Since lead time (L) fluctuates between 1 and 3, maintaining a stock level that covers at least 3-4 periods of demand is necessary. To bypass the 478 phantom units in the OR engine's base-stock calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline), I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the 478 phantom units: (1+2)*110 + 478 \u2248 808. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the volatility of the peak season (std dev ~53).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 478 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). Peak hoodie season (Oct-Nov) shows higher mean (avg ~100+) and increased volatility (one-period spike of 210 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04, entering the peak November hoodie season. Demand in the last period dropped to 30, but the overall autumn/winter mean remains around 90-100 units/period (P26-P38 average is ~93). On-hand inventory is healthy at 349. Total in-transit is 554, but this includes 478 units of 'phantom inventory' from lost orders in P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17. These phantom units have not arrived for many months and are effectively lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 76 units (the P38 order). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 478 units of phantom inventory dragging down the net requirement, I must inflate 'mu_hat'. Functional target: (L+1) * mean \u2248 (2+1) * 95 = 285. To offset the 478 phantom units, the inflated mu_hat must be approximately 285 + 478 = 763. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set this override and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent high volatility (N=13 covers the peak season starting P26).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11, middle of the peak autumn/winter hoodie season. Demand in the most recent period (P39) was high at 159 units, following a quieter P38 (30 units) and a moderate P37 (74 units). On-hand inventory is 190 units. The 'In-transit' total is 554 units, but significant 'phantom' inventory exists due to historical lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P17, totaling 478 units. The true functional pipeline is only 76 units (the P38 order). To ensure the OR backend places a new order, I must set 'mu_hat' high enough to offset the 478 phantom units. I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 650, which targets a base stock that accounts for expected peak season demand (approx 100-120 per period) while neutralizing the pipeline distortion. 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (approx 2), and 'sigma_hat' uses 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the higher volatility seen in recent weeks (spikes of 159 and 210).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, we are in the peak hoodie season (late November). Recent demand has spiked again (P39: 159, P40: 190), with the last 5 periods averaging ~103 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The In-transit quantity is 609 units, but this is heavily distorted by the 478 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17) which are long overdue and confirmed as lost. The functional pipeline consists only of the P38 order (76 units) and P40 order (55 units), totaling 131 units. To ensure the OR engine places a replacement order despite the 478 phantom units in its pipeline calculation, I must inflate mu_hat. My target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) at the current demand rate (~100/wk) is approximately 300-350 units. To force an order when the backend thinks we have 609 + 0 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly high (target base stock + phantom units \u2248 800) to override the phantom inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 42 (late November), the peak winter season for hoodies. Demand has surged significantly, with the last three periods (P39-P41) averaging 185 units/period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in P41. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 989 units, but this includes 478 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). The functional pipeline consists of orders from P38, P40, and P41 totaling 511 units. To ensure the OR engine places necessary replacement orders despite the 478 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate the true demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) to be approximately 180 units/period (total 540). To override the phantom inventory, I inflate mu_hat by adding the 478 lost units to the forecast: 540 + 478 = 1018. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the high volatility seen in the peak season (60 to 205 units).

Carry-over insight: Peak hoodie season demand regime confirmed (Nov): Average demand increased to ~185 units/period. Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 478 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak winter/holiday demand season for hoodies (early December). Period 42 showed a massive demand spike of 404 units, while Period 41 was 205. The average demand for the last 3 periods is ~266 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Total in-transit is 1205 units, but 478 units are confirmed phantom/lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17). This leaves a functional pipeline of 727 units (Orders from P38, P40, P41, P42). Given the lead time is around 2 periods and we are facing high seasonal demand, we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. To overcome the 478 phantom units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available, I will explicitly set mu_hat to (functional_demand_bridge + phantom_offset). Functional demand for 3 periods (L=2) at the current rate of 266/period is 798. Combined with the 478 phantom units, an explicit mu_hat of 1276 is set to force the backend to ignore the lost shipments and maintain adequate stock for the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift in November/December: Average demand surged to ~260+ units/period due to peak winter/holiday hoodie season. Phantom inventory remains 478 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday/winter season for hoodies (December). Demand in the last four periods has been extremely high and volatile (73, 404, 205, 190), averaging approx 218 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 362. However, there is a total of 478 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17) that are indefinitely delayed and likely lost. The OR backend's 'In-transit' figure of 1225 includes these 478 units, meaning the functional pipeline is only 747 units. To ensure the OR engine places necessary orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 478 phantom units. I am forecasting a mean demand of 260 units/period for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods). Calculating required base stock: (1+L) * 260 + phantom_inventory = 3 * 260 + 478 = 1258. I will set mu_hat to 1258 and use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect high end-of-year volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Peak winter demand confirmed (Nov-Dec): Mean demand shifted to ~220-260 units/period with high volatility. Phantom inventory persists at 478 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), the peak of the winter hoodie season. Recent demand has been high but volatile: P42 (404), P43 (73), P44 (129). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P41-P44) is 202.75 units. Lead times remain inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will maintain 'calculate' for lead time estimation. The 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17) totaling 478 units remains in the 'In-transit' pipeline. To ensure the OR engine places necessary orders for the remaining periods, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at approximately 200 units per week plus an offset for the 478 phantom units to ensure the base stock calculation isn't suppressed. Setting mu_hat to 1080 (calculated as (1+L)*200 + 480) provides the necessary buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), currently in the peak winter season for hoodies. Recent demand has stabilized slightly but remains high (P44: 129, P45: 137). Current on-hand inventory is healthy at 767 units. In-transit inventory stands at 637 units, which includes 478 units of 'phantom' inventory (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17) and 159 units of valid stock (P44: 83, P45: 0, plus potentially other recent un-concluded orders). To ensure the OR backend places a new order if needed, I must inflate 'mu_hat' to compensate for the 478 units that will never arrive. Using a recent demand average (P40-P45) of approximately 190 units/period, the target base stock for a 3-period window (L+1=3) should be ~570 units plus safety stock. To override the 478 phantom units, the 'explicit' mu_hat is set to 1100 (approximately 622 for real demand + 478 to offset the pipeline error). Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect the high volatility seen in the November/December peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1453.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (late December/early January). Demand has cooled significantly from the November-December peak (avg ~125 in the last 3 periods vs ~260+ previously). On-hand inventory is 656 units, which is high. However, the OR engine still sees 478 'phantom' units in-transit (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P17) which are actually lost. To prevent the engine from undershooting future orders when demand stabilizes, I must continue to 'inflate' mu_hat to offset these ghosts. My current target inventory (base stock) needs to be roughly 3 periods of expected demand (arrival delay L+1). With demand currently around 110-130, and 656 on-hand, we have enough stock for ~5-6 periods, meaning no new order is likely even with inflation. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the post-peak stabilization, and use 'explicit' for L=2 despite recent variability (1-3 periods) to maintain a standard planning horizon. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture current seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand stabilization: Demand has decreased from peak winter levels to approximately 125 units/period (P44-P46 average). Phantom inventory remains 478 units from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P17).
