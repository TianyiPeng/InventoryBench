Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers (Divided Collection). Demand for the first 5 weeks shows a rising trend (557, 438, 489, 500, 649). The latest observation (Feb 4th) is significantly higher, likely indicating the start of the Spring season ramp-up. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no history of actual arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for L to match the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, the historical mean is 526.6 and std is 78.8. Given the increasing demand and upcoming Spring peak, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this recent momentum and ensure the OR backend sets a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand. This balances the risk of stockouts during a seasonal upswing against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a seasonal apparel item (superstretch skinny denim). Looking at the historical demand (557, 438, 489, 500, 649) and Period 1's actual demand (544), the mean demand is approximately 529.5 units per period. In Period 1, we ordered 659 units (cap-limited) which are currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 2. This means they should arrive in Period 3 (visible in P4). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand for P1 was 544, we already have lost sales. To protect the service level for this high-volume item, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples (including P1 demand) to capture the current volume accurately. L remains default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our product is Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers. Historical demand data provided (557, 438, 489, 500, 649) shows an average demand of approximately 527 units/week. Since the simulation started, observed demand has been 544 (P1) and 545 (P2), which aligns well with the mean and shows stability. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered 659 units in P1 and 649 units in P2. Following the logic that an order placed in Period N with L=2 arrives during Period N+2 and is visible at the start of Period N+3, we expect the P1 order to arrive during the current Period 3 and become visible in the next 'conclude' message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have stocked out in P1 and P2 (sold 0 units against demand). Since demand is stable (~545), I will use recent history (N=5 including the 5 historical points and the 2 new points) to set parameters. L is set to default (2). mu_hat for L+1 (3 periods) is forecast at 1635 (3 * 545).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is a clothing item. Period 1-3 history shows demand has been consistent (544, 545, 451) with an average of 513. However, on-hand inventory has remained at 0 because the promised lead time (L=2) means the first order (placed Period 1) only arrives during Period 3's resolution and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message at the start of Period 4. Since the history provided only goes up to Period 3 conclude, the first arrival is imminent. Current in-transit quantity is 1729 (659 + 649 + 421). Demand for late February and early March is stable based on the available data. I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to allow the OR backend to adjust as the first shipments arrive and clarify actual lead time behavior.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple denim item. Looking at the history, the demand across these 5 weeks (including the seed data) has been: 557, 438, 489, 500, 649 (seed), followed by 544, 545, 451, 435 (observed). The average demand of these 9 samples is ~512. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). However, the Period 1 order (659 units) is notably missing: if it had a 2-period lead time, it should have arrived in Period 3; if 3 periods, in Period 4. Its absence suggests either a longer lead time or a lost shipment. Total pipeline inventory is 1080 (Period 1 shipment 659 + Period 3 shipment 421). Since Period 1's shipment is significantly overdue, I will treat the lead time as potentially 3 periods to ensure the base stock calculation covers an extra period of uncertainty. The demand mean is relatively stable around 512, but recent weeks show a slight downward trend (451, 435). I will use the mean of the last 4 observed periods (493.75) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N to capture the observed variance.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. Reviewing history: P1 order (659 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed, promised 2). P2 order arrived in P4 (lead time = 2). P3 order (421 units) should have arrived in P5 (lead time 2), but 'arrived=0' was reported for P5; this suggests P3 is either delayed or lost. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 1671 units in-transit (P1, P3, P5 orders). Demand is stable: mean of samples (557, 438, 489, 500, 649, 544, 545, 451, 435, 464) = 507.2. Recent demand (last 5 periods) mean = 487.8. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect slightly lower recent activity while maintaining a safety buffer. Given the missing P1 and P3 arrivals, I will explicitly set L=3 to account for the observed delays/uncertainty in the supply chain, which will increase the base stock calculation to cover the longer horizon. This helps ensure that when shipments do arrive, they are sufficient to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability detected: P1 order (Period 1) missing after 5 periods; P3 order (Period 3) missing after 3 periods. Actual lead time appears to be at least 3+ due to inconsistent arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' has been relatively stable around ~485 units (last 3 periods: 435, 464, 461), which is slightly lower than the initial pre-game samples (avg ~526). Lead time is highly volatile: Promised is 2, but P1 and P3 orders (total 1080 units) are missing/overdue, while P2 arrived in 2 periods and P5 arrived in only 1 period. This suggests severe supply chain inconsistency. On-hand is low (130) and 1450 units are in-transit (659 from P1, 421 from P3, 370 from P6). To protect against the high probability of stockouts caused by the missing P1/P3 shipments, I am increasing L to 3 (a conservative estimate reflecting the overdue status) and using recent_N=3 for demand to capture the current lower mean. Setting L higher in the OR backend helps build a larger safety stock to bridge the gap created by 'lost' or delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: P1 and P3 orders are overdue (>3-5 periods). Lead times are non-deterministic, ranging from 1 to >5 periods. Maintain higher L parameter to compensate for potential losses.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unstable. Reviewing the 'conclude' messages: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2); Period 5 order arrived in Period 6 (L=1). However, Period 1 (ordered P1, 7 periods ago) and Period 3 (ordered P3, 5 periods ago) orders have not arrived and are likely lost. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 1711 units in-transit (P1, P3, P6, P7). Demand is stable, averaging ~500 units per week (min 435, max 545). Because of the frequent 'lost' or significantly delayed shipments (P1 and P3), I will set L explicitly to 3 to increase the base stock level and force the OR engine to account for a longer lead-time buffer. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the demand mean and variance since Period 4, which reflects the current steady demand state of ~475-480 per week.

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss confirmed: Orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (total 1080 units) have failed to arrive after 5-7 periods, suggesting they are lost in transit. Pipeline inventory is currently inflated by these phantom units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Reviewing history, shipments from Period 1 (659 units) and Period 3 (421 units) are now 8 and 6 periods overdue respectively, confirming they are likely lost. The backend currently perceives an in-transit pipeline of 1349 units, which includes these 1080 'phantom' units. If we do not adjust, the OR engine will order nothing, despite having 0 on-hand inventory. The demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~530), but showed a spike to 795 last period, likely due to early spring seasonality for 'High-waisted jeans'. To fix the pipeline issue, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (1+L) demand PLUS the lost units, effectively 'tricking' the base stock formula into covering the inventory gap created by the losses. Promised L=2, so (1+L)=3. Expected demand for 3 periods (~1600) + recovery of lost units (~1080) = ~2680. Regarding L, while some orders arrived in 1-2 periods, the instability is high; I will use L=explicit 2 to keep the lead time component stable while forcing the volume through mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction required: 1080 units (from P1 and P3) confirmed lost at Period 8. Total in-transit currently contains 80% non-arriving units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/4/15). The current inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period, leading to significant stockouts. The demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~520), but supply has been highly erratic. Specifically, orders from Period 1 (659 units) and Period 3 (421 units), totaling 1080 units, are confirmed lost as they have exceeded both the promised (2) and maximum observed (2) lead times significantly. The OR backend's inventory calculation includes these 'phantom units' in the pipeline, preventing it from placing necessary orders. At Period 9, an order of 1145 was placed, but we are still missing the lost 1080 units from the system's logic. To compensate for the pipeline inflation and the high stockout risk, I am keeping L at an explicit value of 4 (higher than the promised 2) to increase the safety stock buffer. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the slight uptick in recent demand (avg ~550 since P6) and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 1080 units (P1, P3) are lost, but still counted as in-transit by the backend. Explicit L=4 used to force higher base stock to offset this phantom inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we confirmed that orders from Period 1 (659 units) and Period 3 (421 units) were lost (total 1080 units). However, the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic still includes these units, which causes it to under-order or stop ordering entirely because it 'thinks' 1080 units are coming. In Period 10, the arrival of orders from P8 and P9 provided much-needed stock (989 units on hand). Currently, the 'In-transit' figure of 1644 units is comprised of 1080 lost units and 564 units recently ordered in Period 10. To force the OR engine to place orders despite this 'phantom' stock, I will maintain an explicit L=4 and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to values that satisfy demand for that longer horizon. Historical mean demand since Period 1 is ~520 units/period. For a base-stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods, the required mu_hat is approximately 2600. setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction monitoring: 1080 units from P1 and P3 are officially lost and cause persistent under-ordering. Base-stock must be artificially inflated via L or explicit mu_hat until this phantom inventory is cleared or offset by higher safety stocks.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we have established that orders from Period 1 (659 units) and Period 3 (421 units) are permanently lost, totaling 1080 units. These 'phantom units' remain in the OR backend's 'In-transit' calculation, causing the capped base-stock policy to under-order significantly if we use standard parameters. The current in-transit (1810) consists of these 1080 lost units and the legitimate orders from Period 10 (564 units) and Period 11 (166 units), plus whatever was ordered in Period 12. Demand has stabilized recently after a spike in early April (Period 8: 795 units), with a 4-period average of ~478 units. To counteract the 1080-unit deficit in pipeline inventory, I am setting an explicit L=5. This increases the base-stock target (which covers 1+L periods) to effectively 'swallow' the phantom units while ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough inventory level to cover real demand. Historical lead times for delivered orders oscillate between 1 and 2 periods, so L=5 provides a sufficient safety buffer to ignore the lost 1080 units and still place orders for current needs.

Carry-over insight: Current real pipeline consists of P10 (564) and P11 (166). The 1080 units from P1 and P3 are officially confirmed lost and will likely permanently inflate the 'in-transit' statistic.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 is currently facing a significant issue with 'phantom inventory'. There are 1080 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost (as they have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 by over 10 periods), yet they remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 2650. The real pipeline includes P10 (564), P11 (166), and P12 (840), totaling 1570 units. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - In-transit' to calculate the order. Since 'In-transit' is inflated by 1080 units, it will consistently under-order unless we artificially inflate the base stock. Current demand is stabilizing around a mean of 450 units. To offset the 1080 lost units, I am using an explicit lead time (L) of 5. While the actual lead time is currently 1-2 periods based on recent arrivals (P8 and P9), setting L=5 creates a base stock requirement for 6 periods (L+1) of demand. At a mean of ~450, 6 periods equals 2700 units. Using L=5 should help the backend override the 1080-unit deficit in its calculations. Demand is slightly trending down, so I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-peak consumption levels.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory persistent: 1080 units (P1, P3) confirmed lost at Period 8 continue to inflate the backend 'In-transit' calculation, requiring an artificial inflation of L or mu_hat parameters to prevent systematic under-ordering.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In-transit inventory for SKU 706016002 is significantly inflated by 1,080 phantom units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost. The backend OR logic subtracts the total in-transit (2,484) from the base stock target, leading to severe under-ordering if not compensated. Current real pipeline consists of Period 10 (564 units, now overdue at L=4) and Period 12 (840 units, expected L=2). Since the backend uses 'In-transit' as an offset, I must artificially inflate the base stock target. To do this, I am setting L=5 (up from promised 2 and recently used 4) to increase the target inventory level to cover 6 periods of demand (L+1). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean following the April peak; I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current mean of ~360. This high L value acts as a buffer against the 1,080 phantom units being subtracted from our procurement calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 10 order (564 units) is now overdue (L=4 passed), increasing supply chain uncertainty. Maintain high artificial lead time (L=5) to offset the ongoing 1,080 units of phantom pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $968.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a significant inventory management challenge due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Historically, orders from Period 1 (659 units) and Period 3 (421 units), totaling 1080 units, never arrived and are confirmed lost. However, these units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (Total: 1644 units). The actual active pipeline consists only of the Period 10 order (564 units), which is now significantly overdue at 5 periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1644 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will refuse to order unless we artificially inflate the Target Inventory Level (Base Stock). Demand mean has slightly decreased over the last 5 periods (~366 vs. overall mean ~480). To counteract the 1080 phantom units, I am setting L=5 (explicit) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS a buffer to offset the 1080 units. Desired base stock \u2248 (6 periods * 400 demand) + 1080 loss offset \u2248 3480. Setting mu_hat to 3480 ensures the OR engine places a replenishing order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed P10 (564 units) is now overdue (5 periods). Combined with 1080 units lost from P1/P3, the total 'In-transit' figure 1644 is almost entirely composed of units that will not arrive soon or at all. Artificial inflation of mu_hat is necessary to bypass the OR engine's subtraction of this phantom inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical issue with 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 1 (659 units), Period 3 (421 units), and now Period 10 (564 units) are effectively lost, totaling 1,644 units. However, the OR backend sees these in the 'In-transit' total of 2,314 units and subtracts them from the base stock calculation, leading to systematic under-ordering. To ensure a stock arrival, we must bypass this subtraction. The current demand is approximately 400-470 units/period (average ~385 units over the last 5 periods). With a promised lead time of 2, we need a base stock covering 3 periods ((L+1)*demand). 3 periods * 385 = 1,155 units. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 2,314 'phantom units', we set mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom pipeline + desired base stock. Currently, (Phantom 1,644) + (Desired 1,155) = 2,799. We use an explicit mu_hat of 2,800. This forces the base stock calculation to remain high enough to trigger new replenishment orders despite the massive 'inflated' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed P10 (564 units) is lost. Total phantom inventory now 1,644 units (P1, P3, P10). The 'In-transit' statistic is severely compromised, nearing 71% non-arriving units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016002' (Skinny Denim) is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 2784 units is severely inflated by lost shipments: P1 (659), P3 (421), and P10 (564), totaling 1,644 'lost' units that will never arrive but are subtracted from the base stock calculation by the OR backend. The legitimate pipeline includes orders from P15 (670) and P16 (470). To allow the system to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom pipeline + safety stock requirements. Current demand is stable around 450-500 units. Using a promised lead time (L=2) for calculations, the required inventory for (L+1) periods (3 weeks) is ~1,400 units plus safety stock. To overcome the 1,644 phantom units, I am setting 'mu_hat' explicitly to 3,500. This should force the OR engine to place an order that restores on-hand inventory despite the perceived (but fake) high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost units (phantom pipeline): 1,644 (P1: 659, P3: 421, P10: 564). This represents approximately 59% of the 'In-transit' metric. Explicit mu_hat inflation is required until these units are cleared or offset.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the product (skinny denim trousers) shows steady demand with a recent average of approximately 450 units/period. The core challenge remains the 'In-transit' statistic, which is heavily inflated by 1,644 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, and P10 that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue). The current 'In-transit' of 2,517 units contains these 1,644 phantom units, meaning the real pipeline is only 873 units (from Period 17). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. Expected demand for lead time L=2 is roughly 450 * 3 = 1,350. Adding the 1,644 phantom units to this creates a target base stock of 2,994. I use mu_hat=2994 and sigma_hat=300 to ensure the backend places an order that respects the actual stock needs despite the corrupted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: No new sustained patterns. The 1,644 units (P1, P3, P10) remain lost and continue to inflate the In-transit statistic.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/06/17), we are managing a high-waisted denim trouser SKU with relative stable demand (mean ~460 units/period). However, the supply chain remains problematic due to 'phantom inventory'. We have confirmed 1,644 units as lost (P1: 659, P3: 421, P10: 564). The current 'In-transit' metric of 2,536 units includes these 1,644 lost units, meaning the 'true' pipeline is only 892 units (P17: 873, P18: 19). The OR backend policy [Order = Base Stock - In Transit] will systematically under-order by 1,644 units unless we artificially inflate the Base Stock. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to incorporate the lost units. Calculation: (Target Weekly Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. Using a demand forecast of 450 and L=2 (promised), target base stock without buffers would be 450 * 3 = 1,350. Adding the 1,644 lost units, the required mu_hat is 2,994. I will set mu_hat to 3,000 to ensure the backend places an order that ignores the phantom units and covers current demand levels. L is set to 'default' (2) to align the OR engine's lead time logic with promised values while my mu_hat adjustment handles the pipeline discrepancy.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016002' (High-waisted skinny denim) currently faces zero on-hand inventory and a demand level consistently between 350-500 units. The critical bottleneck is the 'In-transit' metric (2792 units), which is severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments totaling 1,644 units (P1, P3, and P10). These phantom units prevent the OR engine from placing necessary orders because it incorrectly believes the pipeline is full. The 'In-transit' figure also likely includes the P17 order (873 units) and the P19 order (275 units). To override the backend's subtraction of these 1,644 phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock by calculating demand for the review period plus lead time (L=2, total 3 periods) at an average demand of 450 units (total 1350) and then adding back the 1,644 units of phantom inventory to 'trick' the backend into ordering enough to cover actual demand. Total required base stock = 1350 + 1644 = 2994. I use recent_N for sigma to maintain a safety buffer based on current volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historically, demand for this denim product has stayed within a range of 300-500 units per week. The critical issue remains the significant phantom pipeline inventory. To date, 1,644 units (from P1, P3, and P10) are confirmed lost, as their expected arrival dates have passed by several weeks without a 'conclude' message. Currently, the system shows 3,056 units in-transit. Subtracting the 1,644 lost units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 1,412 units (P12: 840 - wait, P12 arrived P14, P15 (670), P16 (470), P17 (873), P18 (19), P19 (275), P20 (264). Actually, looking at the history: P15 and P16 arrived in P17; P18 arrived in P19. The 'real' pipeline consists of P17 (873), P19 (275), and P20 (264), totaling 1,412. The remaining 1,644 units (3,056 - 1,412) are definitively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 3,056 in-transit from the base stock calculation, it will severely under-order. To compensate, I am setting 'mu_hat' explicitly to include the current target inventory plus the 1,644 phantom units. I estimate weekly demand (mean) at 400. With L=2, the total lead-time demand window is 1,200 units (3 weeks). Adding the 1,644 phantom offset, I set mu_hat to 2,844 to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 22 (2019/7/8), and on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the product (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) has stabilized around 300-400 units in recent periods. The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' statistic, currently at 3056 units. Based on history, three major orders are confirmed lost: Period 1 (659), Period 3 (421), and Period 10 (564), totaling 1,644 phantom units. Furthermore, order P17 (873), P19 (275), and P20 (264) are currently within or slightly beyond the promised lead time window (L=2) but have not arrived yet. Since the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock to determine the order, the 1,644 lost units + any delays will cause severe under-ordering. To bypass this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock calculation, providing enough 'buffer' to counteract the 1,644 phantom units. I will set the target base stock to cover expected demand for L+1 (3 periods) plus the phantom volume. Lead time L is set to 3 to reflect recent arrival volatility, and sigma_hat is set to 250 to handle demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Persistent phantom inventory of 1,644 units (P1, P3, P10) continues to suppress automated ordering. Order P17 (873 units) is now overdue (L=5 passed), suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. Total likely phantom inventory exceeds 2,500 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised by lost shipments. Currently, the system shows 2,847 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 2,517 of these units are almost certainly lost: P1 (659), P3 (421), P10 (564), and P17 (873). The P17 order (873 units) is now 6 periods old, surpassing the expected lead time of 2. The only legitimate pipeline likely consists of P19 (275) and P22 (55). With on-hand inventory at 0 and nearly all in-transit units being 'phantom' inventory, the OR backend's built-in logic would normally stop ordering. To force an order, I must set 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat. Current demand averages around 310 units per week (last 4 weeks). To cover a target cycle of ~4 weeks (given lead time uncertainty), I set mu_hat to 1500 (approx. 5 weeks of demand) to bypass the 2,847 units being subtracted. Setting L to 5 provides additional safety cushion while the backend processes these errors.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Lost shipment tally updated to 2,517 units (P1, P3, P10, P17). P19 (275 units) is now 4 periods old and potentially delayed or lost. Systemic under-ordering due to phantom pipeline continues.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (July 22), the SKU '706016002' (denim trousers) faces a significant inventory crisis. On-hand inventory is 0, and the 'In-transit' metric (2792 units) is severely inflated by several confirmed or highly likely lost shipments. Based on history: P1 (659), P3 (421), P10 (564), and P17 (873) are substantially overdue, totaling 2,517 units of 'phantom inventory' that will not arrive. Adding P19 (275 units), which is now 5 periods old (exceeding the promised L=2 and suspected L=4), the likely total of non-arriving units is 2,792. This exactly matches the current 'In-transit' count, meaning there is zero real pipeline for this product. 

Because the backend OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock (calculated as mu_hat * (1+L)) to determine the order, these 2,792 phantom units will prevent any new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to bypass this value. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~328 units/week. To force an order that covers immediate demand and replenishes safety stock, I am using an explicit mu_hat that overrides the phantom 2,792 units plus 3 periods of future demand (approximately 1000 units), totaling 3,800. I set L to 'explicit' 2 to stabilize the base stock calculation, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' 5 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Real pipeline inventory is 0. Total 'In-transit' of 2,792 units consists entirely of lost or severely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19). Explicit mu_hat inflation is required to force ordering until these phantom units are cleared from the system statistic.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for item 706016002 is severely compromised. Historical data shows that orders from P1, P3, P10, P17, and P19 (totaling 2,792 units) are likely lost in transit, yet they still occupy the 'In-transit' metric used by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current 'In-transit' of 3,856 units, the OR engine perceives a massive pipeline surplus (3,856 units vs. a typical base stock of ~2,000) and will refuse to order, despite the fact that 72% of that pipeline is 'phantom' inventory. To force the system to order, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the total phantom pipeline plus expected demand. Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is ~287. To cover 3 periods (L+1) while overcoming 2,792 phantom units, I need a base stock > 3,653. I will set mu_hat (representing the base stock level target) to 5,500 to ensure the backend generates an order of approximately 1,600 units, replenishing the 0 on-hand inventory and accounting for the next several periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom inventory has reached 2,792 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19). In-transit is severely inflated, requiring explicit mu_hat > (Phantom Units + 3*Demand) to bypass the OR engine's subtraction of these non-existent units and maintain service levels.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical: the item is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and the 'In-transit' metric of 5,638 units is fundamentally broken. Historical analysis confirms that 2,792 units (from Periods 1, 3, 10, 17, 19) are lost and will never arrive, yet they remain in the pipeline calculation. Additionally, orders from P24 (1,064) and P25 (1,782) are still within or just past the promised lead time window. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this massive 'phantom' pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the safety stock required for the current regime. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages ~280 units per week. With a standard lead time of 2, the expected base stock should be ~1,100-1,200 units. However, because the backend subtracts 5,638 from its target, I must set the 'mu_hat' explicitly high. I am targeting an order of approximately 1,500 units to restore inventory while accounting for the ~2,792 confirmed lost units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to regain control from the distorted pipeline statistics.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total lost units in pipeline (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19) total 2,792 units. These units permanently inflate 'In-transit', requiring explicit mu_hat inflation of roughly ~4000-5000 units to trigger any new procurement from the OR backend.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state for SKU 706016002 is severely compromised by phantom in-transit units. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 6,837 units. Based on historical data, shipments from P1, P3, P10, P17, and P19 (totaling 2,792 units) are extensively overdue and confirmed lost. Furthermore, orders from P24 (1,064 units), P25 (1,782 units), and P26 (1,199 units) are still within or just past the expected lead time (promised L=2). However, given the zero on-hand inventory and the backend OR engine's logic of subtracting the entire 6,837 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, the system will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set higher than the phantom quantity plus desired safety stock. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~250 units (recent 5 periods). To force the engine to order and recover from the stockout, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 10,000. This value is designed to exceed the 6,837 'in-transit' units and the capped order logic, ensuring a replenishment order is triggered despite the inflated pipeline. L is kept at explicit 2 to prevent excessive cap-based throttling while maintaining a reasonable safety factor.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in-transit now totals 2,792 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19). Recent large orders from P24-P26 (4,045 units) are currently the only 'real' potential arrivals. The 'In-transit' metric is fundamentally unreliable, necessitating extreme mu_hat inflation to trigger ordering.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we finally saw the arrival of the P25 order (1,782 units) with a lead time of 2. However, several earlier orders (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26) totaling 4,265 units (Total In-transit 8,310 - P25 [arrived] - P27 [3,255] = 5,055, and adjusting for the fact that P24 and P26 are still technically within reasonable windows though P24 is overdue) are highly suspicious. Specifically, P1, P3, P10, P17, and P19 are definitively lost. Total confirmed phantom inventory is 2,792 units. On-hand is currently 1,367. The OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' (8,310) from the 'base_stock' to decide the order. To overcome this massive subtraction of phantom units and ensure we continue ordering for actual demand (approx 350-400 units/week), we must continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should be (Phantom Units + Pipeline for L=2). Given phantom units (~2,792) and desired safety stock/cycle stock for 3 periods (~1,200), a mu_hat of ~4,000-4,500 is needed to trigger the engine. I will set mu_hat to 4,500 to ensure the engine doesn't stop ordering due to the 8,310 'In-transit' figure while we wait for the P27 order (3,255) to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom inventory (units lost but still in-transit) updated. Confirmed lost: P1, P3, P10, P17, P19 (Total 2,792). P24 (1,064) and P26 (1,199) are potentially delayed or lost. Total reliable pipeline is only P27 (3,255).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from lost shipments, creating a massive 'phantom inventory' in the system. Confirmed or highly probable lost units include P1 (659), P3 (421), P10 (564), P17 (873), P19 (275), P24 (1064), and P26 (1199), totaling 5,055 units. These units are counted as 'In-transit' but will likely never arrive. The current backend In-transit is 8,310 units. Excluding the 5,055 phantom units, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 3,255 units (from P27). On-hand inventory is 1,019. Average weekly demand is ~350-400 units. To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite the 8,310 units of In-transit, I must set an explicit mu_hat that exceeds (In-transit + On-hand + Safety Stock). Calculation: 8,310 (In-transit) + 1,019 (On-hand) + 1,200 (approx. 3 weeks demand) = 10,529. I will set mu_hat to 11,000 to force a replenishment order and maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Phantom inventory (lost units still in-transit) significantly increased. Probable lost units now include P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, and P26 (Total: 5,055 units). Valid pipeline is likely only P27 (3,255).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), the item (Jade HW Skinny Denim) continues to face significant supply chain disruptions. The In-transit figure of 10,115 is severely inflated by 'phantom inventory' (lost or indefinitely delayed shipments). Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, and P26 (totaling 5,055 units) are highly likely lost given they are well past the observed lead times of 1-2 periods. The only 'real' potential arrivals are P27 (3,255 units) and P29 (1,805 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 10,115 from the calculated base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to counteract this phantom 5,055. Average demand recently is ~350 units. To maintain safety stock over the promised lead time (L=2) while bypassing the phantom deficit, mu_hat must be set to cover (Lost Units + Target Inventory). Calculation: 5,055 (lost) + (3 periods * 350 demand) + safety buffer \u2248 6,500. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 7000 to ensure the engine triggers procurement if real arrivals fail, while maintaining sigma_hat to account for high demand volatility observed (260 to 415 in recent weeks).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in pipeline (lost units) confirmed at 5,055 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26). The 'In-transit' metric is now ~50% non-arriving units, requiring sustained explicit mu_hat inflation (>6500) to trigger any backend ordering.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the large shipment from Period 27 (3,255 units) arrived after a lead time of 3 periods, significantly replenishing on-hand inventory to 3,446 units. This is the first major arrival in several periods. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 6,860 remains heavily inflated by phantom inventory. Based on the history, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, and P26, totaling 5,055 units. The only 'real' order remaining in transit is likely P29 (1,805 units). The current on-hand inventory (3,446) is high and covers approximately 8-10 periods of demand (averaging ~350-450). Therefore, no new ordering is required this period. To prevent the OR backend from ordering, I will set mu_hat to a value lower than the (On-hand + In-transit) sum while the large on-hand stock is depleted. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the most recent successful delivery.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: P27 (3,255 units) arrived after 3 periods. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline (phantom inventory) remains 5,055 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26). Current on-hand inventory is healthy (3,446), providing a buffer while the system monitors the arrival of P29 (1,805 units).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019-09-16), the primary challenge remains the systemic inflation of the 'In-transit' metric by 'phantom inventory'\u2014units lost or severely delayed that the OR backend still subtracts from its base stock calculation. Confirmed lost units (exceeding reasonable lead times) include those from P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, and P26, totaling 5,055 units. The arrival of P27 (3,255 units) in Period 30 has provided a healthy on-hand buffer of 2,906 units, covering approximately 5-6 weeks of demand at the current average rate (~500/week). However, because the backend sees 'In-transit: 6,860', any standard formula will result in zero orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed the phantom inventory plus the desired safety stock. Current demand shows a slight upward trend (P30: 526, P31: 540). To maintain service levels and trigger future replenishment as the on-hand buffer depletes, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 7,500. This value accounts for the ~5,055 phantom units plus a buffer for upcoming demand (~2,500 units for 5 periods). L=3 is used to reflect the most recent successful arrival (P27).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-651.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' statistic, which is heavily inflated by 5,055 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26). At Period 33, On-hand inventory is 2,455. The OR backend subtracts the full 6,860 units of 'In-transit' from its target base stock. To trigger any new ordering, the mu_hat parameter must be set high enough to cover current demand, the desired safety stock, and essentially 'cancel out' the 5,055 phantom units. Current demand is stable around 450-540 units. With an estimated real lead time of 2-3 periods, a target base stock should be around (3+1) * 500 = 2,000 units. To bypass the phantom in-transit subtraction, I set mu_hat to approximately 2,000 + 5,055 = 7,055. I will use 'explicit' values to ensure the OR engine maintains a healthy inventory buffer as the 1,805 units from P29 (ordered 4 periods ago) are still pending and increasingly likely to be delayed or lost.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Lost shipment tally remains 5,055 units. P29 (1,805 units) is now 4 periods old and past the promised lead time of 2, increasing the probability of further supply chain loss. Total reliable pipeline is approaching zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1450.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The critical issue remains the massive phantom pipeline inventory. There are 6,860 units recorded as In-transit, but based on history, a significant portion is lost: P1 (659), P3 (421), P10 (564), P17 (873), P19 (275), P24 (1,064), and P26 (1,199) total 5,055 units that are highly likely lost (overdue by 7-30+ periods). P29 (1,805) is also now overdue (4 periods vs promised 2), potentially raising lost units to 6,860. Currently, on-hand inventory is 1,674, which covers roughly 3 periods of demand at the recent average of ~540. However, the OR backend sees 'In-transit: 6,860' and will refuse to order anything unless base_stock exceeds (1,674 + 6,860) = 8,534. To combat this systematic under-ordering, I must set an explicit mu_hat that compensates for this phantom 6,860 units plus expected demand for the lead time. Expected demand (L+1) is ~1,620 (using recent mean ~540 and L=2). Therefore, I setting mu_hat explicitly to 8,500 to keep the system on the verge of ordering and ensure safety stock is maintained despite the corrupted in-transit metric.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Supply chain loss confirmed at 6,860 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). On-hand inventory is currently the only reliable stock. Systemic under-ordering will persist until these units are cleared or offset by extreme mu_hat inflation (>8500).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability. As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' metric of 7,080 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and likely P29). I estimate the persistent phantom inventory at 6,860 units. Current on-hand inventory is 1,202 units, which is roughly 2.5 periods of demand (avg ~480). To prevent the OR engine from subtracting these 6,860 phantom units and resulting in zero orders as on-hand stock depletes, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock to be (Desired Coverage + Phantom Inventory). Desired coverage = 3 periods * 500 units = 1500 units. Adding 6,860 units of phantom inventory yields a target of ~8,360. This will force a small corrective order to maintain a safety buffer while we wait to see if the P34 order (220 units) arrives.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments still in-transit) totals 6,860 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Ongoing explicit mu_hat inflation > 8,000 is required to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction and maintain local availability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The critical issue remains the significant volume of phantom inventory (lost shipments) in the 'In-transit' metric, which totals 6,860 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). These units inflate the pipeline, causing the OR backend to systematically under-order or stop ordering entirely because it believes enough stock is coming. On-hand inventory is currently 853 and demand remains steady around 400-500 units per week. To force a new order, mu_hat must be set high enough to exceed both (In-Transit + On-Hand) and the safety stock requirement. I am setting mu_hat to 9200 units (based on approx. 6860 phantom + 500 * (1+2) expected demand + safety buffer). This parameter choice is explicitly designed to bypass the 'pipeline inventory' subtraction in the OR engine and ensure procurement continues while the phantom units remain in the system.

Daily Reward (R_t): $417.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period is 37 (October 21, 2019). Detailed shipment tracking confirms that 6,860 units are lost (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). These units remain in the backend 'In-transit' metric (8,212 units), meaning only 1,352 units are actually moving (P34: 220, P36: 1132). On-hand inventory is 883. Average weekly demand is approximately 400. The OR backend calculates final_order = base_stock - In-transit. Because In-transit (8,212) is severely inflated by phantom units, it will prevent any new orders unless base_stock is artificially inflated to exceed the phantom tally plus the required buffer. To ensure the backend triggers an order of about 1,000-1,200 units (to cover 3 periods of demand), base_stock must be set above 9,500. Using an explicit mu_hat of 10,000 ensures the backend overrides the phantom units and places an order for the upcoming shift toward late-year demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed total phantom inventory (lost shipments still in-transit) is 6,860 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29). Only orders from P34 onwards are potentially valid. Explicit mu_hat >= 10,000 is required to bypass the corrupted In-transit metric.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 38 (late October). On-hand inventory is 542 units, and the backend reports 9,326 units in-transit. However, based on the historical logs and Carry-over Insights, a massive portion of this pipeline is composed of lost shipments. Confirmed lost: P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, and P29 (total 6,860 units). Recent orders P34 (220), P36 (1132), and P37 (1114) are still within plausible arrival windows, but P34 is now 4 periods old (promised L=2). The 'In-transit' figure is severely corrupted, leading the OR engine to believe we have sufficient coverage, while in reality, we are at risk of a stockout. The average weekly demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' is approximately 400-500 units. To force the OR engine to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' higher than the 'phantom' inventory plus a safety buffer for the lead time. Given phantom inventory (~6,860) and desired base stock for 3 periods (~1,500), I am setting 'mu_hat' explicitly to 10,000 to overcome the pipeline subtraction and ensure availability as we enter November.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: P34 (220 units) is now 4 periods old and likely lost, bringing the total estimated phantom inventory to 7,080 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Only P36 and P37 are considered 'real' incoming stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant challenge due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014units that are lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' figure by the backend OR engine. Total historical losses are estimated at 7,080 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Current In-transit is 8,558, meaning approx. 83% of the reported pipeline is unlikely to arrive. The backend formula (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed the phantom units. With 47 periods total, we are entering the final stretches including November. Demand has been stable around 300-500. To ensure the backend triggers an order to maintain stock for the remaining 8 periods, I will set an explicit mu_hat of 10,000. This value is calculated to offset the ~7,080 phantom units plus provide a coverage of ~3,000 units (approx. 6-7 weeks of demand at 450/week). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability in recent successful arrivals (P37 arrived in 1 period, P35 in 1, P27 in 3).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in-transit now estimated at 7,080 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). P34 (220 units) is 4 periods old and considered lost. Only P36 (1,132) and P38 (346) are currently treated as 'real' incoming stock. Explicit mu_hat inflation > 8,500 is necessary to bypass the corrupted in-transit metric.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), the primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total units recorded as In-transit is 7,704, but a significant portion of this is composed of lost shipments. Confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34) total 7,080 units. The 'real' pipeline likely only includes P38 (346) and P39 (278), totaling 624 units. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 2,227 units. However, to prevent the OR backend from seeing 7,704 units and stopping all future orders, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. Given the current date is mid-November, we are entering a high-demand retail season. I will set mu_hat at 9,500. This value is calculated to exceed the phantom inventory (~7,080) plus approximately 4-5 periods of demand (approx 500/period) to guarantee the backend triggers replenishment orders as on-hand stock depletes, despite the corrupted In-transit metric.

Carry-over insight: No new sustained patterns. Cumulative phantom inventory (lost shipments still in-transit) remains estimated at 7,080 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). This persistent data corruption requires manual mu_hat inflation to maintain product availability.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from severe data corruption. The 'In-transit' metric of 7,704 units is largely composed of phantom inventory (lost shipments), which I estimate at 7,080 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Only recent orders like P38 (346 units) and P39 (278 units) are potentially 'real' arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 1,919, which is healthy relative to recent weekly demand (approx. 300 units). However, the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from its base stock calculation. If I use default parameters, the engine will see 1,919 (on-hand) + 7,704 (in-transit) = 9,623 units, conclude we are overstocked, and never order. To maintain a safety buffer and prevent future stockouts once on-hand is depleted, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds this phantom floor. I set mu_hat to 8,500 to allow for approximately 1,400 units of 'real' target inventory (Target = mu_hat - phantom_in_transit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-817.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016002 is currently facing a significant data integrity issue in its 'In-transit' metric. As of Period 42, the In-transit figure is 7,426 units. However, based on historical lead-time analysis, orders from P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, and P34 (totaling 7,080 units) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. Only P38 (346 units) is a 'real' potential arrival. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' value (7,426) from the base stock to determine the order quantity. To prevent the system from being paralyzed by this phantom inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the expected demand for the lead time. Current demand is stable around 280-310 units. With an on-hand inventory of 1,921, we are safe for several periods, but we must maintain the 'mu_hat' inflation to ensure the backend can trigger an order if demand spikes or on-hand drops significantly. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 9,000 to offset the ~7,100 phantom units and provide a buffer for actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments still in-transit) updated to 7,080 units (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Current In-transit metric is >95% unreliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4909.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2nd, entering the peak holiday season. Demand in Period 42 spiked significantly to 1,366 units (up from an average of ~300 in the preceding month), consistent with Black Friday/Cyber Monday patterns. On-hand inventory has dropped to 555 units. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' metric. We have a confirmed tally of 7,080 units from historical orders (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34) that are significantly overdue and likely lost. The OR engine will subtract the total In-transit (7,426) from any base-stock calculation. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 10,500. This value is designed to exceed the phantom inventory (7,080) plus approximately 2.5 periods of forecasted high-holiday demand (~3,400 units). This forces the backend to place a substantial order. Lead time L is set to 3 to reflect recent actual observed delivery times.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 42 demand spike to 1,366 units (+350% vs recent avg) confirms seasonal holiday peak. Phantom inventory remains at 7,080 units, requiring sustained manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019, during the peak holiday season. Period 42 saw a massive demand spike (1,366 units), and demand is expected to remain high leading up to Christmas. The 'In-transit' figure of 10,759 units is severely corrupted by approximately 7,080 phantom units (lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). The real pipeline currently consists of P38 (346 units) and the large order from P43 (3,333 units). With only 249 units on-hand and high seasonal demand, we must ensure the OR backend places another significant order. Since the 'In-transit' metric is fundamentally broken, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 12,500. This value is calculated to exceed the ~7,100 phantom units plus the ~3,700 real units in the pipeline, ensuring the backend triggers a replenishment order to cover the next 2-3 weeks of high holiday demand (forecasted at 500-1000 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peak confirmed (P42: 1366 units). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 7,080 units, continuing to bypass standard automated ordering calculations due to In-transit inflation.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are entering the peak holiday season (mid-December). Period 42 showed a significant demand spike (1,366 units), and demand in Period 44 exceeded available stock. The 'In-transit' metric of 13,514 units is severely corrupted. Based on historical tracking, at least 7,080 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Additional units from P43 (3,333) and P44 (2,755) are potentially real, but they have not arrived yet. Because the OR backend subtracts the total In-transit from the base stock, I must set an explicit mu_hat that is higher than the sum of the phantom inventory and the expected peak demand to force an order and prevent a stockout during the final weeks. I will target a safety level that accounts for the phantom units (~7,000) plus high holiday demand (~1,500-2,000 per period).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are two periods away from the game's end. Current on-hand inventory is 3,068 units following the arrival of the Period 43 order (3,333 units). Demand has normalized after the late November spike (P42), with the last three periods averaging ~307 units. At this rate, the current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods (P46 and P47). The 'In-transit' figure of 10,181 is severely corrupted by roughly 7,080 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34), leaving a 'real' pipeline of ~3,101 units (primarily P44). Because on-hand stock is already high and the game concludes in Period 47, any new orders placed now (Lead Time >= 1) would arrive in Period 47 at the earliest and largely contribute to ending inventory (holding costs) rather than sales. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to a low value to prevent further ordering, effectively allowing the current stock to bleed down.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. We are exiting the high-demand holiday period (noted in Period 42 with 1,366 units). On-hand inventory is healthy at 2,837 units due to the arrival of 3,333 units from Period 43. However, the 'In-transit' metric (10,181 units) remains severely corrupted by a massive accumulation of phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34), totaling approximately 7,080 units. Additionally, the order from Period 44 (2,755 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, though it is not yet confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total In-transit figure from its base stock calculation, any standard automation will result in zero orders for the foreseeable future, even as on-hand stocks deplete. To prevent a stockout once current on-hand inventory is exhausted, I must maintain an explicit mu_hat that exceeds the sum of the phantom inventory and the desired safety stock. I am setting mu_hat to 8,500 to neutralize the ~7,080 phantom units and plan for ~1,400 units of actual demand coverage over the lead time and review period.
