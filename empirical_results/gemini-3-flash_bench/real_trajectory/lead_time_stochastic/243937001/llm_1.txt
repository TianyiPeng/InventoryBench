  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, I have no internal history of arrivals yet, so I must rely on the provided historical demand samples and world knowledge. The product is 'Fine-knit socks in a soft cotton blend' (5-pack). Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows values of 70, 77, 91, 79, and 73, averaging approximately 78 units per week. February 11th is the start of the current period. There is no immediate major holiday spike expected for standard socks in mid-February (Valentine's Day has minimal impact on bulk-pack socks compared to gift items). The promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts considering the observation delay and lead time, I need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (Periods 1, 2, and 3). Expected demand for 3 periods at 78 units/period is 234 units. Since on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, I will order enough to cover this pipeline plus a small safety margin for variance.",

Order P1 (250 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion (Period 4 start). Currently, arrived=0 for P1, P2, and P3. Since Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for the P1 order, the shipment is either delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. d) Current inventory: On-hand=0, In-transit=400 (250 from P1, 150 from P2). I have zero stock and have missed sales for 3 periods. e) Because lead time appears longer than promised or shipments are delayed, I must cover at least 3-4 periods of demand (approx 240-300 units). I have 400 units in the pipeline. If I order more now, I risk a massive inventory spike and high holding costs once the 'dam breaks' and arrivals catch up.

Demand in the historical data (Jan/early Feb) was higher (avg ~78) but has settled into a lower regime (avg ~37.5) over the last three weeks (Periods 3-5).

Demand peaked in Period 37 (130 units) and has since decelerated (101 units in P38, 71 units in P39). This suggests we have passed the initial seasonal surge. Lead times remain volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (e.g., P37 order arrived in 1 period, P36 order took 3 periods). The cumulative 'ghost' inventory (known lost orders) is 605 units (P1, P10, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34). Current In-transit is 955 units. Subtracting the 605 units of ghost inventory leaves a reliable pipeline of 350 units (P38 order of 200 units, P39 order of 150 units).

Historical demand for Period 42 (late November) saw a sudden spike to 127 units from a previous average of ~85-90, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday or early December holiday shopping. Current on-hand inventory is 42 units. The in-transit pipeline (805 units) is heavily distorted by 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1: 250, P10: 45, P14: 30, P17: 20, P19: 35, P24: 25, P26: 15, P29: 15, P34: 170), totaling 605 units of lost stock. This leaves a reliable pipeline of 200 units (all from P38, ordered 5 periods ago). However, since P38 has not arrived after 5 periods (well past the 2-period promise and recent 3-period max lead time), P38's 200 units is now also highly likely to be lost. This brings total likely ghost inventory to 805, meaning the actual reliable pipeline is 0. With demand at ~130 and zero incoming stock confirmed, a large order is required to cover the December holiday peak and replenish stock. Forecasted demand for the next 3 periods is ~390 units (3 x 130). Subtracting on-hand (42) and factoring in total pipeline failure, I will order 350 units to mitigate stockouts during the high-profit seasonal window.",

Historical demand for the same period last year (Jan/Feb start) was ~70-80 units, but this year's seasonal trend peaked at 130 and seems to have a secondary surge in late November/early December (~127 units in P42). Demand in P43 dropped to 65, but we were out of stock (only 42 units sold against a 65 demand), so the true demand signal might be slightly muted by stockouts, though actually it trended down momentarily. Given it's December, I expect demand to remain high (80-120 range) until the post-holiday drop in January. Regarding inventory: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 1155. However, my 'ghost' inventory assessment is critical. Orders from P1 (250), P10 (45), P14 (30), P17 (20), P19 (35), P24 (25), P26 (15), P29 (15), P34 (170), and P38 (200) are almost certainly lost based on the 2-period promised lead time and historical failure. Total lost = 805 units. Thus, reliable pipeline = 1155 - 805 = 350 units (all from the P43 order). With a lead time of 2 periods, the P43 order should arrive in P45. I have nothing arriving for P44. To cover demand for P44, P45, and P46 (L+1), I need approximately 300 units (3 * ~100). The 350 units arriving in P45 should cover this, but I need to ensure a buffer for the remaining periods (45, 46, 47) and potentially higher holiday demand.

The P43 order (350 units) was placed on Dec 2 and is now in its second period of lead time; it is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 45.
