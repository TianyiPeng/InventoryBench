This is a staple/basic item with consistent year-round demand, likely seeing slight upticks during spring as sneaker weather approaches. b) Demand Analysis: Historical data (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows demand between 28 and 41 units, with an average of approximately 34 units per week. The most recent week was 31. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts, I need to cover the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods) of demand. d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: With an average demand of ~34, I need at least 102 units (34 * 3) to cover the pipeline. I will order 120 units to provide a small safety buffer for the initial stock-up, considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which justifies a higher service level.",

In-transit is 120 (due P3/P4). e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (the L+1 window). Total expected demand for 3 periods (P2-P4) is ~105 units (3 * 35). My pipeline already contains 120 units. However, I am currently out of stock for Period 2 and will be for Period 3 as well. Ordering now will arrive in Period 4 (visible P5). Since the current pipeline (120) covers the demand for the window it arrives in, and I cannot fix the immediate P2/P3 stockouts due to lead time, I will place a conservative order of 35 to maintain the rolling pipeline for Period 5.",

Current demand (Nov) is steady at ~35-50 units per period, a significant drop from the summer peak of ~160. Following a period of aggressive ordering to compensate for a ~50% shipment loss rate, the pipeline is now heavily saturated (1610 units in-transit). Recently, orders from P36 and P37 arrived, suggesting that while lead times are variable (1-3 periods), the supplier is active. With current on-hand inventory at 179 and demand at ~40, I have approximately 4 periods of stock. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the massive volume in-transit (even if only 50% arrive, that is ~800 units), there is a significant risk of extreme overstocking if ordering continues. I will stop ordering to allow the current inventory and impending arrivals to be absorbed, minimizing holding costs while monitoring if the high in-transit volume actually materializes.",

Currently, there are 243 units on-hand and 1500 units in-transit. Even assuming a 50% shipment loss rate, the expected arrivals effectively cover demand for dozens of periods, far exceeding the remaining game duration (up to Period 47).

The game concludes at Period 47, meaning only 5 periods of demand remain.
