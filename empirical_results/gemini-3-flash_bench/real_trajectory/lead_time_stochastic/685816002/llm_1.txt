The product is a 'Round-necked T-shirt in soft cotton jersey' (Men's Underwear/Jersey Basic), which is a high-volume staple product. Looking at the historical demand provided from Jan 2019 to Feb 2019, the average demand is approximately 66 units per week (76, 64, 73, 53, 65). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable at the start of Period 4. I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (the current period plus the lead time duration) to avoid lost sales, though Period 1 demand will inevitably be lost since current inventory is zero. Total demand to cover for L+1 (3 periods) at an average of 66 units/week is roughly 198 units. Given the consistency of the data and high service level target (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will order slightly above the mean to establish a buffer.",

This suggests demand is currently fluctuating around 65-80 units, potentially stabilizing after an early seasonal peak or due to stockouts in P5. P5 demand was capped by supply (sold 18/65), masking true demand, but 65 is likely the baseline. (c) Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4).

Historical data showed a February peak (avg ~106) but recently (last 3 periods) demand has dipped to 82, 65, and 56 (avg ~68). This decline likely represents a stabilization back toward the January baseline (~66) rather than a continuous downward trend, given the seasonal context. Period 1's order (200) is confirmed lost. Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (LT=2). Period 3's order (100) and Period 4's order (100) are overdue (LT=2 would have seen them arrive in P5 and P6 respectively); however, Period 5's order (120) arrived early in Period 6 (LT=1). This suggests significant supply chain variability/instability. My current inventory assessment: On-hand=64, Pipeline=500 units (Orders from P3, P4, P6). Total stock + pipeline covers ~8 periods of demand at the current rate (~70/period). Ordering more now would create excessive holding cost risk if the 'missing' 200 units (P3/P4) suddenly arrive.

This indicates a sustained increase in demand as the weather warms. Inventory assessment: current on-hand is 210 units. Total system in-transit is 520, but history analysis reveals 400 units are lost (P1: 200, P3: 100, P4: 100).

Considering a target of (L+1) periods (3 periods) and a forecast of ~110 units/period (reflecting the recent high-demand regime and seasonal growth), we need ~330 units to cover demand through P13.

Historically, recent demand has dropped from ~100 units in September to a low of 33 units in Period 36, though the average over the last 4 observed weeks (P33-P36) is approximately 85 units. Supply chain reliability for this SKU is notably poor, with a confirmed history of lost shipments (1,390 units to date). System 'In-transit' shows 1,490, but subtracting confirmed/likely losses (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24 = 1,390 units), the true effective pipeline is only 100 units (the P36 order). On-hand inventory is 177 units. Order logic: To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), assuming an average autumn demand of ~70-80 units, we need approximately 210-240 units. Current inventory (177) + effective in-transit (100) = 277 units. This is sufficient to cover 3 periods of expected demand without significant stockout risk. However, given the high loss rate, a small buffer order is placed to maintain stock levels as we approach the end of the year.",
