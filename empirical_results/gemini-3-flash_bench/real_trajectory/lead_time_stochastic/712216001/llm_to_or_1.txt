Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. The product is a women's v-neck vest top (Everyday Collection), which typically shows stable demand but can be influenced by early spring seasonality as we enter February. Initial historical data across 5 periods (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean demand of 85.6 units/week with a downward trend (120 down to 73). On-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover the risk of stockout while establishing a baseline, I will use all 5 historical samples to calculate demand parameters. The base stock policy needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand, which in this case is 3 periods of demand (2+1). Since profit is equal to holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I'll use 'default' methods to leverage all available historical data points for the initial order.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory. The order of 120 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit and expected in Period 3 (given a promised lead time of 2). Demand in Period 1 was 91, which resulted in lost sales due to zero stock. We now enter Period 2 with 0 on-hand inventory and 120 units in-transit. Looking at the historical demand (120, 87, 80, 68, 73, and now 91), the mean is approximately 86.5 with a standard deviation of 17.5. Since this is a 'V-neck vest top' (Spring/Summer item) and we are in mid-February, demand is expected to remain steady or rise as we move toward warmer months. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to better reflect the recent demand trend (80, 68, 73, 91, and including the earlier 87) which averages roughly 80. Since L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I'll set L to default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a Women's Vest Top. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averages 85.6 units/week. Recent periods (P1: 91, P2: 106) show a slight upward trend as we approach the spring season. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P1 (120 units) and P2 (96 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the P1 order (placed at start of P1) is scheduled to arrive during the resolution phase of P3 (today) and will be visible in the P3 conclude message. Therefore, our current on-hand inventory is 0, but we expect 120 units to arrive after our current decision. To set parameters: 1) L is set to default (2). 2) Mu_hat: Using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent slight increase in demand (avg ~91) rather than the older Jan data (avg ~85). 3) Sigma_hat: Using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 2-period lead time plus the current review period.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'V-neck top in woven fabric with spaghetti shoulder straps' (Vest top), which is a spring/summer seasonal item. We are currently in early March (2019/3/4). Historical demand samples from January/February show a mean of 85.6 units/week (120, 87, 80, 68, 73), but the most recent performance in the game history (Periods 1-3) shows a higher realized demand of 91, 106, and 91 (avg: 96). With a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods, an order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 3's conclude message (read at Period 4 start). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', meaning the P1 order (120 units) is delayed. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales. I will maintain L=2 (default) for now but use recent history (N=3) for demand to capture the upward shift from the initial pre-season samples. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) targets the current demand regime of ~96/week.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's V-neck vest top, which typically sees increasing demand as spring progresses toward summer. Historical demand samples (before P1) averaged ~85.6 units/period. Actual demand in periods 1-4 has been: 91, 106, 91, 104 (average 98). This indicates a shift to a higher demand regime compared to the pre-game history, likely due to seasonality. Lead time for the Period 2 order was confirmed as 2 periods (arrived P4). However, the Period 1 order (120 units) is now 2 periods past its promised delivery (L=2) and has not arrived; I will treat this as a likely lost shipment, meaning 'In-transit' is effectively lower than the reported 192 (potentially 192 - 120 = 72). Our current on-hand is 0. With L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand level (~98/period) rather than the long-term average (~85/period). L remains at the promised 2 for now, as one order arrived on time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 1: average demand increased from ~85 to ~98 (+15%) likely due to spring seasonality. Period 1 order (120 units) is 2 periods overdue and potentially lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Collection V-neck vest top'. Historical demand from the provided sample and recent gameplay shows a stable yet increasing trend as we enter spring (average ~98 units/week). Status Check: On-hand is 0. The order from Period 1 (120 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery date (L=2) and has not arrived; I am treating this as a lost shipment. The order from Period 2 arrived on time (L=2) in Period 4. The order from Period 3 (35 units) was expected in Period 5 but is now 1 period overdue. Due to the high risk of lost or delayed shipments and zero on-hand inventory, I am setting L=2 (promised) but will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current spring regime (avg ~97 for the last 5 periods). The OR backend's capping mechanism will moderate the order size, but we must signal a higher base stock requirement to overcome the 'lost' units in the pipeline that the backend still counts as 'in-transit'.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed loss of Period 1 shipment (120 units) as it is 3 periods overdue. On-hand remains 0 due to stockouts and pipeline delays.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), we are entering the spring season for a 'V-neck top with spaghetti straps,' which typically sees rising demand. Historical data shows demand averaging ~98 units recently (P1-P5), though P6 dropped to 49. The Period 1 order (120 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost, reducing our effective pipeline. We have 53 on-hand and 192 in-transit (P3: 35, P4: 37, P5: 120 - P5 was already arrived/deducted). Specifically, the arrived 102 units in P6 (from P5 order) indicates lead times fluctuate (1 period for P5, 2 periods for P2). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this variability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand regime which is higher than the very early spring samples, while accounting for the recent dip as potential noise or inventory constraint impact. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Confirmed lead time variability (P2 took 2 periods, P5 took 1 period). Period 1 order (120 units) is officially categorized as lost and removed from procurement logic considerations.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the product is a V-neck top, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a shipment loss (Period 1 order) and lead time variability. Order P2 arrived in 2 periods, while P5 arrived in 1 period, leading to an average observed lead time of 1.5. I will use L=calculate to account for this. Demand analysis: Demand in the first 5 periods averaged ~97, but the last two periods averaged ~55. However, Period 7 sales were limited by on-hand inventory (sold 53, demand 62), and the drop in Period 6 demand (49) might be a weekly fluctuation or data noise rather than a regime shift down, given the product type's seasonal relevance in April. I will use mu_hat with recent_N=5 (Periods 3-7) to capture the most recent mean (~80), which balances the high early demand with the recent lower prints. sigma_hat will use the default to ensure sufficient safety stock during this stockout-prone phase.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/04/08. We are entering the spring season for a 'V-neck top in woven fabric', which typically sees peak demand from April through June. Historical demand analysis shows a recent average of ~95 units, though the last period spiked to 114. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 218 units in-transit (this includes the Period 3, 4, 8 orders, and likely Period 5 which was recently delivered but the history says 218 are still in transit - actually P3(35), P4(37), and P8(26) are accounted for, suggesting the balance of 'in-transit' includes pending arrivals). Lead times have been volatile (1-2 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to average these recent observations. For demand, I'll use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher spring baseline (~83 avg including the stock-out dip, but adjusting for lost sales suggests a higher true mean). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) will provide the OR engine with a more responsive estimate of current seasonal demand while account for the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio, which target a 50% service level.

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonality confirmed for Women's Vest Top category: Average true demand now exceeding 100 units/week. Lead time variability stabilized at an average of ~1.33 periods (based on P4, P6, P8 arrivals).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The product is a Women's Vest Top, which is in peak spring/early summer demand. Historical demand (including stockouts) shows a regime of roughly 90-110 units per week. The Period 1 order is confirmed lost. Recently, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P5 and P7 arrived in 1 period; P2 and P4 arrived in 2 periods). I will use a calculated lead time to reflect this variability. For demand forecasting, I'll use the last 5 periods (Period 5-9) to capture the current spring regime, being mindful that several periods (7, 8, 9) had restricted sales due to zero on-hand inventory, effectively under-representing true demand mean and variance. Using N=5 for both demand and sigma provides a balanced estimate while the pipeline (254 units) catches up to the stockouts.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in late April (2019/4/22), which is the peak season for a women's v-neck vest top. Current on-hand is 0, with 192 units in-transit. Looking at the history, demand has were consistently high (between 85-114, averaging ~92 over the last 6 periods despite stockouts limiting the 'sold' data). The Period 10 'conclude' message shows that orders from Period 8 and Period 9 arrived simultaneously (Lead times of 2 and 1 respectively). This confirms lead time is highly variable (average of last 5 shipments: 2, 1, 1, 2, 1 = 1.4 periods). To avoid frequent stockouts during this peak spring/summer season, I'm setting L to 2 (conservative) and using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent high-demand regime (mean ~92). The backend will then calculate mu_hat as (1+L)*mean_demand, providing enough coverage for the lead time and the review period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability continues: arrivals from Period 8 and 9 confirm actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. Average demand remains high (>90) as spring seasonality for women's vest tops persists.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (April 29), we continue to see strong demand for the Women's Vest Top, consistent with spring seasonality. Last period's demand reached 121, and the average since Period 8 is approximately 105. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts, with 246 units in-transit (orders from Period 10, which was 0, and Period 11, plus any older persistent orders). Reviewing recent lead times: P8 arrived in 2 periods, P9 in 1 period, P7 in 1 period, and P5 in 1 period. The average actual lead time is approximately 1.25. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this empirical lead time which is shorter than the promised 2. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~105) while ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level given the equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), we are in the peak period for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' vest top. Historical demand data from the last 12 periods shows an average of ~95 units, but we have experienced frequent stockouts due to late or lost shipments (P1 order of 120 units remains lost). Recent demand samples (P11=121, P12=76) suggest continued high volatility and volume. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P8 took 2, P9 took 1). To bridge the gap between promised (L=2) and actual behavior, I am using L=2 (promised) but setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher volume and standard deviation associated with the spring peak. This provides a base_stock that accounts for (1+L)=3 periods of demand to recover from the current zero on-hand inventory position, while acknowledging the 315 units currently in-transit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection' V-neck top, which is currently in its peak spring/early summer season (May 13). Demand remains strong but volatile, with a recent high of 121 in Period 11 followed by a dip to 52 in Period 13. Historical evidence suggests a seasonal average demand of approximately 90-100 units per week. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (average ~1.5). In Period 13, a shipment of 54 units arrived (2-period lead time), leaving 2 units on-hand after sales. There are 261 units in-transit (orders from Period 12 and any previous unfulfilled units like Period 3/4 if they were somehow delayed, though Period 12 is the primary driver). Given the profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, we target a 50% service level for the base stock, but the capped policy protects us. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current seasonal demand regime (approx 93 units/week) and 'calculate' for lead time to account for the observed 1-2 period variance.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019, representing the peak of spring/early summer for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' vest top. Historical demand data shows a mean of ~88 units, but the last 5 periods (P10-P14) have seen higher volatility (std ~28). Recent lead times (P11, P12) have settled back to the promised 2 periods, making the effective lead time calculation (L+1) equal to 3. I am using recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to capture the current seasonal regime and stabilized logistics. Mu_hat will use the last 10 samples to balance the early spring spikes with the more moderate recent demand (avg ~80 in last 4 periods). On-hand inventory is low (17), and there are 192 units in transit (likely from large orders placed in P13/P14 but not yet 'concluded' in the log as arrived). The parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the low $1 holding cost relative to the risk of stockouts during the summer peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's v-neck vest top, which typically sees high demand in late spring/early summer. Recent history shows a demand softening compared to April peaks (dropping from ~100+ to the 50-70 range in the last 3 periods), though stockouts in Periods 11-12 may have obscured true demand levels. We are currently stocked out with 225 units in-transit (orders from Periods 3 and 15, assuming Period 3 is a potential lost shipment while Period 15 is standard). Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. To recapture the demand curve without over-ordering as we move into summer, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand calculation to account for the most recent trend (periods 11-15), and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed 1.6 period average (calculated from all completed shipments: 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2).

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed from mid-May (Period 13-15): average demand dropped to ~54 units/week from previous highs of 90-100. Period 3 order (35 units) is now 12 periods overdue and likely lost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 3 (Period 17), we are transitioning from the spring peak to summer. Demand has significantly decreased from a peak of ~100 units/week to a consistent range of 54-57 units over the last four periods (Period 13-16). I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect this new lower demand regime. Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (average ~1.5); the OR backend will use the promised lead time of 2 by default, which is appropriate for safety. I continue to consider the Period 1 (120 units) and Period 3 (35 units) orders as lost, as they are 15 and 13 periods overdue respectively. The in-transit of 225 units consists of Period 15 (33 units), which is expected to arrive in Period 17 or 18, and the lost orders. By using recent_N for the demand forecasting, the OR engine will properly calculate a lower base stock to match current consumption levels and avoid overstocking as we enter June.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13: Average weekly demand dropped from ~95 to ~55 (-42%) as the initial spring peak for this vest top subsided. Period 3 order (35 units) is now officially categorized as lost (13 periods overdue).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18 (June 10). The item is a Women's Vest Top, which saw a peak in demand through April/May and has since transitioned into a lower stable regime. Demand from Period 13 to 17 has averaged approximately 51.8 units/week (52, 54, 55, 57, 41), confirming the shift noted in the Carry-over Insights (down from ~95). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 192 units in-transit. Looking at the history, orders from Period 1 (120 units) and Period 3 (35 units) are confirmed lost and should be disregarded. The remaining pipeline consists of orders placed recently (though the specific order numbers/dates aren't explicitly listed in the 'conclude' logs for the most recent 2 periods because they haven't arrived yet, the 'In-transit' figure of 192 is the net visible pipeline). Observed lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (average ~1.5). I will use N=5 for demand (covering the latest regime) and keep lead time at 'calculate' to reflect the variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712216001 (Women's Vest Top) has entered a stable, post-peak demand regime starting Period 13. Average demand from P13 to P18 is approximately 55.1 units, down significantly from the spring peak of ~95 units. Current lead times (excluding lost shipments) have stabilized near the promised 2 periods (actual observations: 2, 2, 2). On-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 192 units likely includes the lost shipment from Period 1 (120 units) and Period 3 (35 units), which I have officially discounted from availability in previous periods. Excluding those, the effective pipeline is 37 units. Given the low demand and high holding cost (equal to profit), the goal is to avoid overstocking in a declining or flat season. I will use a recent_N (N=6) to capture this new demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 2.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 712216001 (Women's Vest Top) is experiencing a mid-summer demand spike. Demand in Period 19 surged to 154 units, significantly higher than the previous 7-period average of ~70. This follows a period of demand softening in May. We are currently stocked out with 0 on-hand inventory and 192 units in-transit. The Carry-over insights confirm that orders from Period 1 (120 units) and Period 3 (35 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 192 - (120 + 35) = 37 units (which is the order from Period 4, which already arrived, wait... checking history). Correction: Period 1 and 3 were already noted as lost. The current 'In-transit' of 192 likely consists of recent orders that haven't arrived yet. Looking at recent concludes: P15 arrived in P17. There were no orders in P16-P19. The 192 units in-transit must be reconciled: If the system shows 192 in-transit and we haven't ordered since P15, and P1-P3 are lost, we must assume the system is still counting those lost units. Effective pipeline: 192 - (120+35) = 37 units. However, to re-establish stock for the current spike (154 units), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the upward trend since the May trough, and use explicit lead time of 2 to ensure the backend projects enough coverage for the current high-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand surge detected: Period 19 demand spiked to 154 units, breaking the previous 'softened' regime of ~55-70 units observed since Period 13.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. We are observing a significant summer demand spike for this Women's Vest Top, likely driven by high summer temperatures and vacations. Demand escalated from 154 units in Period 19 to 254 units in Period 20. This indicates a new high-demand regime, far exceeding the previous spring levels. The 'in-transit' total of 208 units likely includes recent aggressive orders (though the history only shows the most recent order of 16 units, the total pipeline reflects larger preceding orders not explicitly detailed in the prompt history). To capture this surge and avoid persistent stockouts during the peak season, I'm setting mu_hat using the most recent 3 samples (Periods 18-20, which average ~160 units/week) to aggressively adjust to the trend. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to account for the increased volatility seen in this transition from 72 to 254 demand units. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed starting Period 19: Demand jumped significantly from ~60 to 254 (+320%), reflecting peak seasonality for vest tops in July.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand summer peak for this SKU (Womens Vest Top), confirmed by demands of 154, 254, and 166 units over the last three periods (P19-P21). The average demand in this new regime is approximately 191 units per week. Although the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows variability (1-2 periods). Orders from P20 (16 units) and P21 (272 units) are currently in-transit; P20 is expected to arrive this period (P22) or next, and P21 is expected by P23. To prevent stockouts during this peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the summer surge. I will maintain the default lead time estimate of 2, as there is no conclusive evidence of a sustained shift away from the 1-2 period window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility observed during this seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak regime clearly established starting Period 19: mean weekly demand increased significantly to ~191 units from previous ~55-70 levels.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's Vest Top, currently in its peak summer demand regime (July). Beginning Period 19, demand surged significantly (154, 254, 166, 109). The mean demand over these 4 periods is 170.75 units. Although Period 22 dropped to 109, the context of mid-July suggests demand will remain high before the late-summer taper. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The pipeline inventory is high (558 units), primarily consisting of the large order from Period 21 (272 units) and Period 22 (94 units), plus the remnants of older shipments including the lost P1 (120) and P3 (35) orders. Excluding the lost 155 units (120+35), the active pipeline is 403 units. Since the backend OR uses 'In-transit' without excluding lost units, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the lead time (L=2) plus review period (1), which is (1+2)*170.75 = 512.25. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 will capture this 170.75 average. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's v-neck vest top, currently in the peak summer demand period (late July). A significant demand surge began in Period 19 (mid-June), with demand values of 154, 254, 166, 109, and 122. The most recent regime (P19-P23) has a mean demand of 161 units. Period 23 saw a large arrival (366 units), resulting in 244 units on-hand. Additionally, there are 192 units in-transit (ordered in P1, P3, and likely subsequent periods not yet concluded). However, as noted in carry-over insights, P1 (120 units) and P3 (35 units) orders are confirmed lost. Thus, effective pipeline inventory is 192 - 120 - 35 = 37 units. Current inventory (244 on-hand + 37 effective in-transit = 281) is being compared against a 3-period demand window (L=2, plus current period). Using recent_N=5 (P19-P23) for demand captures the current summer peak. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods based on P21 and P22 arrivals, but the backend 'calculate' method will best integrate the observed 1 and 2-period arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P19-P23) mean stabilized at ~161 units/week, down from the initial P20 spike but remaining well above the spring average.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Women's Vest Top', currently in late July (Period 25). Historical demand data and carry-over insights confirm a major summer demand regime shift that started around Period 19. Average demand for the last five periods (P20-P24) is approximately 166 units/week (254, 166, 109, 122, 180). Although the initial spike reached 254, the last four periods have stabilized at a mean of 144. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P21 arrived in 2 periods, P22 arrived in 1 period, both concluding in P23). Current on-hand is 64 units, with 47 units (ordered P24) in-transit. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand summer regime while adjusting for the observed volatility (sigma) within this peak period. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the historical average (approx 1.5-1.6 periods), which is appropriate given the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P19-P24) mean tracking at ~166 units/week. Lead time variability persists between 1-2 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5, 2019. The product is a Women's Vest Top, which is currently in its peak summer season. Period 25 demand was 112 units, and the mean demand for the summer peak regime (starting Period 19) is approximately 156 units per week. The SKU is currently stocked out (0 on-hand) after sold 64 units against 112 demand in Period 25. There are 435 units in-transit (orders from Period 24, 25, and potentially lost legacy orders from P1/P3, though the carry-over indicates those are discarded). To maintain service levels during this high-demand summer period while accounting for lead time variability (1-2 periods), I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the current 156 unit average. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to capture the observed 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand regime (P19-P25) mean is 156 units/week. Stockout occurred in Period 25 due to demand exceeding available on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. This SKU is a women's V-neck vest top, which has experienced a significant summer peak starting around Period 19. While the initial surge in July saw demand spikes over 200, the last few periods (P24-P26) show a cooling trend with demand values of 180, 112, and 83 respectively. This suggests the summer peak is tapering off as we move toward late August. The current on-hand inventory is 0, with a substantial pipeline of 471 units (including orders from P24, P25, and P26). Given the lead time variability (1-2 periods), these units are expected to arrive shortly. Using recent_N=6 for demand (capturing the summer regime from P21-P26) gives a mean of approximately 144 units. However, given the clear downward trend in the last three weeks (180 -> 112 -> 83), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a safer forecast that avoids over-ordering at the end of the season. I'll target an average of 110 units per week to reflect the transition out of the summer peak. Lead time is stabilized at approximately 1.5 periods based on recent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand tapering observed starting Period 24: Weekly demand decreased from summer peak highs (~180) to ~83 in Period 26, signaling the end of the peak summer season for vest tops.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear tapering from the summer peak (which averaged ~160 units/week) down to 83 units in Period 26 and 56 units in Period 27. This aligns with the seasonal lifecycle of a Women's Vest Top as the market transitions toward late summer/autumn. The Carry-over insight for Period 27 confirms this shift. Therefore, I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a recent_N window (N=3) to capture this downward trend (average of P25-P27 is ~84 units), which is more representative of the current regime than the long-term or peak summer average. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P25 arrived in 2 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability. On-hand inventory is 140 and in-transit is 275 (P26 order of 36 units + others), providing significant coverage given the decelerating demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 26: Weekly demand dropped from peak summer levels (~160) to ~70 units/week (avg P26-P27), indicating seasonal tapering for the vest top category.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. Demand for this Women's Vest Top has shifted into a post-summer tapering phase. After the peak in July (avg ~160), demand has dropped significantly to an average of 66 units over the last three periods (P26-P28: 83, 56, 59). In-transit inventory is currently 275 units (comprising Period 21: 272 and Period 26: 36), which is very high relative to the new demand regime. However, the Period 21 order (272 units) is extremely overdue (8 periods) and must be treated as a lost shipment, consistent with historical losses in Period 1 and Period 3. Excluding that lost shipment, active pipeline is only 36 units plus on-hand 81. Given the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the tapered demand profile (~66/week). L is set to calculate as actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Period 21 order (272 units) is 8 periods overdue and is officially treated as a lost shipment; removed from pipeline logic considerations.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. The product is a Women's Vest Top, which has completed its peak summer demand cycle (P19-P25 avg ~160). We are now in a post-summer tapering regime which began around P26. Demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 83, 56, 59, 54, averaging ~63 units/week. This aligns with seasonal expectations for a vest top as autumn approaches. Current On-hand is 27. There are 275 units in-transit: 47 from P24 (6 periods overdue, potentially lost), 196 from P25 (already arrived in P27), 36 from P26 (3 periods overdue, potentially lost). Note: The game history shows P25 arrival was 196 units in P27 conclude, but the 'In-transit' figure 275 suggests the system might still be counting P21 (lost), P24, or P26. Following the policy of treating P21 as lost (272 units) and observing the current 'In-transit' of 275, I will assume the backend accounts for P24(47), P26(36), and possibly P21 if not fully purged. However, for OR parameters, I will focus on the new demand regime (last 4 periods, N=4) and maintain the lead time at the promised 2 periods despite variability, as recent arrivals (P25) hit the 2-period mark.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime confirmed starting Period 26: Average weekly demand has stabilized at ~63 units (P26-P29), a significant drop from the summer peak (~160). Period 24 order (47 units) is now 6 periods overdue and potentially lost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. The SKU is a women's v-neck vest top, which has transitioned from its peak summer season (July/August) into a lower demand autumn regime. Analysis of demand since Period 26 shows a clear stabilization: demand values are 83, 56, 59, 54, 38. This confirms the 'post-summer' regime noted in previous insights, with an average of approximately 58 units/week. Inventory is currently 0, and we have 275 units in-transit (Period 26 order of 36 units and previous large orders). Note: Period 24 order (47 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is likely lost; however, the pipeline is still heavily saturated with the Period 21/25 cycles. Lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this seasonal decline, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the current lower mean (~58), and L=2 to ensure we cover the probable arrival window.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Lead time variability continues with Period 24 order (47 units) confirmed lost (7 periods overdue). Post-summer demand regime remains stable at ~58 units/week (P26-P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Women's Vest Tops' has entered a post-summer cooling phase. Following the peak summer period (P19-P25), demand shifted significantly downward starting around P26. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 46.6 units, with a clear downward trend (56, 59, 54, 38, 26). I will use a recent_N (N=6) to capture the start of this decline from P26 onwards. On lead times: the Period 24 order (47 units) is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost, aligning with previous carry-over insights. The Period 26 order (36 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it may also be lost or significantly delayed. Consequently, the 'In-transit' count of 275 units (likely comprising P21, P24, P26, etc.) includes heavily stale orders. Setting L=2 (promised) to stabilize procurement against known lead-time variability (1-2 periods) and using recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to reflect the current seasonal downturn.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline continues: P30-31 demand dropped below 40 units, suggesting the post-summer stable regime of ~60 identified in P31 is further softening as autumn approaches.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Women's Vest Top', which is highly seasonal. We have entered the autumn period (late September), and demand has dropped significantly from the summer peak (approx. 160 units/week) to a post-summer average of 60. Recent data from Periods 30-32 shows a further decline to an average of 28 units/week (38, 26, 20), indicating the end of the functional season for this product. We are currently holding 0 on-hand inventory but have 275 units in-transit (ordered in Period 26 and possibly earlier). One shipment (Period 24) is confirmed lost, but the Period 26 order (36 units) should arrive soon. Given the sharp downward trend as summer ends, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the latest softening (avg ~35) rather than the older post-summer 60-unit regime. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect the increased stability (lower variance) during this decline compared to the volatile summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 30: Weekly demand for vest tops has dropped significantly to ~28 units/week (P30-P32), down from the post-summer stable regime of ~60. This reflects the end of seasonal relevance for the product category.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Vest Top (712216001) has entered an autumn decline, confirmed by the 'Autumn demand regime shift' in Period 33. Demand over the last 4 periods (P30-P33) has averaged approximately 34.5 units (38, 26, 20, 54), a significant drop from the summer and post-summer levels. Although Period 33 saw a slight bump to 54, the overall trend is downward as the product loses seasonal relevance in late September. The in-transit pipeline contains a large order of 196 units from Period 25 that arrived in P27, but current on-hand is 0. There is currently 275 units listed as 'In-transit', but checking history: P25 (196 units) arrived P27; P26 (36 units) is 8 periods overdue and likely lost; P21 was already cleared as lost. The 275 'In-transit' likely includes these lost shipments. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and low demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand level (N=4, P30-P33) and maintain a standard lead time setup to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal wind-down.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. The product is a Women's Vest Top, which is a highly seasonal summer item. We are currently in an 'Autumn' demand regime that began around Period 30, with demand averaging approximately 31 units/week (P30-P34: 38, 26, 20, 54, 22). This is a significant drop from the post-summer regime of ~60 and the summer peak of ~160. There is currently an 'in-transit' balance of 275 units. This is primarily composed of the Period 21 order (272 units) and Period 26 order (36 units). However, the Period 21 order has been officially treated as lost since Period 29. Furthermore, the Period 24 (47 units) and Period 26 (36 units) orders are significantly overdue (11 and 9 periods respectively) and should be considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With on-hand inventory also at 0, we must order to meet the new lower demand regime. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the current autumn demand levels (~31 units/week). Lead time remains variable between 1-2 periods; I'll use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter transition confirmed: Weekly demand for vest tops has stabilized at a low level of ~31 units (P30-P34). Overdue shipments from P24 (47 units) and P26 (36 units) are now considered lost after 9+ periods of no arrival.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. This SKU (Womens Vest Top) has entered a low-demand autumn/winter regime. Since Period 30, demand has averaged ~26 units/week (sum(38, 26, 20, 54, 22, 11)/6), reflecting seasonal irrelevance. The pipeline inventory shows 275 units in-transit, which comprises late orders or potentially lost shipments. Specifically, the orders from P24 (47 units) and P26 (36 units) are now 11 and 9 periods overdue respectively, making them almost certainly lost. However, there are also 'in-transit' units that likely represent the system's reaction to previous stockouts or demand spikes. Given on-hand is 0 and demand is very low (~30/week), we do not need significant new orders. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the current autumn regime (approx 30 units/week * (1+L)) using recent_N=6 to capture the post-summer drop accurately. L is set to calculate to handle the observed variable lead times of 1-2 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's Vest Top, which is highly seasonal. We are now in late October (Period 37), and demand has predictably dropped to very low levels (~11 units/week for the last two periods) as the autumn/winter season takes over. The historical demand shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 30, with the most recent data (P35-P36) indicating a further decline. The 'In-transit' quantity of 275 units is significantly higher than any projected demand for the remainder of the year and likely includes older shipments that are either extremely delayed or lost (specifically the P24 and P26 orders mentioned in carry-overs). However, even if only a fraction of that pipeline arrives, it will vastly exceed the current demand of ~11-15 units/week. Given the current on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is huge (275), the OR backend will naturally stop ordering as long as the base stock (calculated from mu_hat) is less than the pipeline. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) to reflect the current low-demand environment (~24 units per week including the P33 spike, or ~11 units recently). Using N=5 captures the downward trend while maintaining some safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter regime confirmed: Demand has dropped to ~11 units/week in mid-October, confirming the end of seasonal relevance for vest tops.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's V-neck vest top, which is highly seasonal. We are now in Period 38 (late October), and historical demand from the 'Autumn/Winter Transition' (Period 30 onwards) confirms a significant drop in demand. The most recent demand samples (P35-P37) are 11, 11, and 16 units, confirming a very low-demand regime (~13 units/week). In-transit inventory is currently 275 units, though 'Carry-over Insights' suggest some of this might be lost shipments from earlier periods (P21, P24, P26 are likely lost). However, even assuming only the most recent orders are valid, the pipeline far exceeds the current demand of ~13 units/week. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), and the season for vest tops has ended, we must minimize additional ordering to avoid excessive holding costs on dead stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (covering the stable late-autumn low) and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect historical variability.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter low-demand regime confirmed (P35-P37): Average demand has stabilized at approximately 13 units/week, down from ~31 in the early autumn transition.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 39 (early November). The product is a Women's V-neck vest top, which has entered its absolute low-demand season (Autumn/Winter). The demand regime has stabilized at a very low level: the average demand from Period 35 to 38 is approximately 14.5 units per week. The inventory situation shows 0 on-hand and an 'in-transit' figure of 275 units. However, looking at the history, this 'in-transit' likely consists of the lost shipments from Period 21 (272 units) and other smaller remnants from summer orders that never arrived. Since the actual demand is extremely low and the product is seasonally irrelevant, I will continue to order 0 by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approximately 15 units/week) while keeping a standard lead time estimate. The OR backend will see the stale 'in-transit' (275) and a low base stock (based on ~15 units/week), resulting in no new orders, which is the correct strategy to avoid holding costs for an out-of-season item.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019, which is late autumn/early winter. The product is a Women's Vest Top with spaghetti straps, a highly seasonal item that has reached the end of its relevance. Demand has stabilized at a very low level: the last 5 periods (P35-P39) show demand of 11, 11, 16, 20, and 8 units, averaging 13.2 units/week. This confirms the 'Late Autumn/Winter' regime identified in Period 38. There is a massive pipeline inventory of 275 units (likely resulting from a late-season order or a system quirk, as no new orders were placed since P26 according to history, yet 'In-transit' shows 275). Given the current on-hand is 0 and the pipeline (275) is already far in excess of the expected demand for the remainder of the season (approx 13 units/week), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent low-demand regime (N=5) to prevent any further ordering. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed lead time variability, although it will not trigger new orders given the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Late Autumn/Winter low-demand regime persistent (P35-P39); average demand ~13.2 units/week. Significant pipeline surplus relative to seasonal tail demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is late autumn/early winter. The product is a Women's Vest Top, which has clear negative seasonality in this period. Historical demand from the late autumn/winter regime (P35-P40) shows a stable, low average of approximately 11.8 units/week (11, 11, 16, 20, 8, 5). The pipeline inventory of 275 units is vastly disproportionate to this demand level, even assuming significant lead time delays or potential losses. Given the seasonality and the massive 'In-transit' stock (representing ~23 weeks of current demand), the objective is to prevent any further ordering and deplete existing stock as arrivals occur. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime, while L is set to default as the system's pipeline exceeds any reasonably forecastable demand (L+1 periods).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's Vest Top, currently in late November (Winter). Demand has stabilized at a very low level consistent with the 'Late Autumn/Winter' regime identified in Period 37. The average demand from Period 35 to 41 is approximately 11.6 units per week. There is currently an in-transit pipeline of 275 units (from orders placed during earlier, higher-demand periods that have not yet arrived or were potentially delayed/lost). Given the current holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), and the remaining game duration is only 6 periods, the existing pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the total remaining life-cycle demand (approx. 70 units). No further orders are required. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to reflect the current low-demand regime (Periods 35-41).

Carry-over insight: Winter low-demand regime for Women's Vest Top continues (P35-P41): average demand has decreased further to ~11.6 units/week. Pipeline inventory of 275 units significantly exceeds remaining lifecycle demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Women's Vest Top', currently in Period 43 (early December). Demand has consistently trended downward since the summer peak (P19-P25) and autumn transition, now averaging ~15 units per week over the last 8 periods (P35-P42). There is currently an in-transit pipeline of 275 units, which originates from an order in Period 21 that was previously categorized as lost but may physically arrive if lead times are severely extended, or theoretically remains in the system calculation. Given the extremely low seasonal demand for v-neck vest tops in December and the massive pipeline relative to current sales (275 units vs ~15 demand), no further ordering is required. We maintain parameters to prevent unnecessary procurement while satisfying the minimal remaining lifecycle demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter regime for Women's Vest Top (P35-P42) confirmed: mean demand ~15.2 units/week, reflects total seasonal irrelevance. Massive pipeline surplus (275 units) exists relative to remaining lifecycle.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a Women's Vest Top, which is currently in its off-season (December). Demand has consistently been low, with the winter regime (P35-P43) averaging approximately 16.6 units per week. Although there were slight upticks in P42 (41 units) and P43 (28 units), these are likely minor noise or clearance-driven rather than a sustained trend shift. Crucially, the system shows 275 units in-transit. These units are extremely overdue (P21, P24, P25, and P26 orders are all significantly past their expected arrival dates). However, if even a small portion of this pipeline arrives, it will far exceed the remaining lifecycle demand for this season. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), and the fact that we are in Period 44 of 47, the priority is to avoid any new orders. I will use a recent_N (N=9, covering P35-P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand winter state, and the default lead time (2). The massive pipeline relative to low demand will naturally prevent the OR backend from placing further orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Collection V-neck vest top', which is highly seasonal. We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December), and the game ends at Period 47. Historical demand analysis shows a clear late-season decline: the early autumn regime (P30-P34) averaged ~31 units/week, while the winter regime (P35-P44) has dropped to ~17 units/week, with the most recent sample at only 3 units. There are 275 units in-transit (orders from Period 21, 24, 25, 26 were mostly considered lost but the in-transit field still tracks them). Even if a small portion of that pipeline arrives, it will more than cover the remaining demand for these last two periods. My objective is to prevent any further unnecessary inventory accumulation and minimize holding costs, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), making overstocking as penalized as understocking. I will set the lead time to default and use the most recent 10 samples to reflect the current low-demand winter state.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 47 (December 23rd). The product 'Women's Everyday Vest Top' is in its terminal seasonal phase. Historical demand since Period 35 has averaged approximately 17.5 units per week, with periodic spikes (likely related to holiday sales or clearing). The pipeline reflects 'In-transit: 275 units', which is an artifact of earlier periods where shipments from Period 21 (272) and others were flagged as lost in the Carry-Over Insights but remain in the 'in-transit' accounting until the end of the simulation. With only one period remaining (P47), and given that on-hand inventory is 0 while demand remains at a low winter baseline, any new order placed now (L=2) would not arrive before the simulation ends. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure no further orders are placed to avoid holding costs on inventory that cannot be sold within the game horizon.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the final period of the game for this Women's Vest Top SKU. The product is highly seasonal (Spring/Summer), and demand has remained at a persistent low-level 'Winter' regime since Period 35, averaging ~20 units/week with significant late-season volatility (observed demand of 56 in Period 45 vs 3 in Period 44). Current status shows 0 on-hand and 275 units in-transit. These in-transit units are from orders placed during the summer peak (e.g., Period 21, 24, 26) that were flagged as likely lost but haven't been 'concluded' by the system. Given that this is the final period and the pipeline (275 units) already massively exceeds any possible demand for one period, the goal is to avoid any further orders which would only incur holding costs or contribute to excess stock. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime and minimize order triggering.
