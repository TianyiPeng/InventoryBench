Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows values of 46, 33, 53, 37, and 21. There is a visible downward trend in the last sample (Feb 4: 21), which might reflect the post-holiday/post-January slump, though necklaces can see a minor Valentine's day uplift. Since this is the first decision period, on-hand and in-transit are both 0. The promised lead time (L) is 2. I will use the recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=5 to capture the most recent activity while maintaining enough data for a stable variance estimate. For L, I will use 'default' (2 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a thin metal chain necklace. From the historical samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand was [46, 33, 53, 37, 21], with a mean of 38. The demand in Period 1 was 26, continuing a downward trend from early February. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, 59 units were ordered, which are currently 'In-transit' and expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order has not arrived yet. To bridge the gap until the Period 1 order arrives (Period 3), we need to ensure our base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. Given L=2, we target 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (the historical samples + Period 1) to estimate demand, as the recent samples better reflect the current post-January average (~35) than the longer-term average. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (base_stock - in_transit).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Looking at the demand history (samples + Periods 1 & 2), we see: 46, 33, 53, 37, 21 (samples) and 26, 23 (observed). The average demand is approximately 34.14 units/period, with no significant seasonal spike detected in February for this accessory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (59 units) and P2 (55 units) are currently 'In-transit' (total 114). Per the lead time definition, the P1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of P4. Thus, seeing 0 on-hand and 0 arrivals in P2's conclude is expected. Currently, on-hand is 0, so we have lost sales in P1 and P2. To recover and cover the pipeline (L+1 = 3 periods of demand), we target a base stock around ~102 units. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to weigh the most recent demand samples and observations equally, ensuring the OR backend targets the (1+L) period horizon.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-04 (Period 4). The item is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (59 units), Period 2 (55 units), and Period 3 (23 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (ordered P1, L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests either a delay in the supply chain or that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 137 units in transit. Demand has been 26, 23, 14 in the last three periods, with pre-game samples showing a mean of ~38. The drop in the last three periods (mean ~21) might be a temporary dip or a new regime. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay of the P1 order and use the last 5 samples (including pre-game) to estimate demand (mu_hat) to balance the high pre-game demand with the recent lower observations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Historical demand samples (Pre-game) were: 46, 33, 53, 37, 21 (Avg: 38). In-game demand (P1-P4) has been: 26, 23, 14, 4 (Avg: 16.75). There is a significant downward trend in demand over the last 4 weeks. Looking at arrivals: The P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). The P1 order (59 units) is overdue (promised L=2, now P5 and no conclude). This suggests the P1 order may be lost. The P3 order (23 units) is expected to arrive during P5. Currently, we have 51 units on hand and 82 in-transit (assuming P1 and P3). Because demand is dropping sharply and we have significant inventory relative to recent sales, I am lowering the demand forecast. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the recent low demand and use calculate for L as the one observed arrival matches the promised lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a thin metal necklace. Historical demand analysis shows a pre-launch/early season variance (46, 33, 53, 37, 21), while recent post-launch performance (Periods 1-5) shows lower realize demand (26, 23, 14, 4, 12). Lead time reconciliation: The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). The Period 1 order (59 units) is overdue and likely lost as it hasn't arrived by Period 5 (L=4 would have been the limit). We have 39 on-hand and 82 in-transit (reflecting the likely lost P1 order of 59 and the active P3 order of 23). Due to the likely loss of 59 units, we must ensure parameters cover replenishment. Demand appears to be stabilizing at a lower level than the pre-history suggests. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand to weigh the actual observed sales more heavily than the pre-launch samples, and set L to default (2) as the one successful arrival confirmed the promised lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Reviewing the performance: In Period 4, the order from Period 2 arrived (lead_time=2). The order from Period 1 (59 units) remains missing after 6 periods, suggesting it is likely lost. The order from Period 3 (23 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5 or 6 but hasn't appeared in the 'conclude' messages yet. Demand has shown a significant drop since Period 4 (values: 26, 23, 14, 4, 12, 10). The early samples (46, 33, 53, 37, 21) suggested a mean ~38. The recent 3 weeks (Periods 4-6) show a much lower mean of ~8.7. Given the current on-hand inventory of 29 and in-transit units of 82 (likely the lost 59 + the pending 23), we are overstocked relative to the new low-demand regime. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to reflect this demand drop and prevent over-ordering while waiting for the pipeline to clear or be marked as lost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 4: Mean demand dropped from ~38 to ~9 per period. Period 1 order (59 units) is likely lost as of Period 7 (5 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $551.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand spiked to 47 in Period 7, exhausting stock. The demand history shows a high initial mean (~38 in pre-game samples), followed by a lower regime (avg ~8.6 for Periods 4-6), and a sudden spike back to 47 in Period 7. This volatility makes the 'recent_N' approach dangerous if N is too large; I will use the last 4 periods (Periods 4-7) to capture the recent low and the sudden high (mean ~18.25). Regarding logistics: The Period 1 order (59 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). The Period 2 order (55 units) arrived on time in Period 4. The Period 3 order (23 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since ordered) and likely lost. The 82 units currently 'In-transit' represent these likely lost shipments (59+23=82). Since the OR backend counts all 'In-transit' against the target, it will not place new orders despite the likely loss. To force the OR backend to order, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' 2 (standard) but set 'mu_hat' significantly higher than current demand to overcome the 'In-transit' anchor. However, a better strategy to handle phantom inventory is to boost mu_hat to cover the expected demand plus the 'ghost' inventory. With 82 units in phantom transit and a target service level high (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I'll set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock and the anticipated demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 order (23 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Total 'ghost' pipeline inventory is now 82 units (P1: 59, P3: 23). Demand exhibits high volatility, swinging from avg 8.6 to 47 in one week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product 'Flirty Linnea necklace' is out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit units are 165, but significant issues exist: The orders from Period 1 (59 units) and Period 3 (23 units) are over 5 periods old and are confirmed lost (82 'ghost' units). Actual pipeline is only 83 units ordered in Period 8. Demand has shifted: after a low-demand regime (avg ~9 in P4-P6), demand spiked to 47 and 42 in P7-P8, likely due to spring/Easter seasonality. I need to account for the lost inventory to force the OR backend to place an order, as the backend incorrectly believes we have 165 units incoming. I will set mu_hat to cover the recent higher demand (last 3 periods avg = 33) and lead time L. Using L=2 and recent_N=3 for demand parameters. To offset the 82 ghost units, I will explicitly set mu_hat higher to trigger an order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Spring peak started Period 7 (avg demand ~44 vs previous low of ~9). Cumulative lost inventory (ghost units) remains 82 (P1: 59, P3: 23). Actual in-transit is 83 units (from P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The 'Flirty Linnea necklace' has transitioned into a Spring demand regime which started around Period 7. Demand over the last 3 periods has been significantly higher (47, 42, 28) with an average of ~39 units/period, compared to the low-demand trough of ~9 units/period observed in Periods 4-6. Lead-time analysis: Promised L=2. Period 2 order arrived exactly at L=2. However, Period 1 (59 units) and Period 3 (23 units) orders are clearly lost (over 6 periods elapsed), totaling 82 'ghost' units in the pipeline. Current total in-transit is 239, but 82 are lost, so effective in-transit is 157 (from orders in P8 and P9). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the current Spring surge (~39/wk), and explicit L=2 accounts for the promised and observed successful lead time. The OR engine needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 117 units). Given the effective pipeline (157 units) already exceeds this, the parameters protect against stockouts once those orders arrive while accounting for lost history.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime for necklaces confirmed: Average demand ~39 units/period since Period 7 (47, 42, 28). Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 82 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Thin metal chain necklace) is currently in its spring demand phase. In the last four periods (P7-P10), demand has been 47, 42, 28, and 21 (average ~34.5). The most recent demand (21) indicates the peak might be tapering, but we must maintain stock to cover the promised 2-period lead time. Reconciliation: The system reports 82 units in-transit, which matches exactly the 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in Period 1 (59) and Period 3 (23). No new physical units are actually in-transit. On-hand inventory is healthy at 136 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of the current average demand. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the target base stock, the presence of 82 'ghost' units will lead it to under-order unless we compensate. However, with 136 units on-hand and demand settling around 25-30 units, the current stock is sufficient for the next 2-3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the spring regime's mean and volatility while letting the 82 units remain in pipeline as they are effectively 'lost' and the OR engine needs to know they won't arrive.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 82 units is confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P1: 59, P3: 23). Actual physical In-transit is 0. On-hand inventory of 136 units is sufficient to cover 4+ weeks of current demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a thin metal necklace. We are in a confirmed 'spring peak' demand regime that started around Period 7, although the last two weeks have shown a cooling trend (21 and 15 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 28.6 units. On-hand inventory is 121 units, and the 82 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (ordered in P1 and P3, over 8 periods ago). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units (including these ghost units) from the base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat to offset this. Specifically, I set L to the promised lead time (2) and mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the 82 ghost units. Expected demand per period is ~28; thus for 3 periods, we need ~84 units. Adding the 82 ghost units gives a target mu_hat of 166. With 121 on-hand, the backend calculation [base_stock (166+) - pipeline (82) = 84+] will reconcile correctly against the physical reality. No order will likely be placed as on-hand (121) > target (84).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak cooling: Demand has decreased for two consecutive periods (21, 15) from the spring peak average of 44.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace' has trended downward over the last three periods (21, 15, 9 units), confirming a cooldown following the April 'Spring peak'. The average demand over the last 3 periods is 15 units. Current on-hand inventory is 112 units, which is high relative to the current demand trend (covering ~7 weeks). There are 84 units in 'In-transit', but 82 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from Period 1 and Period 3 that never arrived. The effective physical in-transit is only 2 units (ordered in Period 12). Since the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, keeping the ghost units in the pipeline tally will prevent unnecessary ordering while we burn through the excess on-hand stock. However, to ensure the backend uses the correct demand forecast for this cooling phase, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (covering the decline from 21 down to 9) to capture the lower demand mean (~13.25) and reduce holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: 3-period decline (21, 15, 9) indicates the end of the Spring peak. Total ghost inventory remains 82 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are observing a post-spring peak demand phase for the Flirty Linnea necklace. Demand in the last four periods has been 21, 15, 9, and 28 (mean: 18.25), showing a significant decline from the earlier peak average of ~44. The currently reported 'In-transit' of 84 units consists of 82 'ghost' units (P1: 59, P3: 23) which are confirmed lost, plus an order of 2 units from P12 (which is within lead time). On-hand inventory is 84 units. Given the desired service level (z* \u2248 2.17 for profit=19, holding=1), the current on-hand inventory of 84 units is already sufficient to cover over 4 weeks of the current demand (avg 18.25). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 82 ghost units as valid future supply, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent low demand to suppress new orders until inventory naturally depletes. I am using the last 4 periods (N=4) to define the new 'normalized' low regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower post-peak level: avg 18.25 units/period (last 4 weeks). Ghost inventory remains at 82 units, erroneously inflated 'In-transit' counts.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15 (2019/5/20), we observe a significant demand spike of 69 units in Period 14, which contradicts the previous 'cooling' trend (9, 28). This suggests a late spring or pre-summer surge for this necklace SKU. Current on-hand inventory is thin (17 units), and the 'In-transit' count of 82 units is entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1 and 3 (59 + 23), which are long lost. Because the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, it will not place a necessary order unless we override the parameters. To ensure we stock up for the current high demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods (L+1) at an estimated 45 units/period (reflecting the recent spike and seasonal relevance). sigma_hat is set high to account for the extreme volatility (69 vs 9 in recent weeks). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P8, P9, P12) have mostly followed the promised 2-period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike: Period 14 saw a surge to 69 units, reversing the previous cooling trend. Current 'In-transit' of 82 units remains confirmed as lost 'ghost' inventory from P1 and P3.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Flirty Linnea necklace) experienced a massive demand spike in Period 15 (136 units), far exceeding previous peaks (69 units). This matches the 'Spring/Early Summer' accessory seasonality. On-hand inventory is now 0. The current 'In-transit' of 170 units is composed of: 59 (P1 - lost), 23 (P3 - lost), and 88 (ordered P15). Thus, physical pipeline is only 88 units. To prevent consecutive stockouts during this high-demand regime, mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the sudden 2019-05 surge (Period 13-15 avg: ~77 units/period). This provides a more aggressive replenishment target than the cumulative average. Lead time remains standard at 2 periods. L is set to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure the OR backend ignores the noise of lost/delayed orders in the 'In-transit' count and focuses on the current lead time reality.

Carry-over insight: Massive seasonal demand spike confirmed: Period 15 demand reached 136 units (+97% vs P14). 3-period demand average (P13-15) is 77.7 units. Total 'ghost' inventory remains 82 units (P1, P3).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is experiencing a massive seasonal demand spike, likely due to early June summer shopping (Date: 2019/6/3). Demand in the last three periods has been 69, 136, and 130 units, compared to a previous baseline of ~20-40. The current 'In-transit' of 338 units includes orders from P15 (88) and P16 (168), plus the 82 'ghost' units from P1 and P3. Netting out the ghost units, we have 256 units of real stock expected to arrive in P17 and P18. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and demand is averaging ~133 in the last two weeks, we need to ensure the OR backend sets a high enough base stock to match this new regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the spike (average 111.6 units per week) and L at the promised 2. This will result in a base stock calculated over 3 weeks (L+1), or roughly 335 units. Given the pipeline inventory is 256 (338-82), this will trigger additional ordering to cover the likely sustained high demand through June.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed: Demand surged to avg 112 units/period starting Period 14, a 280% increase over the previous stable regime. Expected real pipeline inventory is 256 units (In-transit - 82 ghost units).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Flirty Linnea necklace) is in a high-demand Summer peak. Current period is June 10, 2019. Over the last 4 periods (P14-P17), demand has been 69, 136, 130, and 115, averaging 112.5 units/period. On-hand inventory is 141. The 'In-transit' figure is 185, but 82 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments in P1 (59) and P3 (23), meaning real pipeline inventory is 103 (ordered in P17). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P16 arrived in 1, P15 in 2). To maintain a high service level during this peak while acknowledging the OR engine's inability to see 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) using the recent average of ~112 units. mu_hat = (1+2)*112 = 336. sigma_hat will be set high to account for recent volatility (std dev of P14-P17 is ~30, so sqrt(3)*30 \u2248 52). L remains at default (2).

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand sustained for 4 periods (Avg: 112.5). Cumulative lost 'ghost' inventory remains 82 units (P1, P3), continuously inflating system 'In-transit' counts.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Flirty Linnea necklace) is in a sustained Summer peak. Demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) has been 69, 136, 130, 115, and 102, averaging 110.4 units/period. The current date is June 17, which aligns with peak seasonal jewelry demand. On-hand inventory is low (39 units), significantly below the current weekly average demand. There is a persistent 'ghost' inventory of 82 units (P1: 59 units, P3: 23 units) that has never arrived and appears lost; this erroneously inflates the system 'In-transit' count to 281. The real pipeline inventory consists of the orders from P17 (103 units) and P18 (96 units), totaling 199 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P16 arrived in 1 period, P15 in 2 periods). To account for the 'ghost' units, mu_hat is set using an explicit value that covers (1+L) periods of peak demand (110 units/period * 3 = 330) plus an adjustment for the 82 units the OR backend mistakenly believes it has, totaling 412 units. This ensures the backend places an order sufficient to maintain service levels despite the data noise.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Flirty Linnea necklace) is experiencing a high-demand summer regime. Period 19 demand dropped to 43 from a 4-period average of 112.5, which likely indicates a retraction after the mid-June peak (possibly post-Solstice). However, demand remains significantly higher than the spring average (~18). Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P18 arrived in 1, P17 is still in transit after 2). Total system 'In-transit' is 353, but 82 are confirmed 'ghost' units (P1: 59, P3: 23). Real pipeline: 353 - 82 = 271 units (P17: 103, P19: 168). On-hand is 92. Total real stock (OH + Real IT) = 363. Given the drop in P19, N is set to 5 for mu_hat to capture the elevated summer mean (~99) while respecting the recent slowdown. Sigma is set to explicit to account for the high volatility seen in the transition from 102 down to 43.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high during summer peak: Period 19 saw a 58% drop from the previous 4-period mean (from 112.5 down to 43). Real pipeline corrected for 82 ghost units is 271.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are navigating a high-demand summer regime for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. The recent four-period demand (115, 102, 43, 48) shows a notable softening compared to the peak mid-May/June levels, with the mean dropping from ~112 to ~77 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 44 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported at 353 units, but 82 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments in Period 1 (59) and Period 3 (23). The true pipeline inventory consists of the Period 17 order (103 units - now 4 periods old and likely lost or significantly delayed), the Period 19 order (168 units - expected to arrive this period given recent 1-2 period lead times), and nothing from Period 20. Accounting for the 82 ghost units and the 103 units from Period 17 (which is 2 periods past promised lead time), the functional pipeline is roughly 168 units. To avoid over-ordering while respecting the summer demand levels, I will use a recent_N (N=6) approach for demand to capture the shift from the 130s to the 40s/50s, and stick with the default lead time. mu_hat will use the last 6 periods to reflect the current cooled summer demand (~77 avg).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand regime cooling continues. 4-period average is ~77 units, down from the 112 peak. Period 17 order (103 units) is now 2 periods overdue and potentially a new 'ghost' shipment, further inflating In-transit counts by 103 units in addition to the original 82. Real expected arrival is the Period 19 order (168 units).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. Demand for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace' is cooling following a major summer peak (which averaged ~112 units/period). The most recent 4-period demand average is 47.75 units (43, 48, 60, and 40 from the start of the simulation data for the current season). Pipeline reconciliation is critical: the system shows 359 units in-transit. Based on historical data, this includes 82 'ghost' units (P1: 59, P3: 23). Additionally, the order from Period 17 (103 units) is now 4 periods overdue and is likely lost, bringing total 'ghost' inventory to 185 units (82 + 103). The actual expected arrival is the Period 19 order (168 units) and the small Period 21 order (6 units), totaling 174 'real' in-transit units. On-hand is currently 0. Given the high volatility and service level requirements (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period average (approx 48) to avoid over-ordering during the cooling phase while accounting for the likely loss of the P17 shipment. I use explicit lead time of 3 to account for the frequent delays/losses observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Period 17 order (103 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Total cumulative 'ghost' inventory is now 185 units (P1: 59, P3: 23, P17: 103). System 'In-transit' counts must be mentally discounted by 185 to find real pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 23 (July 15). We are coming off a high Summer demand regime. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 22 was 99, and the last 4 periods average 62.5 units/period. The System In-transit is 359 units. However, we have confirmed 'ghost' (lost) shipments from P1 (59), P3 (23), and P17 (103), totaling 185 ghost units. Real pipeline = 359 - 185 = 174 units. These real units are from P19 (168 units) and P21 (6 units). Since common Lead Time (L) observed is 1-2 periods, the P19 order is now overdue (placed P19, currently P23 start). The P21 order is currently within promised lead time (L=2). To account for the risk that the P19 order might also be lost (as P17 was), I will set L to recent_N (3) to reflect the recent instability in delivery and use an explicit mu_hat. mu_hat is calculated for (1+L)=4 periods. Based on the recent cooling average of ~62.5, mu_hat = 4 * 62.5 = 250. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (5) to capture recent high volatility (99, 60, 48, 43, 102).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Potential risk on Period 19 order (168 units) being lost, as it is 1 period past promised lead time with no conclusion. This follows the pattern of the lost Period 17 order.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. We are in a high-demand summer regime for this necklace SKU, though stockouts have significantly hampered sales recently. There is a critical replenishment issue: the system 'In-transit' count of 353 units is largely comprised of lost 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P1 (59), P3 (23), P17 (103), and now likely P19 (168) have not arrived. P19 is now 5 periods old (well past the 2-period promised lead time), and historically, if an order doesn't arrive by L+2, it's lost. This means 59+23+103+168 = 353 units are 'ghosts'. We currently have 0 on-hand and 0 real units in transit. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged ~65 units (excluding the P21 stockout period where demand was 99/76). I will estimate mu_hat using the most recent 10 samples to capture the summer volatility (~71/period) and set L to 2. However, since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from base stock, and the system believes we have 353 units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force an order. I want a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock. Target base stock = 3 * 75 (forecast) + safety buffer \u2248 300. To trigger the OR engine to order approximately 300 units while it thinks 353 are coming, I will set mu_hat to a very high value. Since the OR engine caps orders at \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + buffer, setting an extremely high explicit mu_hat will hit the cap and maximize the order to refill the empty pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Cumulative lost 'ghost' inventory confirmed at 353 units. This includes P1 (59), P3 (23), P17 (103), and now P19 (168), as P19 is 5 periods overdue. System 'In-transit' of 353 is entirely comprised of these lost units; real in-transit is 0 and on-hand is 0.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (late July), the SKU is experiencing severe supply chain instability. The system shows 775 units In-transit, but historical evidence confirms 353 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1: 59, P3: 23, P17: 103, P19: 168). A large order of 422 units was placed last period (P24) and is expected to arrive by P26/P27. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has transitioned from a high summer peak (avg ~112) to a cooler July phase (last 2 periods demand: 76, 21), averaging 48.5 over the last two weeks. Due to the high risk of further shipment losses and the current stockout, I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for potential delays and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current cooling demand trend while maintaining enough safety stock to handle volatility (recent demands: 60, 99, 76, 21). This approach aims to bridge the stockout gap and ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for both the 422 units actually in transit and the 353 units that are lost.

Carry-over insight: Physical stockout confirmed at Period 25. High probability of P24 order (422 units) being the only real pipeline inventory; total cumulative ghost inventory remains 353 units. Demand cooling trend confirmed in July (avg ~48 units/period).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), the SKU 743098002 is experiencing a physical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 775 units 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation confirms that 353 of these are 'ghost units' from lost shipments (P1: 59, P3: 23, P17: 103, P19: 168). Therefore, the real pipeline consists of the Period 24 order (422 units). Demand has cooled significantly from the summer peak, averaging 48 units/period in July, but the most recent two weeks (P24-P25) saw a further drop to an average of 16.5 units. Given the potential for erratic recovery and the current stockout, I will set mu_hat using the mean of the last 6 periods (~52 units/period) to balance against the recent low but ensure coverage for a modest rebound. Sigma_hat is set relatively high (explicit value 60) to account for recent volatility and the risk of further lost shipments. The lead time L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the observed average (approx 1.7 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: July average ~48 units/period (P21-P25). Most recent 2-week demand (P24-P25) dropped further to 16.5 units/period. Real pipeline remains only the P24 order of 422 units; cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) is 353 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/08/12), the SKU is in a post-summer cooling phase. Demand over the last 3 periods has dropped significantly (avg ~16.7) compared to the summer peak (avg ~112). Historical ghost shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19) total 353 units. Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' of 775 leaves 422 units, which is the order placed in Period 24. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is currently at its expected arrival window and should arrive during Period 27/28 to resolve the 0 on-hand inventory. Given the observed cooling trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6, covering the shift from peak to trough in July/August) to prevent over-ordering as the season ends. Explicit Lead Time is kept at 2 to represent the current expectation for real shipments.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand cooling confirmed: July/August average dropped to ~31 units (P21-P26), with the most recent 3 weeks (P24-P26) averaging ~16.7 units. Cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 353 units (P1, P3, P17, P19). Real pipeline corresponds to P24 order (422 units).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/19. Demand analysis shows a significant cooling trend following the summer peak (P14-P20). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P24-P27) is approximately 21.5 units, down from over 100 units/period during the peak. Inventory management is complicated by significant lost shipments. Cumulative 'ghost' inventory is confirmed at 353 units (P1: 59, P3: 23, P17: 103, P19: 168). The system reports 775 units In-transit. Subtracting the 353 ghost units leaves 422 units, which is exactly the order placed in Period 24. This order is now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2), which is concerning given the history of lost shipments. However, on-hand inventory is 0, so if P24 is also lost, we are in a total stockout. To protect against the high risk of P24 being lost while acknowledging the lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 (covering the shift to lower demand) and L as explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays/losses seen in recent history. This should trigger a small safety order if the OR engine perceives the 422 \u2018real\u2019 units as overdue or insufficient for the current demand risk.

Carry-over insight: System in-transit of 775 contains 353 confirmed ghost units (P1, P3, P17, P19). Period 24 order (422 units) is 2 periods overdue and at high risk of being lost, following the pattern of P17 and P19.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the product is in a deep stockout. The system 'In-transit' of 775 units is entirely composed of lost shipments ('ghost inventory'): P1 (59), P3 (23), P17 (103), P19 (168), and now P24 (422), which is 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Real pipeline and on-hand inventory are both 0. Demand has shown a late-summer resurgence with P28 demand at 70 units, though the late July/early August average was lower (~21 units/period). I am using an 'explicit' L of 5 to account for the frequent shipment failures and to force the OR engine to calculate a higher base stock. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent demand volatility (avg ~31 units excluding the P28 spike, but including P28 the avg is ~39), which targets enough inventory for the current demand regime. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to reflect the high variance observed in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Period 24 order (422 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Total cumulative 'ghost' inventory is now 775 units (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24). Real physical pipeline is 0. Systemic shipment failure rate is approximately 60% of total units ordered.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 30 (2019/9/2). The demand history shows a summer peak followed by a cooldown, but importantly, the last two periods (P28-P29) show a sharp resurgence in demand (70 and 116 units respectively), likely signaling a late-summer or pre-autumn trend. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 775 is confirmed as 100% 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19, and P24). Consequently, the real physical pipeline is 0. Because the system's internal logic subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', and our 'In-transit' is purely phantom units, the backend will refuse to order unless we adjust parameters. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a high base stock that overrides this 775-unit 'In-transit' hurdle. I am targeting a base stock that covers the resumed high demand (avg ~93 over last 2 weeks) for the lead time (L=2) plus a buffer, totaling roughly 1000 units to ensure an order of ~225 is triggered despite the 775-unit ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic shipment failure: 5 major orders (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24) totaling 775 units are lost, creating a permanent 775-unit 'In-transit' inflation. Demand resurgence detected: Periods 28-29 saw demand jump from ~20 to 93 (avg), suggesting a new peak regime starting late August.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). The system shows an In-transit total of 1174 units, but significant history of shipment loss indicates that 775 of these units (from P1, P3, P17, P19, P24) are 'ghost units' that will never arrive. The only valid pipeline inventory is the Period 30 order of 399 units. On-hand remains 0, meaning we are in a physical stockout. Demand has surged significantly in the last three periods (70, 116, 127), averaging ~104 units/period, likely due to a late-summer/back-to-school or early autumn transition for the Linnea necklace. Given the high shipment failure rate (~60% by volume), the OR backend's capped policy will be heavily restricted by the 'In-transit' figure if we don't adjust parameters to account for the inflation. Setting \u03bc\u0302 to account for 3 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate (~312 units) helps, but we must use 'explicit' to force the order logic to see past the ghost inventory. Since we need to cover the current demand regime and the physical stockout, I will set mu_hat to cover the current high-demand momentum (last 3 periods average of 104 * 3 = 312) plus an adjustment for the lost physical pipeline, though the backend logic will ultimately cap the order based on safety stock logic.

Carry-over insight: New demand resurgence regime confirmed starting Period 28: 3-period average is 104.3 units (70, 116, 127), a significant increase from the July/August low of ~31 units. Total system 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments remains 775 units (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1,174 units, but significant evidence indicates that 775 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P17, P19, and P24) are lost. This leaves 399 units (ordered in Period 30) as the only potentially viable pipeline inventory. We are currently in a stockout (on-hand = 0). Demand analysis shows a new resurgence regime starting Period 28, with the last four weeks averaging 104.25 units (70, 116, 127, 104). Based on the product description (Flirty Linnea necklace) and the date (mid-September), this likely reflects a late summer/early autumn fashion peak. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover for this peak while accounting for the high shipment failure rate (~60%), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current 104 units/period mean. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P21) still follow this timing when they aren't lost completely. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high volatility (std dev ~24) of the new regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand resurgence sustained: 4-period average is 104.25 units (Periods 28-31). Systemic shipment failure rate remains extremely high; cumulative ghost inventory (lost units) is 775 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a September demand resurgence phase (Periods 28-32), with demand averaging 101.4 units over the last five periods (70, 116, 127, 104, 90). The arrival of 399 units from the Period 30 order finally resolved the stockout, leaving us with 309 units on-hand. Lead time behavior remains inconsistent (ranging from 1 to 2 periods for successful deliveries), but systemic shipment failure is a major factor. The 'In-transit' count of 775 units is confirmed as 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24) and must be ignored. To prevent over-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the current high-demand regime, while the OR controller will account for the 309 units on-hand. Since no real shipments are currently in transit, the order logic will rely on the on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: September demand resurgence regime (P28-P32) average confirmed at 101.4 units/period. Cumulative lost 'ghost' inventory remains at 775 units, representing a 100% inflation of system In-transit data as real pipeline is currently 0.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 743098002 is currently in a September/October demand resurgence regime. Over the last 6 periods (P28-P33), demand has averaged 103.7 units, showing relative stability (70, 116, 127, 104, 90, 115). The 'In-transit' figure of 775 units is confirmed as 'ghost' inventory from five failed shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24). The order from Period 30 (399 units) arrived in Period 32, leaving the current real pipeline at zero. On-hand inventory is 194 units, which is approximately enough for 1.8 periods of demand. Given the 2-period promised lead time and 1-period decision delay, we need stock to cover at least 3 periods (L+1). I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) of this high-demand regime to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to replenish before a stockout occurs, while ignoring the 775 ghost units.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand resurgence regime confirmed: 6-period average is 103.7 units (P28-P33). Real physical pipeline is 0; the 775 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (necklace) is currently in a sustained Autumn demand resurgence that began in late August (Period 28). The average demand over the last 7 periods (P28-P34) is approximately 93 units per period (70, 116, 127, 104, 90, 115, 30). Although Period 34 saw a dip to 30 units, the overall regime remains much higher than the mid-summer low (~31 units). A critical system factor is the 775 units of 'ghost' inventory in the 'In-transit' field, which are confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 17, 19, 24). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will NOT place new orders as long as it believes those 775 ghost units are coming. To force the backend to order despite this 775-unit inflation, I must set mu_hat (the basis for the base_stock) to a value that exceeds the 'In-transit' count. Current on-hand is 164. I anticipate the need to replenishment soon to avoid a stockout in 1-2 periods. I select mu_hat using 'explicit' to account for (1+L) periods of demand plus the 775 ghost units to ensure the OR logic generates a non-zero order if needed, targeting a 100 unit/period forecast.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure remains high (60%+ units) with 775 units permanently lost in 'In-transit'. To ensure the backend places orders, mu_hat must be set to account for these 775 'ghost' units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent 3-period demand (P33-35) shows a cooling trend (115, 30, 16) following the September peak. However, the September/October regime (P28-35) averaged approximately 83.5 units/period. Currently, system 'In-transit' is 1032 units, which includes 775 units of confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24). Subtracting these ghost units, real pipeline inventory is 257 units (ordered P35), and on-hand is 148 units. To ensure the OR backend generates orders despite the massive 'In-transit' inflation, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to include the 775 ghost units plus enough to cover expected demand over (L+1) periods. Total base stock target = (103.7 units/period * 3 periods) + 775 ghost units \u2248 1086. Setting mu_hat to 1086 ensures the logic 'base_stock - pipeline' doesn't result in zero or negative order recommendations. We use 'recent_N' with N=8 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen during the autumn resurgence.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure remains critical: 775 units (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24) are confirmed lost and permanently inflate 'In-transit' counts. Real physical pipeline is current In-transit minus 775.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 37 (Oct 21). Demand for the 'Flirty Linnea necklace' has stabilized at a lower level following the September resurgence; the last 3 periods (P34-36) saw demand of 30, 16, and 51 (avg 32). There is a persistent 'ghost' inventory of 775 units in the 'In-transit' count due to historical systemic shipment failures (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24). Consequently, the system reports 'In-transit: 799', but the real physical pipeline is only 24 units (ordered in P36). Current on-hand is 354, which covers over 10 periods of current demand. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 775 ghost units as available supply (which would block all new orders), I must set mu_hat explosively high (Target Stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat). Given In-transit is 799 and we want to maintain stock without over-ordering while on-hand is high, I set mu_hat to 950 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for replenishment once on-hand dips further, effectively 'absorbing' the 775 ghost units while aiming for a relative safety stock of ~175. L is set to 2 as the baseline, though actual transit varies.

Carry-over insight: Post-September cooling: demand avg dropped to ~32 units/period (P34-P36) from the previous mean of ~104. Permanent 'In-transit' inflation remains at 775 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a persistent inventory management challenge due to 775 confirmed 'ghost' units in the system-calculated 'In-transit' field (orders from P1, P3, P17, P19, and P24 that never arrived). At Period 38, the system shows 799 units In-transit. Subtracting the 775 ghost units reveals a real pipeline of 24 units (ordered P36), which are expected to arrive in Period 38 or 39. Demand has transitioned out of the high-volume September peak (avg ~104) into a lower October regime; however, P37 saw a demand of 87 units, significantly higher than the previous three weeks (30, 16, 51). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 775 ghost units as available supply and thus suppressing new orders, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' at a level that offsets these ghost units. Based on the current on-hand of 267 and the recent demand volatility, I will use an explicit mu_hat that targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the ghost units plus future demand, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-September cooling showing signs of reversal: Period 37 demand (87) is substantially higher than the Oct average (32). Ghost units remain at 775.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' is currently in a sustained demand regime following a post-September dip. Demand in the last two periods (87, 81) has significantly increased compared to the early October average (~32), suggesting a pre-holiday or early November uptick. We have a confirmed systemic issue where 775 units (from P1, P3, P17, P19, P24) are permanently lost 'ghost' units in-transit. Therefore, the current reported 'In-transit' of 800 units effectively contains only 25 real units (the P36 order of 24 and P38 order of 1). On-hand inventory is 186. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the 775-unit inflation, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I will forecast demand at approximately 84 units per period (based on the last 2 weeks). For (L+1)=3 periods, this equals 252 units. To offset the 775 ghost units that the backend subtracts from the inventory position, I will set mu_hat = 252 + 775 = 1027 units. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher historical volatility of this item.

Carry-over insight: November demand resurgence: Mean demand rebounded to ~84 units/period (P37-P38) from the Oct low of ~32. Total cumulative ghost inventory remains 775 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Flirty Linnea necklace) is entering the mid-November period. Historical data shows demand resurgence in November (Avg P37-P38: 84 units) compared to the October cooling period (Avg P34-P36: 32 units). Period 39 demand was 33, but given the volatility and the lead-up to the holiday season, I expect demand to oscillate at a higher level than the October lows. A significant challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory of 775 units (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24) which permanently inflates the system's in-transit count (currently 957). The real physical pipeline is only 182 units (957 total - 775 ghost = 182, which matches the P38/P39 combined orders of 1 + 181). On-hand inventory is 177. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the (L+1) demand PLUS the 775 ghost units. Base stock target = (demand_forecast * (L+1)) + ghost_units + safety_stock. Current 3nd-period demand average is ~67. For a 3-period window (L+1=3), forecast demand is ~200. Adding 775 ghost units requires a mu_hat around 975 to maintain flow. sigma_hat is set using recent_N to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: November demand resurgence confirmed: Mean demand ~84 units/period (P37-P38) before a P39 dip to 33. Ghost inventory remains constant at 775 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '743098002' (Thin metal chain necklace) is currently in a late-November pre-holiday phase. Historically, this product shows significant demand swings: a spring peak (~44 units), a summer surge (~112 units), and a September resurgence (~104 units). Currently, it is coming off a moderate November rebound (~84 units in P37-P38) followed by a sharp drop to 16 in P40. The systemic issue remains the 775 units of 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24) which permanently inflate the system's 'In-transit' count to 957. The internal OR logic subtracts this In-transit from the base stock. To trigger arrivals, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome these 775 'ghost' units. Current real physical inventory is 161 (on-hand) + 182 (P38-P39 orders, assuming they aren't lost) = 343 units. With demand dropping to 16, this is currently sufficient. However, I will maintain mu_hat at an 'explicit' level that accounts for the ghost units (775) plus a buffer for the expected demand (avg ~50-60 considering volatility) to ensure the system doesn't stop ordering during a potential holiday spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-82.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 743098002 is currently entering late November. Historically, the 'In-transit' count is inflated by 776 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24, and P38), which the OR backend perceives as real pipeline inventory. To ensure the backend places orders when needed, these units must be bypassed. Demand has cooled significantly in the last three weeks (33, 16, 13), averaging 20.7 units/period. On-hand inventory is 329 units, which covers ~16 periods of current demand. Since current stock is high and demand is low, I will set mu_hat to safely account for both the recent cooling and the ghost inventory. To prevent the OR backend from 'waiting' for the 776 non-existent units, mu_hat must be set to a value that reflects the demand for the lead time plus some buffer, essentially treating the ghost units as an offset. However, with 329 real units on hand and 20 units/period demand, no order is required anyway. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and 'default' for lead time to capture the current cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) increased to 776 units after Period 38 (1 unit) failed to arrive. Physical on-hand inventory of 329 is the only real stock. Late November demand cooling confirmed: 3-period average dropped to 20.7 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 743098002 is currently in a late-year demand cooling phase. The most recent three periods (P40-P42) show an average demand of 14.3 units (16, 13, 14), a significant drop from the November resurgence average of ~84 units. Current on-hand inventory is 315 units, which provides over 20 weeks of cover at the current demand rate. System 'In-transit' remains at 776 units, but carry-over history confirms these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24, and P38). Real physical pipeline is 0. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders due to this ghost pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the current cooling trend. Since the order cap logic in the backend uses pipeline inventory (776 units) vs. base_stock, and base_stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma) needs to exceed 776 to trigger a new order, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current low-demand regime will naturally result in an order of 0, which is desired given the high on-hand surplus.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 743098002 (Thin metal chain necklace) is currently in a late-year low-demand regime, with the last three periods seeing demand of 13, 14, and 10 units respectively (average 12.3). This follows a 'Black Friday' period and precedes Christmas; however, historical data from January suggests demand typically ranges between 33-53. The 'In-transit' count of 776 units is entirely composed of 'ghost' inventory from failed shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24, and P38), meaning real pipeline inventory is 0. Current on-hand inventory (305 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected lead time (2-3 periods) even if demand reverts to its Jan/Feb mean of ~35. No new orders are needed. L is set to 'calculate' based on realized lead times (1-3 periods). mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current cooling trend while the ghost inventory prevents the OR system from over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand cooling is sustained (4-period average of 13.25 units). Total cumulative ghost inventory remains 776 units (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24, P38), creating a permanent floor in system 'In-transit' data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (Dec 16, 2019), the 'Flirty Linnea necklace' is in a sustained low-demand regime following the autumn/winter cooling. The 4-period average demand is 12.25 units (13, 14, 10, 12). Current on-hand inventory is 293 units, which provides over 20 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 776 units is confirmed as 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24, P38). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly factoring in these 776 lost units as incoming supply, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Specifically, mu_hat will be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Units). With L=2, the required base stock is roughly 3 periods of demand (approx 37 units). Adding the 776 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 813. This ensures the backend calculates (813 - 776) = 37 as the available target, which is then compared against the 293 on-hand, correctly resulting in a zero order. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture current low volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), right at a holiday peak for a 'Flirty Linnea necklace'. Period 45 showed a significant demand spike (73 units), confirming a shift from the previous low-demand regime (avg ~13). Historically, the system has 776 'ghost' units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, P17, P19, P24, and P38) that are lost but still counted in the backend's pipeline calculations. To ensure the backend places an order if needed, I must adjust mu_hat to account for these ghost units. With on-hand inventory at 220 and a recent spike to 73, current stock covers ~3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent demand surge (avg ~33) while using a high 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method to bypass the 776-unit pipeline inflation and ensure availability for the remaining performance periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 45 demand surged to 73 units (+450% over the previous 4-week average). Systemic 'ghost' inventory remains at 776 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the holiday/New Year's peak for the Flirty Linnea necklace (Period 47, Dec 30). Demand surged in Period 45 (73 units) and Period 46 (70 units), which is significantly higher than the early December average (~13 units). System 'In-transit' of 933 units includes 776 confirmed 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P17, P19, P24, P38). Corrected real pipeline is roughly 157 units (the P46 order). My on-hand inventory is 150 units, which covers about 2 weeks of current peak demand. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (historically 1-2 periods for successful orders). I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current holiday regime (avg ~51 units/period) while ignoring the preceding low-demand period. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this peak.
