The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The OR algorithm recommends 59 units based on historical data. Examining the calendar, February 11th is the week leading up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14th). As a 'Flirty' necklace accessory, we should anticipate a demand spike this week and potentially sustained interest into the following week. While the OR recommendation sets a base stock level to cover demand over 3 periods (L+1), it uses a sample mean that includes a recent low (21). Given the seasonal relevance of the product for Valentine's Day and the necessity to build initial inventory from zero, the OR recommendation of 59 is a safe but slightly conservative floor. I will follow the OR recommendation of 59 to establish the initial pipeline while observing if the holiday creates a significant regime shift.",

Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (46, 33, 53, 37, 21) plus recent performance (26, 23) suggest a mean demand of approximately 34 units per period. The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', which might see steady demand but no immediate major holiday spikes are identified for late Feb/early March (post-Valentine's). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 22 units based on a capped base-stock policy. Given that we have 115 units in the pipeline and the expected demand over the lead-time window (L+1 = 3 periods) is roughly 102 units (34 * 3), the pipeline already covers the near-term risk. However, since on-hand is currently 0, we have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. The P1 order of 59 should arrive this period to satisfy P3 demand. 5.

We have had 0 sales to date due to stockouts. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (46, 33, 53, 37, 21) and observed demand in P1-P3 (26, 23, 14) suggest an average demand of approximately 31 units per week. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 0 units, likely because the pipeline (137) far exceeds the base-stock level calculated from historical demand. 5. Strategy: Even though the pipeline is high, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the P1 order is already late. If the P1 order arrives in P4, we will have 59 units to meet P4 demand. If it is lost, we continue to stock out. Given the uncertainty of the pipeline and the fact that we are currently losing $19 profit per unit of demand, I will place a small bridging order of 25 units.

Lead-time Observation: The P1 order (59 units) is significantly overdue (placed P1, promised L=2, now P5 and no arrival confirmation in P4 conclude). However, the P2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) during Period 4. This suggests the P1 order is likely lost. Demand Analysis: Historical mean demand is approx 33. Recent demand in the simulation (concluded P1-P4) has been lower (26, 23, 14, 4), averaging 16.7 units/period. The necklace is a 'Thin metal chain', which is a stable accessory but demand appears to be slowing down recently. OR Recommendation: OR recommends 0 units because the pipeline (106) + on-hand (52) far exceeds the base-stock level calculated from historical demand. Strategy: Given the likely loss of 59 units (P1), the effective pipeline is 47 (P3+P4) + 52 (on-hand) = 99 units.

My current 'In-transit' of 106 units includes the lost P1 (59) + P3 (22) + P4 (25). Removing the lost P1 units, the real pipeline is 47 units.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has fluctuated: 46, 33, 53, 37, 21, then 26, 23, 14, 4, 12. There is a clear downward trend in the last few periods (averaging ~13.8 in the game history vs ~38 in pre-game). The product is a thin metal necklace, which typically has steady baseline demand but may see early spring dips before wedding/prom seasons.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 40. True Pipeline is 47 (excluding the 59 lost units from the 106 shown). Total effective inventory = 87. \n4. **Strategy**: With a 2-period lead time, I need to cover demand for Periods 6, 7, and 8 (3 periods). Based on recent low demand (~14/week), 87 units covers roughly 6 weeks. However, using the OR's \u03bc\u0304 (approx 29/week including older samples), 87 units covers 3 weeks exactly. The OR recommends 0 because it counts the 59 lost units in its pipeline. By adjusting for the loss, I see that I have exactly enough to meet the OR's base-stock level if demand remains moderate.

Current in-transit is 106 units (from P4 order of 25, plus any missing from P3/P1 still in system). 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand was ~38. Recent demand (P4-P6) was very low (~9 avg), but Period 7 saw a massive spike to 47 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The product is a 'Flirty Linnea necklace', which may see spikes related to spring fashion or early festival season (April 1st). 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 106, but includes suspected lost orders. If we assume P1 (59) and P3 (22) are lost, the only 'real' in-transit is 25 units from P4. 4.

Lead-time / Pipeline Analysis: The promised lead-time is 2 periods. Historically, the P1 order (59 units) and P3 order (22 units) appear lost. The P4 order (25 units) is now 2 periods overdue and likely lost. The pipeline consists of 128 units, but given the high lost-shipment rate (3 out of 4 early orders), this reliability is low. OR Recommendation: The OR suggests only 3 units based on a base-stock policy that includes the 128 units in-transit. However, if those units (specifically P4 and earlier) are lost, the actual pipeline is much smaller. Strategy: We need to bridge the gap while waiting for recent orders (P8 and P9). The sudden demand increase to ~45 units/week requires immediate coverage.

Therefore, the 'real' pipeline is 146 - 106 = 40 units (the order placed in Period 10). \n4. **Requirement Calculation**: To cover the lead time + current period (L+1 = 3 periods), we need approximately 3 * 35 = 105 units.

Let's re-verify: P10 ordered 40, P11 ordered 20 (arrived P13), P12/P13 ordered 0. If in-transit is 146: P1(59) + P3(22) + P4(25) + P10(40) = 146.

The current physical 'In-transit' quantity of 809 includes these 789 lost units, meaning the actual valid pipeline is only 20 units (the P34 order was 200, but P32 and P33 arrived; the reported in-transit of 809 minus the 789 lost leaves 20 valid units from the P34 order, implying the rest of P34 might have arrived or is the only thing left). Wait, evaluating the math: P34 order was 200 units. If in-transit is 809 and confirmed lost is 789, then valid in-transit is 20 units. Total expected inventory for the next 3 weeks (L+1) is On-hand (71) + Valid In-transit (20) = 91 units.

On-hand inventory is 57 units. Recent demand has cooled significantly following the high volatility observed in P30-P38, with demands of 33, 16, and 13 units in the last three periods. The OR recommendation of 0 units reflects the high (reported) pipeline and the low recent demand. However, given the extreme unreliability of the supplier (loss rate >80%) and the fact that 50 units from P38 are already overdue, the 'valid' pipeline is only 160-210 units. With current on-hand inventory (57) and projected low demand (~15-20 units/period), the existing valid pipeline is sufficient for several periods, especially since we must avoid high holding costs if demand remains low.

However, the system reports 1019 units in-transit, while my historical tracking shows that approximately 989 of these units are permanently lost (orders P1 through P34). Therefore, the 'valid' pipeline is significantly lower. Specifically, valid units in-transit are only the orders from P38 (50 units), P40 (80 units), and P41 (80 units). The P38 order (50 units) should have arrived by P41 (L=3) or P42 (L=4); since it has not appeared in the Period 42 conclude message, it is now 2 periods overdue and highly likely lost. The current on-hand inventory is 43 units. Demand over the last two periods has stabilized at a low level (13, 14 units). To ensure availability for the next 3 periods (L+1) while accounting for the high loss rate, I need to maintain enough stock to cover roughly 15-20 units/period. On-hand (43) + Valid In-transit (P40, P41 = 160 units) is technically enough if those shipments arrive. However, given the extreme unreliability of this supplier (over 90% loss rate), I will place a small order of 30 units to hedge against the arrival failure of P40 or P41 while avoiding excessive holding costs given the low-demand regime.",

Therefore, the actual valid pipeline is currently 0. Considering the holiday demand remains high (~70 units/period) and the current on-hand (68) is barely enough for one week, I need more stock. I will override the OR recommendation of 0 because OR is likely seeing the inflated 'In-transit' number and assuming we are overstocked.
