Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 51 -> 64 -> 75 -> 99 -> 145 (last 5 weeks). This suggests growing spring seasonality for women's denim. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 2. To capture the recent accelerating trend and prevent stockouts during the lead-time window, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility, which focuses on the highest most recent observations (75, 99, 145). This results in a higher mu_hat to cover the expected demand growth.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' jeans, which is a staple item but showing a strong upward trend in February. Historical demand was: 51, 64, 75, 99, 145 (Feb 04). Period 1 actual demand was 113. There is a clear growth regime starting around late January. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. An order of 165 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit; it is expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2). Current on-hand is 0, leading to a stockout in Period 1. To capture the recent accelerating demand trend and ensure we cover the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 (covering the latest high-demand weeks: 99, 145, 113) and set L to default. This should increase the base stock calculation to account for the current growth phase.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The SKU is 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn', a women's clothing item. Demand has shown a clear upward trend in the last few weeks (75, 99, 145, 113, 124), indicating a transition from winter into early spring demand. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (165 units) and P2 (158 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition (L=2), the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message (read at P4). Currently, on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales as demand occurred (113 in P1, 124 in P2). I will set L to 'default' (2) as no deviations from the promised lead time are yet confirmed. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the higher demand levels seen since late January (avg ~121). Calculation: (1+2)*121 = 363. For sigma_hat, recent_N=5 will adjust for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-28: weekly demand increased from <75 to ~120+ units.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are experiencing a stockout with On-hand=0. The demand history shows a clear upward trend (51, 64, 75, 99, 145) followed by the last three observed periods of (113, 124, 94). The average of the last 5 samples is approximately 115. The 'Carry-over' correctly identified a regime shift around late January. I have 372 units in-transit (orders from P1: 165, P2: 158, P3: 49). Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (placed at start of P1) should have arrived during P3 and been visible at the start of P4. Since P3 conclude shows arrived=0, and we are now at P4, the P1 order is at least 1 period late or the actual lead time is 3+ periods. To ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock to cover this delay and the higher demand regime, I will set L=3 (explicitly reflecting the observed delay) and mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent high-demand level (approx 115 * (1+3) = 460).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is likely 3+ periods rather than promised 2 (P1 order not arrived by end of P3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the Period 2 order (158 units) with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by the Period 4 conclude message. However, the Period 1 order (165 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it is likely lost. Current on-hand inventory is 64 units, and demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to early January. Recent demand samples show: 99, 145, 113, 124, 94 for the last 5 periods (avg ~115). I will use N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this shift. Despite the P1 loss, the P2 arrival confirms the promised lead time of 2 can be met, so I will switch back to the 'default' lead time method (2 periods) while keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the recent higher-demand regime to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Period 1 order (165 units) confirmed lost/missing (4+ periods since order). Period 2 order arrived exactly on 2-period promised lead time, contradicting previous lead-time delay suspicions.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are faced with 0 on-hand inventory and a history of significant stockouts. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (165 units) is confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Period 2's order arrived exactly on the promised 2-period lead time. Period 3's order (49 units) was expected in Period 5 but did not arrive, and its status is now uncertain. Demand history shows a clear upward trend in Jan/Feb (peaking at 145), but recent periods (P4-P5) show a stabilization or slight cooling to 94 and 67 units respectively. However, given the product (Womens Everyday Collection Ankle-length jeans) and the current date (mid-March), we should anticipate steady spring demand. I am setting L to 'default' (2 periods) as P2 proved it is possible, but I will adopt a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=5) to capture the trend of 145, 113, 124, 94, 67. The total pipeline is 337 (P1 is lost, but effectively the system sees P3, P4 as in-transit). The backend's base-stock calculation will aim to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 3 order (49 units) is now overdue (ordered P3, expected arrival P5, currently P6 start). Monitoring for potential second lost shipment.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand history: 113, 124, 94, 94, 67, 95 (Mean ~98). The Period 1 order (165 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 3 order (49 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P3, expected P5, still missing at P7 start). If it doesn't arrive by the end of P7, it is likely lost. The Period 4 order (123 units) is expected to arrive during P6 and be visible at P7 start (Lead time 2). However, Period 6 conclude shows 0 units arrived. This means the Period 4 order is now 1 period overdue. Inventory is currently 0, and we have missed demand for 2 consecutive weeks. We have 337 units in-transit (P3: 49, P4: 123, P5: 0, P6: 165 - Wait, in-transit is 337, which likely includes the P3 order of 49 and the P4 order of 123 + others). Since shipments are consistently late or lost, I must assume a higher effective lead time for the OR engine to trigger replenishment, but use a high demand forecast to ensure the 'cap' doesn't throttle necessary recovery orders. I'll set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the current pattern of 1-period delays and maintain a recent mean of ~100/week for mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Supply chain instability confirmed. P1 order lost; P3 order 2 periods overdue; P4 order 1 period overdue. Actual lead time for successful deliveries varies between 2 and 4+ periods. Demand remains stable around 95-100 units/week despite stockouts.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a critical stockout situation (on-hand: 0) with high demand (avg ~100 units/week). Analysis of the supply chain shows significant instability: the Period 1 order is lost; Period 3, 4, and 5 orders are all overdue. Specifically, the Period 3 order (ordered P3, 49 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery date (L=2) and has not arrived. The Period 4 order (ordered P4, 123 units) is also 2 periods overdue. Only the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time. This pattern suggests that while the 'promised' lead time is 2, the actual expected delivery window for undelivered units is highly volatile and potentially stretching to 4 or 5 periods, or resulting in total loss. To compensate for the 'In-transit' figure of 425 units being unreliable due to these potential losses/delays, I am setting L to 4 to reflect the realistic time it takes to actually receive inventory. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (including the high spikes up to 133) is ~96.6 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this current regime, resulting in a base stock calculated over 5 periods (L+1). This should trigger the OR backend to place an aggressive order to cover current demand plus safety stock, accounting for the possibility that much of the 'in-transit' inventory will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability remains poor: P3, P4, and P5 orders are all significantly overdue (>2 periods past promised L=2). Effective lead time is now 4+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable. In Period 8, we finally received an order (88 units from Period 7) with a lead time of 1, but multiple large orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 8 remain in-transit and overdue. Specifically, orders from P3 (49), P4 (123), P5 (0 - though recorded as in-transit previously), and P8 (103) are missing or delayed, with P3 and P4 likely lost. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized post-seasonal spike around 100 units/week (last 4 periods mean: 94.5, 95, 133, 106 ~ approx 107). Because the backend OR engine relies on promised lead time (2) and ignores 'lost' in-transit stock when calculating base stock, I must use an explicit lead time 'L' and 'mu_hat' to force a higher order volume. I will set L=3 to account for the actual delivery delays and mu_hat based on the \ucd5c\uadfc demand regime of ~105 units/period across the lead time + review period (1+3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: P3 and P4 orders are >4 periods overdue and likely lost. Effective lead time for successful deliveries is erratic (1-2 periods), but high loss rates require higher safety targets.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable with a high loss rate. Orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are significantly overdue and likely lost (totaling 337 units of the 461 in-transit). Only orders from P7 (arrived P8) and P2 (arrived P4) have successfully delivered. Demand has stabilized post-Feb-spike to approximately 95 units per week (average of P5-P9 is 96.4). Since the in-transit inventory is cluttered with 'ghost' shipments that have not arrived and likely never will, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force the OR backend to place a meaningful order. I am setting L=2 (promised) but will account for the risk by setting mu_hat for (L+1)=3 periods based on a demand of 95 units/week (3 * 95 = 285). Because the backend subtracts the full pipeline (461) from the base stock, and 461 > 285, the OR engine would normally order 0. To counteract the lost stock, I will set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'likely lost' portion of the pipeline to trigger a replenishment. With 0 on-hand and constant stockouts, a significant order is needed.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (337 units total) are considered lost as of Period 10. Only 124 units (from P8, P9) are realistically in-transit. Demand is stable at ~95 units/week.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the supply chain remains highly unreliable. Total in-transit is 563 units, but historical evidence from Periods 1-6 indicates that 337 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6) are likely lost, as they are 5-10 weeks overdue. Only the orders from P10 (226 units) and recent deliveries from P8/P9 are reliable. Actually received lead times for the few successful deliveries have been 1-2 periods. However, to account for the high loss rate in the OR engine's base-stock calculation, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but keeping \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 elevated to ensure a significant inventory buffer. Demand is steady, averaging 98 units over the last 10 periods. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stability while the explicit L=2 prevents the base-stock from dropping too low given the recent large order in P10.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery noted in P10: P8 and P9 orders arrived (L=2 and L=1 respectively), confirming that while early orders (P1, P3-P6) are lost, the system is currently delivering within the promised lead time window.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system is at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 11 (sold 48 units vs 74 demand). History confirms that orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are lost. However, logic from Periods 8, 9, and 10 showed that orders placed in Period 7 (L=1), Period 8 (L=2), and Period 9 (L=1) arrived successfully, indicating the delivery pipeline has stabilized recently even if previous orders remain missing. The 563 units in-transit includes a massive 226-unit order from Period 10 (expected this period, P12) and the 'lost' units. Demand has stabilized post-regime shift; the last 5 samples are [133, 106, 81, 76, 74], averaging ~94. To account for the high loss rate observed earlier and ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout, I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 300 (roughly 100 per week for L+1=3 weeks), and sigma_hat explicitly slightly higher (40) to maintain a higher safety stock given the history of lost shipments, even though the latest arrivals were on time.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed\u2014historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6) are lost, but recent orders (P7, P8, P9) arrived with L=1 or 2. Demand has settled to ~90-100 units/week after the early February spike.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the supply chain remains bifurcated. Orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (totaling 337 units) are effectively lost. Recent orders from Periods 7, 8, and 9 arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods, suggesting currently active shipments follow the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the in-transit balance of 563 units includes the 337 lost units plus the Period 10 order (226 units), which should arrive this period (P13) if the 3-period maximum lead time holds (ordered P10, L=2 means arrival P12, observed P13). Demand has stabilized around 85-95 units per week after the early seasonality. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this settled demand (averaging ~79 per week, though impacted by stockouts). To account for the 337 lost units in 'pipeline inventory' and ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the next (L+1) periods, I will set L to 2 (promised) and use mu_hat to ensure we remain stocked through the lead time, specifically focusing on the recent demand stability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 399256032 is currently experiencing a total stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant backload of in-transit units (563). Analysis of the history shows that shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (337 units) are effectively lost or permanently delayed, as they are now 7-12 weeks past their order dates. Recent shipments (Periods 7, 8, 9) arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods, confirming the system is currently functional for new orders. The 563 units in-transit includes the 337 lost units and the 226 units ordered in Period 10. Given the promised lead time is 2, the P10 order should have arrived in Period 12 or 13. Since it is now Period 14 start and 'Period 13 conclude' shows no arrivals, the P10 order is at least 1 period overdue. Demand has stabilized around 80-95 units per week after the early February spike. I am setting L to explicit value 3 to reflect the current observed delay of the P10 order. I will use the last 10 samples (excluding the initial spike) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which should provide a robust baseline for the current demand regime of ~85-90 units/week while accounting for the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 10 order (226 units) is now 1 period overdue (ordered P10, expected P12/13). Total confirmed/likely lost units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6) remain at 337 units. Current effective lead time is 3+ periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019-05-20), the SKU continues to face severe supply chain reliability issues. The 'In-transit' count of 563 units reflects a massive accumulation of undelivered orders: P1 (165), P3 (49), P4 (123), P10 (226), along with minor leftovers. Based on history, orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (337 total) are definitively lost. The order from Period 10 (226 units), placed 5 periods ago, is also significantly overdue (promised L=2) and should be treated as likely lost given the lack of arrival message in Period 14's conclusion. Consequently, effective 'Pipeline' is near zero despite the 563 units shown. Demand has softened recently from its ~100/week peak to approximately 65-75 units/week in the last 4 observed periods (P11-P14). I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will explicitly set mu_hat to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand based on the recent lower average (approx 70 units/week), resulting in a mu_hat of 210. I set sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to maintain a protective safety stock given the high loss rate. This will force the OR engine to place a new order to replenish the zero on-hand inventory, as it will ignore the 563 stale in-transit units through the cap/policy logic when mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned to current needs.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Period 10 order (226 units) is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost; total probable lost units now equal 563 (P1, P3, P4, P10). Recent demand (P11-P14) has declined to approx 70 units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system faces zero on-hand inventory and a distorted in-transit value of 563 units. Analysis of history confirms that orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and likely others are lost, as they are significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time. The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit) to subtract from the base stock; since the system thinks 563 units are coming, it will order nothing unless I adjust parameters. Demand has shifted from a peak of ~145 units in early February to a lower, stable regime of ~65 units/week over the last 4 periods (P12-P15). Given the massive 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that is high enough to trigger a new order, effectively treating the 563 units as non-existent. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the current 65/week rate plus safety stock, and to offset the 563 'phantom' units, I set mu_hat to 800. This ensures the calculation (800 - 563) results in a meaningful order to restart supply.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed demand regime shift to lower volume (~65 units/week) observed from P12-P15. Total lost inventory (phantom in-transit) confirmed at 563 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 orders).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are managing a situation where the product (Skinny Ankle Jeans) has stabilized into a lower demand regime, averaging ~67.5 units/week over the last 4 periods (P13-P16: 66, 58, 65, 80). The significant issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 816 units, which includes 563 units from historical orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10) that are highly likely lost given they are 7+ periods overdue. Only the 253 units ordered in Period 16 are realistically in-transit. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (816) from the base stock, it would normally order 0. To force an order and maintain stock for the upcoming weeks despite the phantom inventory, I am setting an explicit L=6. This increases the base stock calculation (treating expected lead time as longer to account for losses) and increases mu_hat significantly to override the 816-unit pipeline deduction. I've set mu_hat explicitly to 500 (approx 71 units/period * 7) to ensure the system targets a total inventory level high enough to cover current demand while ignoring the lost units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent arrival of 253 units (ordered in Period 16) with a lead time of 1 period confirms that the supply chain is delivering again, although historical 'phantom' in-transit inventory (563 units from P1, P3, P4, P10) is definitively lost. I will treat the 'In-transit' as 0 in my mental model, but since the OR engine sees 563 units, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat that are high enough to bypass the 'pipeline-inventory' deduction (final order = base_stock - pipeline). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~65-70 units/week over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). To maintain service levels against a 2-period promised lead time (3 periods of coverage needed), and to trigger an order despite the phantom 563 units in-transit, I set an explicit mu_hat that accounts for this phantom inventory plus the desired stock level (approx 210 units). This forces the engine to place an order if on-hand drops too low. For Period 18, on-hand is 188, which covers nearly 3 periods of demand, so a minimal or zero order is likely desired, but mu_hat must be set to prevent the phantom inventory from suppressing future necessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Successful arrival of P16 order (L=1, 253 units) confirms lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods, although phantom inventory remains a factor in pipeline calculations. Demand regime is stable at ~65-70 units/week.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17. Demand analysis shows a sustained regime shift starting around Period 12, with demand stabilizing at a lower average of approximately 65-70 units/week compared to early periods. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 12-18) to reflect this lower demand environment accurately. Lead time for recent successful deliveries (P16, P8, P9, P7) has been 1-2 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate these actual observations. Most importantly, the In-transit figure of 599 units includes significant 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P10) that are highly likely lost and will never arrive. The backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory (In-transit) from the target base stock. To prevent these lost units from suppressing new orders and causing persistent stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' value for mu_hat. This value (1750) is calculated as: [Target Base Stock for 3 periods (~210) + Total Lost Units (~566)]. This overrides the pipeline calculation effectively, ensuring the backend places orders that cover actual demand and safety stock despite the phantom 'in-transit' volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Phantom inventory (lost orders) confirmed at ~563-566 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10). Recent demand regime (P12-P18) remains stable at ~66 units/week, significantly lower than Q1 2019 levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (2019/6/24), the inventory status shows 140 units on-hand and 1166 units in-transit. A critical analysis of the 'in-transit' volume reveals that approximately 566 units are 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10). Subtracting these lost units leaves a real pipeline of 600 units, which is the order placed in Period 19. The demand regime has sustained a significant drop: the average demand from Period 13 to Period 19 is approx 51 units/week, a sharp decline from earlier periods (80-100 units). The most recent demand was only 33 units. Lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized at 1-2 periods. Given the large real pipeline of 600 units (which represents ~12 weeks of demand at the new regime) and 140 units on-hand, we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the lower demand regime (avg ~51) and L to default (2). No new order will be triggered by the OR engine because the pipeline exceeds any reasonable base stock for this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand has decreased from ~100 to ~51 units/week since Period 13 (approx 50% drop). Phantom inventory persists at 566 units.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21 (2019/7/1). Demand has significantly declined, averaging ~44 units/week over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) compared to ~100+ earlier in the year. The Women's Everyday Ankle Jeans likely saw a spring peak followed by a summer slowdown. As of P21, on-hand inventory is 112 units. The in-transit pipeline of 1166 contains a massive 'phantom' component: 566 units are considered lost (orders P1, P3-P6, P10). Subtracting these leaves 600 units (the P19 order) as 'true' in-transit, which is extremely high given current demand. I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P16, P18) have been fast (L=1). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=8 to capture the lower demand regime (~63 units/week), resulting in a base stock target that accounts for the current slowdown. No new orders are expected or needed due to the large P19 shipment currently in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower volume: average demand for P16-P20 is ~44 units/week, down from ~95 earlier. Summer seasonality for this SKU (Skinny Ankle Jeans) appears to be significantly lower than spring.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' has entered a significant low-demand summer regime. Starting around Period 18, demand notably dropped from the previous mid-range (~60s) to a recent range of 20-33 units/week. The current on-hand inventory (92) and real in-transit inventory (the large P19 order of 603 units) are vastly disproportionate to this current demand level. There are approximately 566 units of 'phantom' inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10) that the OR backend will incorrectly see as available pipeline, but even accounting for that, the P19 order of 603 units ensures we will be overstocked for many periods. Given demand for the last three weeks (33, 28, 20), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward trend (averaging ~27 units/week) and sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility at lower volume. Lead time is set to default (promised 2) as recent deliveries have been arriving within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Summer demand trough confirmed. Average demand for P19-P21 has dropped to ~27 units/week, a further ~40% decrease from the previous low-volume regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Historical demand for SKU 399256032 (Skinny Ankle Jeans) shows a clear seasonal decline typical of heavy denim categories in mid-summer. Recent demand (P19-P22) has dropped to an average of ~28.5 units/week, down from ~95 units earlier in the year. Although on-hand inventory is 59 units, which covers about 2 periods of current demand, there is a massive 'In-transit' balance of 1166 units. Based on history, at least 566 units are confirmed 'phantom' or lost (orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10). However, a large order of 603 units was placed in Period 19. If that order arrives within the promised lead time (L=2) or even slightly delayed, it will satisfy all demand for the foreseeable future. Given the low demand regime and the impending arrival of the P19 order, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the summer trough, and use the promised lead time (L=2) to allow the OR backend to reconcile current inventory and the large incoming shipment.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough for Skinny Ankle Jeans persists: P19-P22 average demand is ~28.5 units/week, a significant decline from the spring average of ~95. The P19 order of 603 units is currently in the delivery window (L=2+), and its arrival will create a significant surplus given current demand trends.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' has reached a summer trough, with the last 5 periods (P19-P23) averaging 34.4 units, significantly down from the spring peak of ~100. There is a huge 'In-transit' balance of 1166 units, which is a mix of likely lost shipments ('phantom inventory') and a massive recent order from Period 19 (603 units). The phantom inventory accounts for 566 units (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10). The P19 order is now reaching its potential arrival window (L=2+). Given the current demand of ~35 units/week and the imminent arrival of 603 units, we are facing an extreme overstock risk. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the low summer demand regime. Since lead times for successful deliveries have varied between 1 and 2 periods recently, I will use recent_N (N=3) for L. The OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent ordering more units while we wait for the P19 order to resolve.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand trough confirmed (Period 19-23): average demand dropped to ~34 units/week from previous levels. Significant overstock risk exists due to the P19 order (603 units) entering the delivery window.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019, which is mid-summer for Skinny Ankle Jeans. Demand has significantly decelerated from the spring peak (~95 units/week) to a summer trough (Period 19-24 average is ~31 units/week). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The massive Period 19 order (603 units) is now 5 periods old and remains in-transit. While many historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10 totaling 566 units) are confirmed lost, the P19 order is the most significant concern. If P19 is not lost, it will create a massive surplus (approx. 19 weeks of supply at current demand). If it is lost, our pipeline is actually much lower. Given the high loss rate in previous months, I am setting parameters based on the current lower demand regime (last 5 periods) but keeping a conservative safety buffer. The mu_hat is set to reflect the current low demand (~31/week) over the (L+1) horizon. We will continue to avoid new ordering until the situation of the P19 order (part of the 1166 in-transit) is clarified to prevent extreme overstocking in a low-demand season.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Period 19 order (603 units) is now 5 periods old and potentially lost, similar to the P10 order. If lost, total phantom inventory increases to 1169 units. Summer demand regime remains stable at ~30-35 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/5. The SKU (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is in a summer demand trough with the last 7 periods (P19-P25) averaging ~31 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The major issue is the 'Phantom Inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 1166 units, which consists of lost orders from P1, P3-P6 (337 units), P10 (226 units), and now highly likely the P19 order (603 units), which is 6 periods old (ordered P19, expected P21). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, the 1166 units of in-transit will prevent any new orders from being placed. However, because these units are physically lost, we must adjust the OR parameters to force an order. I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the current safety stock requirement. With mu_hat set to 1350 and sigma_hat at 100, the base stock (approx 1450) will exceed the 1166 phantom units, prompting the backend to order approximately 280 units to restore physical availability for the low-volume summer period.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: P19 order (603 units) confirmed lost (6 periods since order, promised L=2). Total phantom inventory (lost units) now stands at 1169 units (P1, P3-P6, P10, P19). Demand remains in summer trough at ~30 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' is in a summer demand trough, with recent weekly demand (P21-P26) averaging approximately 28 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units (1435) are dominated by 'phantom inventory' (orders likely lost in transit). Specifically, orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, and 19 (totaling 1169 units) are significantly past their delivery window and considered lost. The only reliable in-transit order is the one from Period 26 (269 units). Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (total in-transit) to calculate orders, the 1169 phantom units will prevent it from placing new orders unless compensated. To ensure the backend actually orders units to meet demand, I will use 'explicit' methods to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. \u03bc\u0302 is set based on the current demand regime (~30 units/week) multiplied by (1+L), and then significantly inflated to offset the 1169 phantom units (Base stock = mu_hat + safety). I am targeting a base stock that ignores the phantom inventory, essentially requiring an effective target of approximately 100 units (3 weeks of demand) + 1169 phantom offset = 1269. However, the OR backend also applies a cap. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1350, I signal a high base stock requirement to overcome the pipeline bloat caused by losses.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime is consistently low, averaging 28-34 units/week (P19-26). Phantom inventory (lost orders) has reached 1169 units following the confirmed loss of the P19 (603 units) shipment. Successful recent shipments (P16, P18) had a lead time of 1, but systemic reliability remains low.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a summer demand trough for SKU 399256032 (Skinny Ankle Jeans). Demand has settled into a low-volume regime, averaging approximately 30 units per week over the last 9 periods (P19-P27). The OR backend is currently misled by a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1435 units. Analysis of history confirms that 1169 of these units are lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10, and now P19). The only realistically active in-transit inventory is the 269 units ordered in P26. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is ~30 units/week, we need to ensure local availability for the 2-period lead time. However, the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will subtract the full 1435 units from its target, preventing any new orders. To fix this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that overrides the phantom inventory. I calculate the target base stock as: (L+1) * Mean_Demand + Safety_Stock. Given demand ~30, L=2, target stock should be roughly (3 * 30) + 1.5 * (std_dev). Based on recent volatility, I'll set mu_hat to 130 to force the backend to account for the actual pipeline (269 units) and local demand needs, effectively neutralizing the calculation error caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory inaccuracy: 1169 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P1, P3-P6, P10, P19) and will never arrive. The OR backend significantly underestimates required orders because it sees these 'phantom' units as incoming supply.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), we are dealing with a severe inventory discrepancy. The 'In-transit' count of 1435 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3-P6, P10, P19), totaling approximately 1169 units. The OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock, preventing it from placing necessary orders. To force the backend to order despite this phantom inventory, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Current demand averages ~32 units/week (P24-P28). With an expected lead time L=2, a standard base stock would be ~96 units (3 weeks * 32). However, to overcome the 1169-unit phantom pipeline, the backend needs a base_stock parameter significantly higher than the phantom total. I will set mu_hat to 1400. This is calculated to force an order: Target (1400) - Pipeline (1435) is still negative, but the OR engine's 'cap' logic (mu/(1+L) + safety buffer) will allow a replenishment order to trigger based on the high mu_hat. This 'explicit' override is the only way to bypass the 'pipeline' subtraction when shipments are lost but not cleared from the system.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Systemic failure confirmed. Phantom inventory (lost orders) has reached ~1169 units, causing the OR backend to cease ordering. 'Explicit' mu_hat overrides (value > phantom inventory) are required to force replenishment.

A massive systemic issue exists: 'In-transit' inventory shows 1435 units, but 1169 of these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3-6, 10, and 19. Furthermore, the Period 26 order (269 units) is now 4 periods old (promised lead time 2) and is also suspected to be lost. The OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' pipeline from its base stock calculation, resulting in zero orders and persistent stockouts despite on-hand inventory being 0. To force replenishment for the observed demand regime (~30 units/week), I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a target that exceeds the total in-transit count. Given L=2, the backend base stock formula is roughly mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat to 1600, I ensure the backend targets a base stock higher than the 1435 units it thinks are coming, triggering approximately 150-200 units of new orders to cover anticipated demand and safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory inaccuracy: Out of 1435 units 'In-transit', at least 1169 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3-P6, P10, P19). The Period 26 order (269 units) is now 4 periods old and also highly likely lost. Effective on-hand and reliable pipeline is 0 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to present significant reliability issues, with a large 'phantom' inventory accumulating in the 'In-transit' pipeline. As of Period 31, the In-transit total is 1618 units. However, historical analysis confirms that the following orders are highly likely lost: P1 (165), P3 (49), P4 (123), P5 (0 - N/A), P6 (0 - N/A), P10 (226), P19 (603), and P26 (269). These stalled orders total 1435 likely lost units. Only the Period 30 order (183 units) is realistically in-transit within a normal delivery window. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1618 units from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is set to exceed this phantom inventory. Current demand is in a summer trough averaging ~30 units/week (P25-P30). To force a replenishment of approximately 90-100 units (covering 3 periods of demand), I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that overcomes the 1618 phantom units plus the desired order size. Setting mu_hat to 1750 (1618 + ~130) will signal the backend to place an order despite the massive (but non-existent) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Systemic inventory inaccuracy persists. Confirmed lost 'phantom' units total 1435 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P26). The OR backend remains paralyzed without explicit mu_hat overrides exceeding the phantom total.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently facing a systemic issue where the OR backend inventory tracker is inflated by 'phantom' in-transit units from orders that are confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 19, and likely 26). The total 'lost' inventory is approximately 1,704 units (165 + 49 + 123 + 0 + 0 + 226 + 603 + 269), which exceeds the current in-transit display of 1,768 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (1,768) from the calculated base stock, it will not place any orders unless mu_hat is set explicitly to a value higher than the phantom inventory. Current demand is in a summer trough averaging ~30-35 units/week. To force a replenishment order that covers expected demand (approx. 33 units/week) for the next 3 weeks (L+1) while overcoming the 1,768 phantom units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1,900 (calculated as roughly 1,768 + 100 safety barrier + 32 expected demand). This ensures the ordering logic sees a 'gap' and places an order despite the incorrect pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory inaccuracy reached critical levels in Period 32: In-transit count (1,768) is almost entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P26, P30). Explicit mu_hat must remain >1,800 to bypass the backend's pipeline subtraction until these units are manually or automatically cleared from the system.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-183.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we finally saw a delivery of the orders placed in Periods 30 and 31 (333 units total), which has replenished on-hand inventory to 303 units. This confirms that the current supply chain is functioning with a lead time of 1-2 periods, even as older 'phantom' orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P26) totaling 1,435 units remain stuck in the 'In-transit' pipeline. Current demand is stable in a low-volume regime of ~30 units/week (6-week average). With 303 units on hand, we have approximately 10 weeks of stock, which is an oversupply given the holding costs. However, our primary challenge remains the OR backend's calculation: if we allow the backend to use its default logic, it will subtract the 1,580 'In-transit' units from its target and place zero orders until we stock out again. To maintain a state where we can order if needed, but not force unnecessary stock in this oversupplied state, I will set mu_hat to 1,800. This value is slightly above the total phantom inventory (1,580) + one period of demand, ensuring the system doesn't 'paralyze' while preventing massive over-ordering now that we have sufficient physical stock for the immediate term.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Delivery of P30 and P31 orders confirms recent lead time stability (L=1-2). On-hand inventory (303) now exceeds 10 weeks of current demand (~30/wk). Phantom inventory remains at 1,580 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (2019/9/30), on-hand inventory is 265 units, which provides approximately 8-10 weeks of coverage based on the stabilized summer/early autumn demand of ~30 units/week. Real pipeline inventory has improved with the arrival of orders from P30 and P31 (totaling 333 units), confirming current lead times are stable at 1-2 periods. However, the system still tracks 1,580 units in 'In-transit', most of which are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10, P19, P26). Because the OR backend subtracts these phantom units from the 'base_stock' target, it will not place new orders unless 'mu_hat' is set explicitly high. Given the current surplus (265 on-hand vs. ~30 demand), I will set mu_hat to 0 to prevent further ordering and allow on-hand inventory to deplete toward more efficient levels, which also bypasses the phantom inventory issue for now. I am setting L and sigma_hat to recent averages to match the current stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Strategic inventory depletion initiated. Current on-hand (265) provides ~8 periods of coverage at current demand (~33/week). Explicitly suppressing orders to reduce holding costs while phantom inventory persists.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stable low-demand regime (~33 units/week) following the summer trough. The system has 229 units on-hand, which provides approximately 7 periods of coverage. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1,580 units is almost entirely 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10, P19, and P26). Because the OR backend subtracts this in-transit total from the target base stock, it will not place new orders unless specifically forced. I am continuing the strategic inventory depletion initiated in P34 to reduce holding costs. By setting mu_hat to 0, I ensure no new orders are placed while we utilize the current surplus. We will re-evaluate replenishment when on-hand inventory falls below 100 units (approx. 3 weeks of safety stock + lead time coverage).

Carry-over insight: Strategic depletion phase: On-hand inventory (229) is being used to clear surplus while phantom in-transit (1,580) prevents automated ordering.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36, the system has 345 units on-hand. Current demand is stable in a low-volume regime (averaging ~33 units/week over the last 5 periods). With current stock levels, we have approximately 10 weeks of inventory coverage, which significantly exceeds the promised lead time of 2 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,435 is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3-P6, P10, P19, P26), which prevents the OR backend from ordering under default settings. However, given the overstock situation (holding cost is $1.0 vs potential lost sales margin of $4.0), we should continue the strategic depletion phase to minimize holding costs. No new orders are needed; by using 'default' (or very low values), the backend will see the massive phantom pipeline and correctly place an order of 0 units. I will prioritize clearing the existing on-hand surplus.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Strategic depletion continues. On-hand inventory (345) provides ~10 weeks of coverage at the current demand regime (~33 units/week). Phantom inventory remains at 1,435 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37, the SKU 'Skinny Ankle R.W Brooklyn' remains in a summer-fall demand trough, with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 25-30 units (Period 36 shows only 13 units). My previous strategic ordering has successfully countered the 'phantom inventory' (now confirmed at 1,435 units consisting of lost orders P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10, and P19) to restore on-hand availability. Current on-hand inventory is 332 units, which provides over 11 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate (~29 units/week average over the last 5 periods). Since the target service level is set by the profit/holding ratio ($4/$1), and the cost of holding excess stock for a low-demand period is significant, I will continue the strategic depletion phase. No new orders are required until on-hand levels drop significantly or a seasonal demand spike is anticipated. To ensure the OR backend does not place unintended orders despite the massive phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent small samples, effectively keeping the base stock below the pipeline threshold.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Strategic depletion phase continues; on-hand inventory (332) provides ~11 weeks coverage at current demand regime (~30 units/week). Phantom inventory remains stagnant at 1,435 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a sustained low-demand regime, with demand over the last five periods (P33-P37) averaging approximately 25.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is 319 units, which provides approximately 12 periods of coverage at current demand levels. There is a significant systemic reporting issue: 1,435 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost shipments (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, and 26). The OR backend automatically subtracts this 'phantom' inventory from its calculated base stock, which would normally prevent any new orders. However, since we currently have a large on-hand surplus and a high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $4.0), the strategic goal remains inventory depletion to minimize carrying costs. I will continue to suppress new ordering by setting parameters that result in a base stock lower than the on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Current on-hand inventory (319) provides ~12 weeks of coverage for the stabilized low-demand regime (~26 units/week). Strategic depletion persists to mitigate holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a strategic depletion phase. On-hand inventory is 303 units, while the demand regime has further softened to approximately 14-16 units per week over the last two periods (P37 and P38). At the current demand rate, the existing stock provides over 15 weeks of coverage (303 / ~20 \u2248 15+ periods). Simultaneously, the system is burdened by 1,435 units of 'phantom' In-transit inventory, which are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3-P6, P10, P19, P26) that the OR backend incorrectly views as incoming supply. To prevent the OR backend from ordering more units while we carry significant surplus and to minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period), I am setting mu_hat to 0. This forces the backend to place zero orders until the on-hand inventory is naturally depleted toward a safer, lower level or the phantom inventory is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted Period 37-38: demand has further declined to ~15 units/week. Strategic depletion continues with ~15+ periods of on-hand coverage.

Demand has settled into a very low regime (approx. 15 units/week) observed over the last three periods (P37-P39), likely reflecting late-autumn/winter seasonality for skinny ankle jeans. On-hand inventory is 288 units, which provides nearly 19 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1435 is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10, P19, and P26) which are confirmed lost. However, given the massive on-hand surplus relative to demand, no new orders are necessary. I will maintain a zero-order strategy by setting L to default and using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to reflect the most recent demand drop, which will result in a base stock level far below the current on-hand + in-transit sum, effectively preventing the OR backend from ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Mean demand further decreased to ~15 units/week (P37-P39), down from the summer average of ~30. This suggests a winter trough for this SKU.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a deep demand trough, likely due to winter seasonality. Demand has dropped from a summer average of ~30/week to a very low ~15/week over the last 4 periods (P37-40). Current on-hand inventory is 277 units, which provides approximately 18 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1435 is heavily inflated by 1169 units confirmed lost from early periods (P1, P3-P6, P10, P19) and 269 units from P26 which are also likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts this massive phantom pipeline from its order calculation, it will not place orders unless the 'base_stock' exceeds 1435. Since we have a massive surplus relative to actual demand (277 on-hand vs. 15/week demand), the strategic objective remains 'Depletion' to minimize holding costs. I will keep mu_hat at its default level; the system will naturally order zero units because (on-hand + phantom in-transit) is far higher than the calculated base stock. This is desired as we do not need more inventory.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: Mean demand since Period 37 has decreased to ~15 units/week (approx 50% drop from summer levels). Inventory remains in a long-term depletion phase.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a confirmed winter demand trough. Mean demand has dropped significantly to approximately 10-15 units per week over the last five periods (P37-P41), down from the summer average of 30. Current on-hand inventory is 273 units, which provides over 20 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,435 units is comprised entirely of confirmed lost shipments (phantom inventory) from earlier periods (P1, P3, P10, P19, P26). Because the backend subtracts in-transit units from its target stock, and our on-hand inventory is already excessively high for the current demand regime, I will continue the strategic depletion phase. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand decline while keeping them low to prevent the OR backend from attempting any new orders, thereby reducing holding costs and utilizing the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: Mean demand has stabilized at ~10-15 units/week since Period 37, representing a ~50% drop from summer levels (~30 units/week).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' is currently in a winter demand trough, with demand averaging approximately 10-15 units per week since Period 37. As of the start of Period 43, the on-hand inventory is 264 units. At the current demand rate, this provides over 17 weeks of coverage, which is more than enough to last through the end of the simulation (Period 47). The system still shows 1435 units 'In-transit', which are confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3-6, 10, 19, and 26). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' in-transit inventory from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless the target exceeds 1435. Given the massive surplus and the approaching end of the game, I will continue the strategic depletion strategy by using 'default' parameters. This will result in a calculated base stock far below the phantom inventory level, ensuring no new orders are placed and minimizing further holding costs while selling off existing stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for Skinny Ankle Jeans is in a winter trough, averaging ~11 units/week over the last 5 periods (P39-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 255 units, providing approximately 23 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate. The In-transit figure of 1,435 is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P5, P6, P10, P19, P26), creating a systemic error in the backend's stock calculation. To maximize profit R_t and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period), no new orders should be placed. I will continue the 'explicit' parameter strategy to prevent the OR backend from ordering, however, since on-hand is already excessive, I set mu_hat to 0 to ensure the order quantity remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: Mean demand has further stabilized at ~11 units/week (P39-P43), a significant drop from the summer regime (~30) and the spring peak (~95).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Skinny Ankle Jeans' has reached a winter trough, with an average of approximately 9 units/week over the last five periods (P40-P44). Current on-hand inventory is 247 units, which provides over 27 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. We are in a strategic depletion phase intended to minimize holding costs, given the excessive on-hand stock relative to demand. Furthermore, 'In-transit' inventory remains inflated by 1,435 phantom units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P26). Since the OR backend subtracts this phantom pipeline from its target, no orders will be triggered unless mu_hat is set to a value significantly exceeding the phantom total. Given the current surplus, no replenishment is needed. We maintain L=default and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, which will keep calculated targets low and ensure no further units are ordered.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'winter trough' with very low demand, averaging ~10 units/week over the last 9 periods (P37-P45). On-hand inventory is 236 units, which at the current demand rate provides approximately 23 weeks of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,435 is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P26) that have not arrived despite the promised 2-period lead time passing by months. Because the backend subtracts this 'phantom' pipeline from the base stock calculation, it will not place orders unless the target exceeds ~1,450. However, since on-hand inventory is currently excessive given the low demand, no orders are desired. We will continue the strategic depletion phase by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=9, covering the stable winter regime) and keeping L at 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough persists: demand since Period 37 has remained stable at an average of ~10 units/week, a significant decline from summer (~30) and spring (~95) peaks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399256032' (Women's Skinny Ankle Jeans) is currently in a deep winter demand trough. Since Period 36, weekly demand has averaged approximately 9.3 units, significantly lower than the summer average (~30) and the spring peak (~95). We are currently in a strategic depletion phase because on-hand inventory (233 units) is massive relative to current demand, providing roughly 25 weeks of coverage at the current rate (233 / 9.3 \u2248 25). Additionally, the system reports 1435 units in-transit, which are almost entirely 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments in early and mid-2019 (Periods 1, 3-6, 10, 19, and 26). Because the backend policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302), these 1435 phantom units would normally prevent any automatic ordering. To continue the depletion of the current surplus and avoid incurring excessive holding costs ($1/unit/period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime while allowing the on-hand stock to naturally decline. No new orders are needed; the on-hand stock will easily satisfy demand for the foreseeable future.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand trough confirmed: Average weekly demand from Period 36 to Period 46 is ~9.3 units. Strategic depletion of the 233 units of on-hand inventory is required to mitigate holding costs.
