Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 507909003. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 86.2 units/week (79, 74, 103, 79, 96). There is no on-hand inventory or units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The product is a women's tailored shirt, which is a stable staple but might see a slight increase as late February/early March approaches due to new season shopping. Based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the backend OR logic will target a high service level (q \u2248 0.95). I will use the recent 5 samples to establish a baseline forecast. Since L=2, mu_hat represents (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. 3 * 86.2 = 258.6.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 107 units, but demand was 111, resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3 resolution and becomes visible in P4 decision phase. Demand history (Jan-Feb) shows values: 79, 74, 103, 79, 96, and 111 (P1). The mean across these 6 samples is approximately 90.3. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the lead time is 2, the pipeline needs to cover Period 2, Period 3, and Period 4 demand (L+1 = 3 periods). Using N=5 for recent demand to capture the slight upward trend (96, 111) while maintaining stability. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock to cover the exposure period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/2/25. History shows a significant demand spike: Period 1 demand was 111 and Period 2 was 159, both exceeding pre-game historical samples (avg ~86). As this is a women's tailored shirt, the sharp increase in February suggests a seasonal transition to spring wear or professional attire demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, while 226 units are in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2, the Period 1 order (107 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 3 and be visible in Period 4. The Period 2 order (119 units) is expected in Period 4. Given the clear upward trend (111 -> 159), I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the elevated demand regime for my base stock calculations (mu_hat and sigma_hat). Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as we haven't yet observed the first arrival to verify or adjust timing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-02-11: Average demand increased from ~86 to 135 (+57%) over the last two periods, likely due to spring seasonality for blouses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand samples (79, 74, 103, 79, 96) and recent performance in Periods 1-3 (111, 159, 126) show a clear upward shift in demand, likely due to spring seasonality for blouses. The mean demand for the last 3 periods is ~132. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible now, but 'arrived=0' is reported for P3. This suggests either a delay or that the 2-period lead time means arrival in P4. With 417 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3: 107+119+191=417) and 0 on-hand, we are currently stock-out. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the higher demand regime [111, 159, 126], resulting in (1+2)*132 = 396. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Mean demand across Periods 1-3 is 132 (+53% vs initial samples). Potential lead time delay or strict adherence to L=2 arriving in the following period's conclusion report.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. The product is a women's blouse (spring/transition item). Historical demand in Feb-Mar shows a shift: Initial samples averaged ~86, but Period 1-4 demand values are [111, 159, 126, 91], averaging 121.75. Period 4 demand (91) was lower, but the overall trend since mid-February is higher than Jan. Lead time: Period 4 conclude shows an arrival from P2 with L=2, confirming the promised lead time holds. Period 1 order (107 units) is missing from the 'conclude' logs (should have arrived in P3 conclude); it is likely lost or significantly delayed, leaving the on-hand inventory (28) precarious. Total pipeline is 347, which covers future demand, but we must ensure mu_hat reflects the higher regime (approx 122/week). I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand level after the shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (107 units) appears lost or significantly delayed (exceeded promised L=2 with no arrival pulse in P3/P4). Forecast remains elevated compared to Jan baseline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019-03-18), we face a stockout (on-hand: 0). Re-evaluating the history: The order from Period 1 (107 units) never arrived, confirming it is lost. The arrival in Period 4 was from Period 2 (L=2). The order from Period 3 (191 units) was placed on Feb 25th; with a promised L=2, it should have arrived during Period 5 and be visible in this Period 6 'conclude' message. Since Period 5 conclude shows 'arrived=0', the P3 order is now overdue. Total in-transit (419) includes P1(107-lost), P3(191-overdue), P4(49), and P5(72). Effective pipeline inventory is lower than 419. Demand since Feb 11 (Period 1-5) has averaged 115.8 units/period, which is higher than the Jan baseline (~86) but has stabilized from the initial spike. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and explicit lead time (L=3) to account for the current delivery delays, signaling the OR backend to place larger safety orders to combat the loss and uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed loss of Period 1 shipment (107 units). Period 3 shipment (191 units) is overdue (L>2). Current delivery reliability is low, necessitating an increase in lead time parameter for safety stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 analysis: Current date is 2019-03-25. We are seeing a sustained demand shift for this blouse, with realized demand in the last 6 periods averaging ~117 units/week compared to the pre-February average of ~86. The SKU is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand. Lead-time reliability is highly volatile: P1's order (107 units) is confirmed lost; P2 arrived in 2 periods; P3 (191 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P3, current P7 start, should have arrived in P5 or P6); P5 arrived in only 1 period. To protect against the stock-out and highly unreliable supply (lost and overdue orders), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to increase safety stock. mu_hat will use the last 6 samples (N=6) to capture the higher post-January regime (mean ~117.7 \xd7 4 = 470.8). sigma_hat is also calculated using the recent 6 samples to reflect increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reliability confirmed as poor: P1 shipment lost, P3 shipment (191 units) overdue by 2+ periods beyond promised L=2. Effective planning lead time increased to L=3 for safety stock buffering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (last 5 periods) shows an average of 108.8 units (126, 91, 92, 127, 108), which is significantly higher than the initial January mean of ~86 units. This aligns with spring seasonality for blouses. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with significant backlogs of unmet demand. Lead time reliability remains a major concern: P1 shipment (107 units) is lost, and the P3 shipment (191 units) is now 5 periods old (3 periods past promised L=2), clearly overdue. Interestingly, the P5 shipment arrived in just 1 period. To mitigate the frequent stockouts caused by missing or late shipments, I will set L=3 to increase the base stock level (safety stock). I will use the mean of the last 5 periods (approx 109 units/period) to set mu_hat, resulting in mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 4 * 109 = 436.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time volatility is extreme; P5 arrived in 1 period while P3 (3/4 size of current pipeline) remains overdue by 3 periods beyond promised L. Demand remains stabilized at the higher 'Spring' level (~109/wk).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing a stretch cotton blouse with seasonal demand. Current demand (Periods 4-8) has stabilized at a mean of 109.6 units per week, significantly higher than the initial January baseline. Inventory health is poor due to unreliable supply: the Period 1 order (107 units) is confirmed lost, and the Period 3 order (191 units) remains missing after 6 periods (overdue by 4 periods). This suggests the Period 3 shipment may also be lost or severely delayed. Recently, however, deliveries from Periods 5, 6, and 7 arrived within 1-2 periods. I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed supply volatility. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (Periods 4-8) to capture the higher 'Spring' demand regime (avg ~110 * (1+3) = 440). Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures recent demand volatility to adjust the safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 3 order (191 units) now 4 periods past promised lead time; effectively treating as lost to avoid inventory stockouts. Demand regime remains stable at ~110 units/week.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909003 (Womens Tailoring Blouse) is in a high-demand spring regime. Recent demand (P6-P9) averages ~119 units/week, significantly higher than the initial samples. Inventory management is challenged by extreme lead time volatility and stockouts. Period 1 and Period 3 orders (total 298 units) are confirmed or effectively lost (P3 is now 5 periods past promise). Period 9 ended with 0 on-hand inventory after selling out. To prevent further stockouts despite the in-transit pipeline of 422 units (which includes the likely lost 191 units from P3), I am increasing the planning lead time to L=3 to ensure the OR backend calculates a higher safety stock. I will use the recent 4-period mean (~119.5) to set mu_hat for the (L+1) window (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly unreliable: P1 and P3 orders (total 298 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed; actual lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the product ('Gently tailored shirt') is in a stable spring demand regime. The average demand since the shift in Period 1 (excluding initial Jan samples) is approximately 112 units per week. Although the most recent demand (P10) was lower (63), the overall season suggests maintaining the higher mean. Lead time reliability is the primary concern: orders from P1 (107 units) and P3 (191 units) are long overdue and effectively lost. Validated arrivals have occurred with lead times of 1 and 2 periods (Avg ~1.4). However, given the lost shipments and the impact on service levels, I will keep L=2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat corresponding to the 'Spring' average (~112 units/week) multiplied by (1+L) to ensure the base stock calculation targets the correct period window. Pipeline inventory is currently 439 (Orders from P4, P10, and likely still carrying the ghosts of P1 and P3 in the backend's eyes), but the OR engine's cap and the logic of 'base_stock - pipeline' means we need to ensure mu_hat reflects current demand reality.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's tailored blouse. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial baseline (post-Feb 11 shift). Over the last 11 periods, the mean demand is approximately 109 units/week. However, the last two periods (63 and 78) suggest a potential slight cooling or variance. There is a severe supply chain reliability issue: Period 1 (107 units) and Period 3 (191 units) orders are confirmed lost, as they are now 11 and 9 periods past their order dates respectively. While the promised lead time is 2, actual successful lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P2 arrived in 2, P5 in 1, P6 in 2, P7 in 1, P9 in 1). Because of the 0 on-hand inventory and the history of lost shipments, I will use an explicit lead time L=3 to increase the base stock calculation, providing a safety buffer for the 'In-transit' units that might not arrive. mu_hat is set to the recent average (approx 105 per week) scaled by (1+L).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909003 (women's tailored shirt) is currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand: 0) with 479 units in-transit. A review of history shows that shipments from Period 1 and Period 3 (total 298 units) are lost, while more recent shipments (P9, P7, P6, P5) arrived with actual lead times of 1 or 2 periods. The pipeline inventory (479 units) is significantly inflated by these lost orders. To correct the base stock calculation, I must assume the P1 and P3 orders will never arrive. Demand has moderated from the initial Spring peak (~130) to a more stable recent average of approximately 82 units/week (last 3 periods: 63, 78, 86). I will set L=2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets (~82 * 3) units across the review and lead time periods, effectively signaling the need to replenish based on the actual recoverable inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P9-P12) has settled at 85 units/week, down from the early Spring peak of ~120. Period 1 and Period 3 shipments are confirmed lost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are in a post-Spring demand phase. The demand for the Rebecca/Delphine shirt (blouse category) has stabilized significantly lower than the February/March peak. The average demand for the last four periods (P10-P13) is roughly 74 units/week (63, 78, 86, 69). Our on-hand inventory is 0 due to recent stockouts caused by highly unreliable lead times and lost shipments (P1 and P3 orders, totaling 298 units, are confirmed lost as they are now >10 periods late). Currently, there are 479 units in-transit (P4, P10, P12 orders), though P4 is now extremely overdue and likely lost. Recent successful arrivals show actual lead times ranging between 1 and 2 periods. To protect against the high risk of lost orders while acknowledging the demand step-down, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to increase the safety stock buffer given the proven unreliability of the supply chain. mu_hat is set using N=4 (recent_N) to capture the stabilized lower demand of ~74 units/week, and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand has decreased from Spring peak to a stable range of ~74 units/week. Supply chain unreliability remains high with multiple confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, and likely P4).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/05/20), the demand for the 'Gently tailored shirt' has settled into a lower-volume regime following the Spring peak. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is approximately 75.8 units/week. Inventory is currently critical; on-hand is 0, and despite an in-transit pipeline of 439 units, deliveries have been highly unreliable. Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Only shipments from P2, P5, P6, P7, P9, and P12 have arrived, showing actual lead times fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods. To protect against the high stockout risk seen in recent periods, I set L=2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat based on the stabilized demand of ~76 units to ensure the base stock calculation (1+L=3 weeks) is grounded in current reality. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture the volatility in this lower-demand regime. This approach aims to restore inventory levels while acknowledging the high shipment loss rate.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. Demand for the 'Gently tailored blouse' has spiked again to 111 units in P15, mirroring the early Spring peak (~110-120) after a brief lull in P10-P14 (avg ~74). Supply chain reliability remains a major issue: orders P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (totaling 347 units), meaning the current 'In-Transit' figure of 439 is misleading. Subtracting lost orders, the realistic pipeline is 92 units (from P10). With On-hand at 0 and actual pipeline at 92, the system will trigger an order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent 1-2 period delivery variability and the risk of lost shipments, and mu_hat based on the recent 5 samples (P11-P15) to capture the return to higher demand levels (avg ~85, but P15 shows 111).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Recent demand jump from ~74 to 111 suggests a late spring/early summer resurgence. Realistic pipeline inventory is significantly lower than reported due to confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4 totaling 347 units).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand. Historical data confirms several lost shipments: P1 (107 units), P3 (191 units), and P4 (49 units) are significantly beyond the promised lead time of 2 and have no arrive signal, meaning 347 units in the reported 'In-transit' figure of 439 are effectively gone. The true pipeline inventory is only 92 units (ordered in P10). Demand has shown a recent jump to 111 (P15) before settling at 70 (P16), suggesting a summer return to demand levels seen earlier in the spring (~110-120). I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture this recent increase. Because of the frequent lost shipments and lead time unreliability (actual observed L varies between 1 and 2, but with high failure rates), I will explicitly set L to 3. This increases the base stock level to buffer against both supply chain failures and demand spikes. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) captures current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Period 1, 3, and 4 shipments (totaling 347 units) are lost. True pipeline inventory is significantly lower than system-reported 'In-transit'. Effective planning lead time should be at least 3 to account for frequent stockouts and delivery unreliability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), the system reports an In-transit inventory of 439 units. However, historical evidence (documented in Carry-over Insights from Period 5 to 17) confirms that orders from Period 1 (107 units), Period 3 (191 units), and likely Period 4 (49 units) are lost, totaling 347 phantom units. Subtracting these from the 439 in-transit units reveals a true pipeline of only 92 units (ordered Period 10). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last three periods has averaged approximately 85 units (111, 70, 73), showing volatility but a steady range. Given the extreme supply chain unreliability and frequent loss of shipments, I am setting the lead time (L) parameter to an 'explicit' value of 3. This increases the safety stock buffer and accounts for the fact that promised lead times (2) are frequently exceeded or never met. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current demand stabilizing around 85 units/week, and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This conservative approach aims to trigger orders that replenish stock while ignoring the 347 units that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: True pipeline correction: 347 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost; remaining valid pipeline is only 92 units. Effective planning lead time extended to 3 due to repeated delivery failures.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019-06-17), the SKU continues to suffer from extreme delivery unreliability and stockouts. Period 1 (107 units), Period 3 (191 units), and Period 4 (49 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 347 units that will never arrive. Although the system reports 'In-transit: 439 units', the true functional pipeline is only 92 units (ordered in P10, delayed by 8 periods now, but not yet explicitly written off). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has cooled from the Spring peak (~120) to a more modest late-spring average of ~75 units/week over the last 5 periods (P14-P18). Given the repeated failure of the supply chain (L=1 to 2 promised, but often infinity), I am setting L=3 to inflate safety stock levels. This compensates for the backend's ignorance of lost shipments and the effectively reduced pipeline. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent demand stabilization at a lower level (~75/week) while acknowledging the persistent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain reliability failure: 347 units (P1, P3, P4) are lost. Functional pipeline is 347 units lower than system 'In-transit'. L parameter set to 3 to force larger safety stock buffers against high delivery variance.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. Shipments from Periods 1, 3, AND 4 (totaling 347 units) are clearly lost, as they are now 15+ periods overdue. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 439 units, but 347 of these are phantom units that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is only 92 units (ordered after Period 4). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has trended downwards from the Spring peak (~120/wk) to a more recent average of ~55/wk over the last 3 periods (P17-P19). To compensate for the 347 units 'stuck' in the pipeline that the OR backend incorrectly counts as available inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I am targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom inventory. Estimated demand mean is ~70 units. With L=3 (to force higher safety stock due to 50% delivery failure rate), base stock should be (3+1)*70 = 280. To offset the 347 phantom units, I set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - phantom_units' results in a positive order. However, the backend 'cap' also limits orders. Setting mu_hat to a high explicit value forces the backend to recognize a higher inventory requirement despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand has settled into a late-June low regime, averaging ~64 units/week over P15-P19. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 347 (P1, P3, P4).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the SKU is entering the early summer period where demand has significantly dropped, averaging ~37.7 units/week over the last three periods (P18-P20). The supply chain is highly unreliable: 347 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' of 649 actually contains only 302 'real' units (one of which is likely the large P20 order of 210 units). Because the OR engine uses the full 'In-transit' figure, it will see 649 units and likely order 0. To ensure the engine maintains a base stock that covers the actual demand despite the ghost inventory in the pipeline, I will set L=3 (explicit) to increase the target safety stock and buffer against lead-time unreliability. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the sharp downward trend in demand, as using a longer window would severely overestimate current summer demand and lead to overstocking when the P20 order arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Early summer demand (late June/early July) has dropped to ~38 units/week. Real pipeline inventory is 302 units; the system-reported 'In-transit' of 649 units contains 347 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand has shifted into a low early-summer regime, averaging ~33 units/week over the last three periods (P19-P21). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with 347 units (from P1, P3, and P4) confirmed lost. The system shows an 'In-transit' of 649 units, which includes these 347 lost units plus the recently ordered P20 shipment (210 units) and other legacy items that haven't arrived. The actual functional pipeline is far lower than the system-reported value. To compensate for the lost units and force the OR backend to place an order despite the hyper-inflated 'In-transit' count, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock and 'explicit' mu_hat. I am using a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current demand drop (~33 units/week), but adjusting for the systemic inventory deficit caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at late-summer low of ~33 units/week (P19-P21). Inventory deficit of 347 units due to confirmed lost shipments persistent.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (2019/7/15), the demand for the shirt SKU has stabilized in a low summer regime. The mean demand over the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is approximately 42 units/week (33, 27, 39, 69). The spike to 69 in P22 suggests some volatility, but the overall trend remains much lower than the Spring peak. Total 'In-transit' is 439 units, but historical evidence confirms that orders from P1 (107), P3 (191), and P4 (49) are lost, totaling 347 units. The functional pipeline is therefore 439 - 347 = 92 units. The on-hand inventory is 141 units. To compensate for the 347-unit phantom inventory and the high delivery unreliability (multiple lost shipments), I set L to 3 to increase the base stock level and safety buffer. For demand, I'm using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower summer demand regime, ensuring the OR engine doesn't over-order based on high Spring historical data while still responding to the recent minor uptick in P22.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P19-P22) average consolidated at ~42 units/week, significantly lower than the ~110 units/week Spring average. Functional inventory correction persistent: 347 units in the 'In-transit' field are confirmed lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909003 (blouse) is currently in a lower demand regime during late July (avg ~45-50 units/week) compared to the spring peak. On-hand inventory is 88 units, which covers about 1.5-2 periods of current demand. However, the system-reported 'In-transit' of 439 units is misleading because it includes 347 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. The genuine functional pipeline is only 92 units (439 minus 347). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will adjust L to 'explicit' value 3. This increases the safety stock target and the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the current summer demand level (~44 units avg), which is more relevant than the long-term history encompassing the February/March spike.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-29. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer low regime, with the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging 42.4 units/week. On-hand inventory is 64. The system-reported 'In-transit' is 439, but 347 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost based on extensive historical delay. Thus, the 'functional' pipeline is 439 - 347 = 92 units. The OR engine subtracts total pipeline (439) when calculating the order; to prevent under-ordering while accounting for lost units, I must inflate mu_hat. I am using a demand forecast (recent_N with N=5) of ~42 units/week. Given the supply chain unreliability and frequent losses, I am maintaining L=3 to ensure a robust safety buffer. The OR backend will see 'In-transit: 439' and 'on-hand: 64'. To ensure it targets a functional base stock that accounts for the 347 lost units, I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods (~168 units) PLUS the 347 lost units, totaling approximately 515 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019-08-05), the SKU 507909003 (blouse) is in a late-summer lower demand regime compared to the Spring peak. Average demand over the last 7 periods (P19-P25) is approx 42 units/week. Supply chain reliability is a major concern: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 347 units) are confirmed lost, as they are now 20+ periods overdue. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 513 units, but 347 of these are phantom units that will never arrive. The 'True' pipeline consists only of the P25 order (74 units) and any other recent valid orders not yet concluded in history. To compensate for the lost logic in the OR backend which sees a full pipeline, I must set the base stock parameters higher. I will use L=3 to increase the safety stock buffer against lead time variability and use a Recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture the current stable summer demand of ~42/week while allowing the OR backend to process the higher base stock target required to overcome the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P19-P25) stabilized at ~42 units/week. Inventory correction: 347 units in the 'In-transit' field (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and will not arrive.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12), and demand for this blouse has slightly increased from the late-July low, with Period 26 showing a demand of 76 units. The product is a stretch cotton blouse, which tends to see early-autumn demand as customers prepare for the transition out of summer. The most recent demand regime (P22-P26) shows an average demand of approximately 54 units/week. Regarding inventory: The system reports 'In-transit' as 513 units. However, consistent history confirms that shipments from P1 (107), P3 (191), and P4 (49) are lost (totaling 347 units). The true functional pipeline inventory is 513 - 347 = 166 units (P25 order of 74 units + P9/P10/P12 remnants if any, effectively only P25 is reliable). Since we are currently at 0 on-hand, and the true pipeline is likely just the 74 units from P25, we are at risk of stockouts. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 5 periods (avg ~54) to capture the recent uptick from the summer floor, and maintain L=3 to account for the high historical delivery failure rate and lead time volatility, ensuring a larger safety buffer.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 507909003 (stretch cotton blouse) is currently in a late-August demand spike, with Period 27 demand reaching 136 units, significantly higher than the summer average (~42). This likely reflects 'Back to Work' or late-summer fashion shifts. Supply chain reliability remains a major issue: 347 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost, meaning the reported 'In-transit' of 439 is mostly phantom inventory; the true functional pipeline is only 92 units (439 - 347). To provide a sufficient safety buffer against both the demand spike and high delivery variance, I am maintaining an explicit L=3 and forecasting an elevated demand of 100 units/week (recent average reflects a jump). Setting mu_hat to 400 (4 periods * 100) and sigma_hat to 80 (sqrt(4) * 40) ensures the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to clear the phantom pipeline and meet local demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: August demand (Avg ~106) is significantly higher than July (Avg ~46), likely seasonal 'Back to Work' demand for blouses. Supply chain correction remains critical: 347 units in the In-transit reported field (from P1, P3, P4) are lost and will never arrive.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26, following a 'Back to Work' seasonal demand shift in August. Recent demand (P27: 136, P28: 85) averages ~110 units/week, similar to the Spring peak. Total In-transit is reported as 532 units, but 347 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, leaving a functional pipeline of only 185 units (P28 order of 93 + 92 units from another un-concluded recent order). I will use L=3 to maintain a higher safety stock buffer due to the history of shipment losses. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher August demand (approx 110/week) vs the July lows, ensuring the backend targets a stock level sufficient for the current regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. Demand for 'Back to Work' season (August onwards) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the July lows. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P27-P29) averaged 102.7 units (136, 85, 87). I will use N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent shift while smoothing the peak. Lead time remains erratic; although the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times range from 1 to 2, and several orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. Total confirmed lost units in 'In-transit' = 347. The backend 'In-transit' is 532, but real pipeline is 185. To compensate for this 347-unit phantom inventory and the risk of further losses, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to increase the target base stock and ensure enough new orders are generated to cover the on-hand deficit and provide a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-Work demand regime (August-September) established: Mean demand for P27-P29 is ~103 units/week. Supply chain remains unreliable with 347 units (P1, P3, P4) confirmed lost; phantom pipeline inventory continues to skew system logic.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the 'Back-to-Work' fall demand regime (September). Demand in P30 spiked to 164 units, bringing the mean for the last 4 periods (P27-P30) to approximately 118 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The system reported 'In-transit' is 439 units, but this includes 347 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. The functional pipeline is only 92 units (from an unlisted recent order, possibly P29/P30 logic not fully visible or the total reported 439 - 347 = 92). To compensate for the 'phantom' 347 units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat using an explicit value. Based on the current demand regime (~118/week) and a lead time of 2, the required base stock (L+1) should be ~354 units + safety stock. However, since the OR backend subtracts the full 439 from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost 347 units to ensure a real order is triggered. Target base stock (~420) + Offset (347) = 767. I use L=2 (explicit) to maintain the (L+1) logic while forcing the order through.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime for early September confirmed at ~118 units/week. Supply chain correction persistent: 347 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and must be offset in parameter logic to trigger replenishment, as they inflate the system's pipeline inventory view.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. This is the peak 'Back-to-Work' season for blouses. Analysis of the late August and early September demand (Periods 27-31) shows a sustained high-demand regime with an average of approximately 114 units/week (136, 85, 87, 164, 99). The system reports 758 units in-transit, but 347 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost based on carry-over history. This leaves a functional pipeline of 411 units (319 units ordered in P31 and 92 units from P28/P30 calculations, though P28 arrived already). With on-hand at 0 and a functional pipeline of 319 (P31 order), we are at risk of prolonged stockout. I am setting L=3 to increase the safety stock buffer due to the demonstrated supply chain unreliability and the high-demand season. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering the current regime) to capture the ~114 units/week mean. sigma_hat is set to explicit because the recent demand volatility (SD \u2248 35) combined with the L=3 parameter requires a robust safety buffer to prevent stockouts during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-Work regime (Sep) stabilized: Mean demand P27-P31 is ~114 units/week. Functional pipeline correction remains necessary: 347 units (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost and should be discounted from in-transit logic.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Back-to-Work' regime (September) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 114 units/week (P27-P32). In period 32, we finally received the P31 order (319 units) with a lead time of 1, leaving us with 225 units on-hand. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 439 units is heavily skewed by 347 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 107, P3: 191, P4: 49). Subtracting these lost units reveals a functional pipeline of 92 units (439 - 347). To correct for this inflation in the OR engine and ensure replenishment is triggered as we enter the end of September and look toward October demand, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating required base stock for L=2 (promised): (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 114 = 342 units. To offset the 347 phantom 'In-transit' units, I will set mu_hat to 689 (342 + 347). This forces the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) to see a net requirement of 342 units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to reflect the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'Back-to-Work' demand regime (Sep) stabilized: Mean demand P27-P32 is 114 units/week. Supply chain correction for 347 lost units (P1, P3, P4) remains active in parameter logic to prevent under-ordering due to phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 34 (2019/9/30) remains in the 'Back-to-Work' seasonal peak observed throughout September, with recent demand pulses reaching as high as 168 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P30-P33) is approximately 131 units/week. Supply chain reliability has stabilized recently (L=1 and L=2 for the last two successful deliveries), but the system's 'In-transit' count of 556 units is heavily inflated by 347 confirmed lost units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (calculated as 556 - 117 ordered in P33 - 92 ordered in P10 - 298 from P1/P3/P4). To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order despite this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. mu_hat is calculated to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (1+2=3) at the recent average of 131 units, plus a buffer to offset the 347 lost units. Target base stock is (3 * 131) + 347 = 740. Since the OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, I will set mu_hat to 740 to ensure the policy overcomes the 'In-transit' reporting error. sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility (30% of mu_hat) seen during seasonal transitions.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable September demand regime: Average 131 units/week (P30-P33). Supply chain correction for 347 units (P1, P3, P4) is permanent and requires mu_hat inflation to trigger replenishment.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for the 'Back-to-Work' regime (September) is established and stable, though highly volatile (P30-P34 demand: 164, 99, 94, 168, 83). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 121.6 units/week. Supply chain unreliability remains a critical factor: orders from Periods 1, 3, AND 4 (107, 191, 49 units respectively, totaling 347 units) are confirmed lost and have been 'In-transit' for over 30 periods. This 'phantom' inventory of 347 units causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it believes the pipeline is full. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is: Target Inventory for (L+1) periods = 122 units/week * 3 periods = 366 units. I add the 347 lost units to this target to force the system to reconcile the deficit. This results in a mu_hat of 713. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in the last 5 weeks. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P31, P28, P25) have arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-Work demand regime (Sept-Oct) average is ~122 units/week. Total confirmed lost units inflating In-transit is 347 (P1, P3, P4).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-10-14. We are in the 'Back-to-Work' demand regime (Sept-Oct) where demand averages approximately 122 units/week (P30-P35 avg = 118.5). On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' is 930 units, but this includes 347 units confirmed lost from the early periods (P1, P3, P4). The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P33 (117 units) and P34 (374 units), totaling 491 units. Lead time performance has been variable (1-2 periods), so I use an explicit L=3 to maintain a higher safety stock buffer given the high delivery uncertainty and recent stockouts. To overcome the OR backend's 'phantom' pipeline inflation (it thinks we have 347 more units than we do), I am explicitly inflating mu_hat. High-level goal: trigger replenishment by setting a base stock that exceeds the inflated in-transit figure. Targeted base stock \u2248 (Forecast * (L+1)) + Correction. Forecast (122) * 4 + 347 \u2248 835. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this adjustment.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Back-to-Work/Autumn regime (starting late August) has stabilized at approximately 111 units/week (average of P27-P36). Current on-hand inventory is 43 units. The reported 'In-transit' quantity of 842 units is severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (P1: 107, P3: 191, P4: 49, totaling 347 units). Additionally, P34 (374 units) has not arrived yet (expected L=2 would be P36 conclude, but it is now one period late based on a 2-period expectation). The actual lead time has shown volatility, with the most recent arrival (P33) taking 3 periods. To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 347 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat. This ensures the OR backend triggers a replenishment order by recognizing that the functional pipeline is insufficient to cover the (L+1) demand window. I will set L=explicit (3) to account for recent arrival delays and provide a safety buffer, and mu_hat=explicit at 791 (calculated as (1+L) * 111 mean demand + 347 lost units) to correct the inventory logic.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this blouse SKU has shifted into a lower late-autumn regime, with the last two periods showing 74 and 47 units respectively, down from the September 'Back-to-Work' peak (~131 units/week). The inventory situation remains complex due to the persistent 'phantom pipeline' of 347 confirmed lost units (from P1, P3, and P4) which inflate the system's 'In-transit' count of 861. Subtracting the 347 lost units, the functional pipeline is actually 514 units (from P34, P36, P37). The 374 units ordered in P34 are now overdue (L=4 if they arrive next period), confirming high lead time volatility. To manage this in the OR backend, I will set L=3 as the planning horizon to provide more safety stock. I will use a recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the shift down to ~77 units/week (last 4 periods: 103, 74, 47 plus current forecast). Crucially, to offset the 347 units of phantom inventory that prevent the backend from ordering, I will explicitly set mu_hat to (Expected Demand \xd7 (1+L)) + Lost Units. Expected demand is approx 80. So (80 * 4) + 347 = 667. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to ignore the stalled units.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn demand regime shift: Average demand decreased to ~77 units/week (P34-P37). Lead time volatility remains high, with P34 (374 units) now overdue (L>3). Persistent pipeline correction: 347 units (P1, P3, P4) remain lost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has decreased significantly in October, averaging ~50 units/week (P36-P38) compared to the September 'Back-to-Work' peak of ~120 units/week. Lead time remains volatile: Period 33 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 37 arrived in 1. Crucially, the 'In-transit' of 842 units is severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 347 units). Additionally, the large order from Period 34 (374 units) is now 4 periods old (overdue); if it is also lost, the functional pipeline is near zero. To force the OR backend to order despite the phantom 'In-transit' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=3 for safety) for a demand of 55 units/week: (1+3)*55 = 220. To offset the 347 'lost' units inflating the pipeline calculation, I set mu_hat to 220 + 347 = 567. This logic ensures the system attempts to maintain inventory for the current demand regime despite the supply chain noise.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime for late autumn (late Oct/early Nov) has stabilized at ~50 units/week. Lead time remains unpredictable (range 1-3+ periods). The 'In-transit' total includes 347 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P4) and an overdue shipment of 374 units (P34) that has reached L=4; if P34 does not arrive by next period, it will be considered lost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11. Demand has shifted into a late-autumn/winter low regime, with the last 4 periods (P36-P39) averaging approximately 55 units/week (down from the ~120 units/week seen in September). Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: The 'In-transit' figure of 813 units is heavily inflated by 347 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) and a 374-unit shipment from P34 which is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P34, currently P40). Treating P1, P3, P4, and P34 as lost makes the functional pipeline essentially 111 units (P35+P36+P37+P38+P39 orders). Because the OR backend relies on the (In-transit - Lost) calculation to trigger orders, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 721 units (347 + 374) of phantom pipeline. Given the low demand (55/week) and a planning lead time of L=3 (to account for volatility), a base stock of (L+1)*demand = 4 * 55 = 220 plus a safety buffer is needed. I will set mu_hat explicitly high to force the system to reconcile the 721 lost units while targeting the lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total phantom pipeline inventory reaches 721 units (P1, P3, P4 = 347 units; P34 = 374 units). Recent demand (P36-P39) has stabilized at a low regime of ~55 units/week.

Current date is 2019/11/18. Demand has stabilized at a low late-autumn regime, with the average of the last five periods (P36-P40) being approximately 53 units/week. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: there are 721 units confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed in the 'In-transit' field (P1, P3, P4 = 347 units; P34 = 374 units). P34 is now 6 periods past its order date (Promised L=2) and is treated as lost. Consequently, of the 1016 units reported 'In-transit', only 295 units are valid (Order from P40 and any smaller subsequent flows). To ensure the OR backend triggers replenishment despite the phantom inventory (721 lost units), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock as: (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units. With L=3 (to account for volatility) and expected demand ~55, the baseline requirement is 220 units. Adding the 721 lost units gives an explicit mu_hat of ~941. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the low demand volatility in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 721 units as P34 (374 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost along with P1, P3, P4 (347 units). Current demand regime (P36-P40) is stable at ~53 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the demand regime has settled at a late-autumn level. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand averaged ~49.8 units/week. Supply chain unreliability remains the primary challenge. The system reports 1016 units in-transit, but 721 units (P1: 107, P3: 191, P4: 49, P34: 374) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (P34 is 7 periods overdue). The 'true' functional pipeline consists of P40 (203 units), which is within expected lead time. To compensate for the 721 phantom units in the backend's 'In-transit' count (which prevents ordering), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on current demand (~50) and a planning lead time of 3 (L=2 promised + 1 safety): Target = (3+1) * 50 = 200. I then add the 721 lost units to this target to force the OR engine to place an order: 200 + 721 = 921. This ensures the backend sees (921 - 1016) and triggers replenishment adjusted for the missing stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; previous pipeline correction logic for 721 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P34) persists.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand for the blouse category has fluctuated significantly, with a recent spike to 141 in Period 42, up from an average of ~53 in the preceding 5 weeks. This suggests a seasonal 'Holiday' or 'Winter' demand surge. Regarding the pipeline, the system reports 1047 units In-transit. However, based on history, 721 units are confirmed lost (Period 1, 3, 4 = 347 units; Period 34 = 374 units). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from Period 40 (203 units) and Period 42 (31 units), totaling 234 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 721 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the current high-demand mean (approx 120/wk to capture the surge), a lead time of 3 (due to high variability), and then I add 721 to that value to offset the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (1+3)*120 + safety_stock (~150) + 721 = 1351. I set L=3 to account for observed delivery delays and losses.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge detected: Period 42 demand spiked to 141 units (vs ~53 avg in Nov). Total phantom inventory remains 721 units (P1, P3, P4, P34) and is skewing the system's order logic.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/9), we are navigating the early December holiday demand phase. Historical demand for blouses showed a significant spike in P42 (141 units) and remains relevant with upcoming year-end holidays. Recent demand average over P40-P43 is ~74 units. However, the system's order logic is severely compromised by phantom pipeline inventory. We have confirmed 721 units (P1, P3, P4, P34) as lost. The reported In-transit is 1249, but the functional In-transit is actually 528 (1249 - 721). If we use standard parameters, the OR backend will see 'over-inventory' and stop ordering, leading to stockouts. To force a replenishment order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a conservative holiday demand forecast (approx. 110 units/week) for L+1 periods (fixed at 3 periods for safety), then add the 721 lost units to the required total. Target = (3 * 110) + 721 = 1051. For sigma_hat, I'm using recent_N=5 to capture the recent volatility spike. L is set to calculated to reflect the actual observed delivery delays (avg L ~ 2.5-3).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand surge confirmed: P42 spike to 141 units. Pipeline correction of 721 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P34) remains mandatory to offset phantom inventory and sustain replenishment.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the middle of a holiday demand regime. While demand in P43-P44 was ~52 units, Period 42 saw a spike to 141. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 1249 units is heavily inflated by 721 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P34). Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 528 units. To ensure the OR backend triggers replenishment despite this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I am forecasting a mean demand of 110 units per period (accounting for holiday volatility and the P42 spike) over a planning horizon of L+1 = 4 (setting L=3 explicitly due to high delivery variance and recent 3-period lead times). This results in a mu_hat of 440 (110 * 4). I am using L=3 to increase the safety stock buffer against historically unreliable delivery (1-3+ periods).

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime (Dec): Demand volatility increased with a spike of 141 (P42), though subsequent weeks settled at ~52. Pipeline correction remains at 721 lost units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in the final periods of the game. Recent demand (P43-P45) has stabilized at ~51 units/week following a brief holiday spike (P42=141). On-hand inventory is healthy at 485 units, having received P42 (31 units) and P43 (405 units) in the last resolution. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 813 remains heavily inflated by 721 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P34). The actual functional pipeline is only 92 units (813 - 721). With only 2 periods remaining, 485 units on-hand more than covers the expected demand of ~51-60 units/week. To prevent unnecessary holding costs from arriving shipments that won't be sold before the game ends, I am setting mu_hat to a conservative level that recognizes the high on-hand balance. I will continue to use the explicit method for L=3 to account for the lead-time variability observed throughout the game, which provides a safer buffer if demand spikes again in the final week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (2019-12-30), the current demand regime for this blouse SKU has settled at approximately 52 units per week (average of P43-P46). We are moving out of the December holiday surge into the January post-holiday period. On-hand inventory is high at 433 units, while the 'In-transit' report of 813 units is heavily inflated by 721 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P4 = 347 units; P34 = 374 units). The functional pipeline is only 92 units (813 - 721). However, even with only 92 functional units in transit, the total functional position (433 on-hand + 92 in-transit = 525) is significantly higher than the projected demand of ~208 units over the next 4 periods (L+1 with L=3 safety). No new order is necessary. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 721 phantom units as valid supply and potentially under-ordering in future cycles, I continue to use an explicit mu_hat that covers expected demand while partially offsetting the phantom pipeline effect, though with 433 on-hand, the 'cap' logic will safely prevent ordering this period.
