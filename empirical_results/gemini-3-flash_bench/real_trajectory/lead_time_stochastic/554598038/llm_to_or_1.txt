Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 554598038 (Nora T-shirt). Historical demand shows a clear upward trend leading into mid-February: 0, 0, 11, 17, 38. This suggests a seasonal pickup for women's basic jersey t-shirts as we approach spring. The on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To capture the recent accelerating demand while acknowledging the limited sample size (5 points), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to prioritize the recent uptick (average of 11, 17, 38 is ~22/period). Since L=2, the backend will calculate mu_hat = (1+2)*22 = 66. For L, I will use the 'default' method (promised 2) as there is no observed history to suggest otherwise yet. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the increasing volatility seen in the last three samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 'Nora T-shirt', categorized under 'Womens Everyday Basics'. Demand is showing a clear upward trend: from initial zeros to 11, 17, 38, and most recently 54 in Period 1. This suggests we are entering a peak or growth phase for this basic item. The promised lead time is 2, and since an order was placed in Period 1, we don't expect it to arrive until Period 3 (conclude message read in Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and we lost 54 units of sales in Period 1. To address the sharp demand growth, I am using a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the 'growth regime' (averaging 17, 38, 54 = 36.3 per period). This results in a mu_hat of approximately 109 for the review+lead window (1+L=3). I am also using N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with this surge.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25) for the 'Nora T-shirt'. Historical demand shows a sharp upward trend (0, 0, 11, 17, 38) in the weeks leading up to the game, followed by actual demand of 54 (P1) and 100 (P2). This likely reflects a seasonal transition into Spring. Current 'In-transit' is 109 units (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2, meaning the P1 order (46 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P3. We have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost significant sales due to stockouts. To catch up with the rising demand (approx. 100+ units/period), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current high-growth regime and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for high volatility during this ramp-up phase. L is set to 'default' as we haven't confirmed a lead-time drift yet.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: transition from winter baseline (avg ~13) to spring ramp-up (P1=54, P2=100).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-04 (Period 4). The product is a Nora T-shirt, which is a spring/summer basic. Demand has surged significantly desde mid-February (P1: 54, P2: 100, P3: 113) compared to the January baseline (~13). This confirms a clear regime shift into the spring season. We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (46 units) should have arrived in Period 3 conclude, but 'arrived=0' was reported. However, based on the lead-time definition, an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3's arrival phase and is only visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. In this case, Period 3 conclude still shows 0 arrivals, suggesting the P1 order is delayed or lost. Because we have zero stock and demand is rising (averaging 89 over the last 3 weeks), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this growth and set L to 3 to account for the observed delay in the first shipment's arrival (which was expected to show up in the P3 conclude but did not). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both higher demand and longer lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average is 89 units vs initial baseline of ~13. Lead time delay observed: P1 order (L=2) not yet arrived by P3 conclude, suggesting actual L >= 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are observing the early spring peak for a women's basic T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 4 periods has been 54, 100, 113, and 88 (average ~89), a significant jump from the January baseline of ~13. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand has consistently exceeded availability. Regarding lead time: the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) during Period 4. However, the Period 1 order (placed with L=2) as of Period 4 conclude is still listed as 'arrived=0' or missing, which is highly irregular since P2 arrived. I suspect the P1 shipment (46 units) is lost. To recover from back-to-back stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 4 consecutive periods) and capture the spring demand, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 4-period average (~356 for 1+L periods) and maintaining L=2. The OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering, but recent_N ensures we are targeting the current high-demand regime rather than the low January average.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment loss suspected for Period 1 order (46 units); Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2). Spring demand regime remains stable at ~90 units/week.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are in the mid-March spring demand phase for the Nora T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (54, 100, 113, 88, 56) averages 82.2 units. The Period 1 order (46 units) is now definitively lost as it is 2 weeks past its expected arrival (promised L=2). The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The Period 3 order (83 units) was expected to arrive in Period 5 but did not, and the Period 4 order (140 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. My goal is to use the 'recent_N' method to capture the spring demand regime (N=5) and set lead time to 'calculate' to account for the mix of on-time and delayed/lost performance. I am using recent_5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the higher mean and volatility compared to the initial January baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: 5-period average (P1-P5) is 82 units, significantly higher than January baseline (~13). Reliability issues confirmed: P1 order lost, P3 order delayed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the Nora T-shirt is in a clear spring demand regime. The demand average for the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is approximately 85.6 units/week, a significant jump from the January baseline. Inventory management is struggling due to fulfillment issues: the P1 order (46 units) is officially categorized as lost (3 periods overdue), and while the P2 order arrived on time (L=2), the P3, P4, and subsequent orders are still in transit (269 units total). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. Given the promise of a 2-period lead time but the reality of a lost shipment and missing arrivals for P3 (L=4 if it arrives next), I am setting L to 3 to be more conservative. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current spring regime (avg ~86) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) observed since the ramp-up. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers 4 weeks of demand (L+1), helping to recover from the stockout as in-transit units arrive.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st, 2019. The product is a women's T-shirt, which is entering peak spring/summer seasonality. Demand since mid-February has averaged approximately 85 units per week (P1-P7: 54, 100, 113, 88, 56, 71, 114; Mean = 85.1). We are currently facing a severe stockout (On-hand: 0). The shipment history shows high instability: P1 order (46) is lost, P2 order (63) arrived in 2 periods, while P3, P4, and P7 orders are in-transit. Specifically, the P3 order (83) and P4 order (140) are significantly overdue (Promised L=2, now P8), which suggests either extreme delays or further losses. Despite 343 units in-transit, the system has 0 on-hand inventory to meet demand. I will set the lead time estimate to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual arrival behavior and use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand forecasting to capture the spring regime (avg ~85). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that attempts to bridge the gap between current stockout and expected arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime confirmed for Spring (Feb-Mar avg: 85 units/week). Supply chain instability persists: P1 order lost, P3 and P4 orders significantly overdue (>4 periods).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. Demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (a Spring/Summer staple) has been high and stable, with a recent 4-week average (P5-P8) of approximately 87 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Specifically: the P1 order (46 units) is long lost; the P2 order arrived on time (L=2); the P3 (83 units) and P4 (140 units) orders are severely overdue (>4 periods since ordering) and should likely be treated as lost or significantly delayed; the P7 order arrived early (L=1). Because P3 and P4 orders are still technically 'in-transit' but haven't arrived, they inflate the pipeline inventory, preventing the OR backend from ordering more. To force an order and mitigate consistent stockouts, I will set L=3 (reflecting the observed average/instability) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 90 units/week; for (L+1)=4 weeks, this is 360 units. However, I must manually discount the 'zombie' in-transit units from P3 and P4 (223 units combined). Setting mu_hat to 600 will overcome the pipeline inflation and ensure the base stock levels are high enough to trigger a replenishment order to cover the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: shipment loss/severe delay for P3 and P4 orders (total 223 units); demand remains stable at ~90 units/week for the Spring season.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's t-shirt entering the spring/summer peak. Total 'In-transit' is 459 units, but historical analysis suggests significant supply chain unreliability: Period 1 (46 units), Period 3 (83 units), and Period 4 (140 units) orders are severely overdue and likely lost. Specifically, Period 3/4 orders are now 6-7 periods past their order date, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2. Only Period 2 (L=2) and Period 7 (L=1) arrived. Due to these likely losses, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are missing demand. Recent demand (P7-P9) is rising: 114, 107, 122 (avg ~114). I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for potential delays and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current upward trend (114 * (1+3) = 456). Although the backend sees 459 'In-transit', if it calculates based on L=3, the target inventory will be high enough to trigger new orders despite the 'ghost' pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend increasing in April: 3-period average rose to 114 units/week (+27% vs previous 90 units/week baseline). Supply chain remains highly unreliable with estimated 60% shipment loss rate (P1, P3, P4 lost).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/22. The product is a women's T-shirt, which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Since Period 7, demand has shifted significantly higher, averaging 119 units/week over the last 4 weeks (P7: 114, P8: 107, P9: 122, P10: 133). While the promised lead time is 2, recent arrivals (P7 and P9 orders) arrived in just 1 period. However, earlier orders (P1, P3, P4) remain lost or severely delayed. To protect against this supply chain volatility and the rising seasonal demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will forecast a weekly demand of 125 units. Given the actual lead time L=1 observed recently, the base stock should cover L+1 = 2 periods of demand plus safety stock. I'll set mu_hat to 250 (125 * 2) and leave sigma_hat relatively high (50) to handle the demand variance and shipment uncertainty. This strategy ensures we maintain enough inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to satisfy the current 120+ unit/week run rate while the stock from Period 10 (57 units) is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for April: weekly average is 119 units, up from 90 (+32%). Observed actual lead time for recent successful shipments is 1 period, despite 60% historical shipment loss rate.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th, heading into the peak summer season for women's T-shirts. Demand has surged to 164 units in Period 11, confirming an upward trend from the April average (119) and the previous spring baseline (90). On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory is 269 units, which includes the Period 1 (46), Period 3 (83), and Period 4 (140) orders. Since these are now 11, 9, and 8 periods overdue respectively, they are confirmed lost. The backend OR engine does not account for lost shipments, so I must adjust mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation triggers a new order to replace this 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Using an explicit mu_hat of 525 is calculated as follows: My target base stock is (L+1) * Expected Demand. With L=2 and expected demand ~175 (anticipating continued seasonal growth), target inventory is 525. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (269) from base stock, I set mu_hat=525 so that base_stock - 269 leaves a sufficient reorder quantity to cover the current demand spike and replenish the stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in late April: Period 11 demand reached 164 units (+64% vs Spring baseline). Severe supply chain loss confirmed: Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (269 units total) are lost and will not arrive.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13 (early May). Demand for 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) is high, with a 3-period average of 149 units (P10-P12: 133, 164, 150). This represents a clear shift from the previous average of ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The supply chain remains unstable; orders from P1, P3, and P4 (269 units total) are definitively lost. While the promised lead time is 2, recent successful arrivals from P7 and P9 showed an actual lead time of 1 period. To account for the stockouts and the loss of earlier orders, I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover the current high-demand regime for the (L+1) horizon. I am using an explicit forecast of 150 units/week to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that compensates for the high demand and pipeline depletion.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for late Spring / early Summer: 3-period average (P10-P12) is 149 units/week, a 65% increase over the previous 90-unit baseline. Actual lead time for successful shipments is currently 1 period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019/5/13). The product is a 'Nora T-shirt', which is a high-demand item for late Spring and Summer. Demand has shifted into a higher regime: the 5-period average (P9-P13) is 137.4 units. Although Period 13 saw a slight dip to 118, the overall trend remains much higher than the early Spring average. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern; we have confirmed losses of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 269 units). While the promised lead time (L) is 2, recent successful arrivals from P7 and P9 showed an actual lead time of 1, but P12 (ordered 2 periods ago) has not yet arrived, suggesting L=2 or L=3 is more likely. With 0 on-hand inventory and 481 in pipeline (including potentially lost older shipments), we must set parameters that allow for a sufficient inventory buffer. I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat to 450 (covering 3 periods of ~150 demand), and sigma_hat to 75 to account for volatility and potential delays.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime: 5-period average (P9-P13) is ~137 units/week. Supply chain remains erratic with lead times fluctuating between 1 and 2+ periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 15 (May 20), entering the Summer season for this Nora T-shirt. The current demand regime has stabilized following the late April peak, with a recent 5-period average (P10-P14) of 137.4 units. Period 14 demand was slightly lower at 122 units, suggesting a potential plateau in demand. The supply chain has shown severe reliability issues, with shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 269 units) confirmed as lost in 'In-transit' counts. Actual lead times for successful shipments have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P12 arrived in 2 periods). I am setting L to 2 to be conservative given the history of delays. To protect against the high loss rate (roughly 50-60% of units ordered historically), I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the current 5-period average (137.4) * (1+L) = 412.2. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility of the Spring/Summer surge.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a women's T-shirt (Everyday Basic), currently in a high-demand late spring/early summer regime. Demand remains strong with a 5-period average (P11-P15) of 141.4 units. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 323 units, comprising orders from P1 (46 - lost), P3 (83 - lost), P4 (140 - lost), and P15 (54 - pending). Since P1, P3, and P4 orders (269 units) are significantly beyond the promised lead time and have been flagged as lost in carry-over insights, they must be discounted from the pipeline. The effective pipeline is only 54 units. To ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods (approx 425-450 units) and to compensate for the severe stockouts caused by high loss rates, I will use recent demand history (N=5) and set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current 140+ unit demand level. Holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but due to the high volatility and stockout frequency, I will use default sigma calculation to maintain a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: May/June high demand regime confirmed: 5-period average (P11-P15) is 141 units/week. Effective pipeline severely reduced by confirmed loss of P1, P3, and P4 shipments (269 units total).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the product 'Nora T-shirt' is in a high-demand early summer regime. The last 5 periods (P12-P16) show an average weekly demand of approximately 138 units, with a standard deviation around 17 units. The supply chain remains unpredictable. While the promised lead time is 2, actual successful arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P9 in 1, P12 in 2). Crucially, shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 269 units) are confirmed lost, as they are now over 12 periods overdue. The current 'In-transit' of 425 units includes these 269 lost units, meaning the *true* effective pipeline is only 156 units (P15 order of 54 and P16 order of 102). With on-hand inventory at 0 and weekly demand near 140, we are facing significant stockouts. I will set L to 3 to account for potential delays and use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture the current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 140+ unit weekly demand across the lead time despite the pipeline swelling with phantom units.

Carry-over insight: True pipeline audit: 269 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost; effective pipeline as of P17 is 156 units. Weekly demand regime for May/June is approx. 140 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10, representing peak Summer demand for a basic jersey T-shirt. The demand regime over the last 5-8 periods (May/June) has stabilized around 130-140 units/week. Specifically, the average of the last 4 periods (P14-P17) is 136 units. On-hand inventory is 33 units. The in-transit pipeline officially shows 396 units, but 269 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights and extreme historical delay. Subtracting these losses leaves an effective pipeline of 127 units (the P17 order). Recent successful arrivals (P7, P9, P12, P15, P16) show lead times of 1 or 2 periods, with an average of 1.4. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the confirmed demand and account for the lost stock that it still 'sees' as valid pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 140. Given the effective pipeline is 127 and we seek a base stock covering ~350 units (L=1.5), this should trigger a necessary re-up.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/17 (Mid-June). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has been in a high-demand regime since April, though Period 18 saw a dip to 82 units. The 5-period moving average (P14-P18) is ~125 units/week. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand. The total 'In-transit' of 396 units is severely inflated by the confirmed loss of orders from P1, P3, and P4 totaling 269 units (46+83+140=269). Adjusting the pipeline: 396 (reported) - 269 (lost) = 127 units effective pipeline (this is the P17 order). Lead times for successful shipments recently fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the current decision period (P19) plus the lead time (L=2), and accounting for the high possibility of shipment loss or volatility, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 5-period average (capturing the 120-140 range) and L to the promised 2. The OR backend will subtract the (inflated) pipeline; however, the cap mechanism and mu_hat setting must ensure we place an order to cover the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: 269 units in-transit (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline as of P19 is 127 units. Demand remains in the Summer regime of ~125-140 units/week.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019, positioned in the Summer demand regime. Recent demand (P17-P19) has averaged 110 units, slightly lower than the May peak but still substantial. The product is a women's t-shirt, consistent with steady Summer demand. A critical audit of the supply chain shows 'In-transit' as 396 units, but 269 of these (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only 127 units (from the Period 17 order). With 0 on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline that only covers approximately 1 period of demand at the current average, a restock is necessary. Lead times for successfully delivered orders have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P15: 2, P16: 1, P12: 2, P9: 1). I will set L to 2 to be conservative given the history of delays and losses. Mu_hat is set using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current Summer stabilization (avg ~126), and Sigma_hat is calculated similarly to account for recent volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is a summer-appropriate 'Nora T-shirt', and historical demand has settled into a summer regime of approximately 125-140 units/week. Recent data shows a 3-period average (P18-P20) of 117.6 units/week, though P20 spiked to 144. The supply chain remains problematic: 269 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and must be factored out of the 'In-transit' count (396 - 269 = 127 units effective pipeline). The effective pipeline consists of the P17 order of 127 units. As of P21, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P15 was 2, P16 was 1). I will set L to 2 to be conservative given the history of delays. For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current summer baseline (approx. 125 units), providing a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (June/July): Weekly average fluctuates between 120 and 145 units. Effective pipeline audit at Period 21: 269 units (from P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost; only 127 units remain in the physical pipeline (ordered P17).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Nora T-shirt is in its summer demand regime. Historical demand from Period 17\u201321 shows a range between 82 and 144 units, with a 5-period average of approximately 118 units/week. While on-hand inventory is currently 0, the 'In-transit' figure of 396 units is misleading. As noted in the carry-over insights, 269 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost. The only valid shipment in the pipeline is the 127 units ordered in Period 17, which is now significantly overdue (promised L=2, now P22). Given the 60% historical shipment loss rate and current stockout, I must place an order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (~118 * 3 = 354) and use explicit sigma to account for higher volatility and supply chain unreliability. Since L=2 is the promised lead time and recent arrivals varied between 1-2 periods, I will stick to 'default' L but use an 'explicit' mu_hat reflecting the current ~120 unit demand regime to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that compensates for the effectively empty pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Audit P22: Confirmed in-transit inventory effectively zero as P17 order (127 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, following the pattern of P1, P3, and P4. Demand remains stable in the 115-125 range.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the 'Nora T-shirt' is in its peak summer season. Demand from P18-P22 (last 5 periods) has averaged 110 units/week, though it has slightly dipped recently. However, the most critical issue is the supply chain: the in-transit balance of 396 units is composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 46, P3: 83, P4: 140 = 269 total) and the P17 order (127 units), which is now 6 periods old and clearly lost given the 1-2 period actual lead time observed for successful deliveries. Effectively, on-hand and pipeline inventory are both ZERO. Since the OR engine's capped policy uses pipeline inventory to limit orders, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the defunct promised lead time and the ghost pipeline. I will set L to 1 (the fastest observed lead time) to encourage immediate fulfillment, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect a baseline demand of ~115 units per period. Setting L=1 and mu_hat=230 (covering 1+1 periods) tells the engine we need stock for the current and next period immediately.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline audit P23: Total 396 units in transit (P1, P3, P4, P17) are confirmed lost and will not arrive. Effective pipeline is zero. Summer demand stabilized at ~110-115 units/week.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22. Demand has stabilized in a summer regime, with the last 4 periods averaging 114.5 units (P20: 144, P21: 113, P22: 84, P23: 117). The total in-transit quantity of 396 units consists of orders from P1 (46), P3 (83), P4 (140), and P17 (127). Given that P1, P3, and P4 are over 20 periods old and P17 is now 7 periods old (with a promised lead time of 2), I have confirmed all 396 units are lost. Consequently, effective on-hand and pipeline inventory is 0. I will set L to 2 (promised) as it remains the baseline despite the reliability issues. I choose \u03bc\u0302 using the recent 4-period average (representing the current stable summer demand) to target ~115 units per week, adjusted for (1+L). Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility in that same period to ensure a consistent service level despite the stockouts.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a women's jersey T-shirt, which is a summer staple. Historical data shows demand has stabilized in the mid-summer regime, with recent weekly demands of 113, 84, 117, and 106. The 4-period moving average is approximately 105 units. Significant supply chain issues have occurred: shipments from periods 1, 3, 4, and 17 (totaling 396 units) are now strictly overdue (P17 is 8 periods old, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and the observed max of 2). As noted in carry-over insights, these 396 units in 'In-transit' are considered lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is 0. To restart supply and meet the stabilized summer demand, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period window (P20-P24) and keep L at the default promised value of 2 to allow the OR backend to trigger an order. Using recent_N for sigma_hat will capture the current lower volatility compared to the spring ramp-up phase.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline audit Period 25: All 396 units currently 'In-transit' (from P1, P3, P4, P17) are confirmed lost based on excessive delays; effective pipeline is zero. Summer demand stabilized at ~105 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), we are in the late summer demand cycle. Historical analysis confirms that the 396 units currently labeled as 'In-transit' (from P1, P3, P4, and P17) are permanently lost shipments, meaning our effective pipeline and on-hand inventory are both currently zero. Demand has stabilized in the 100-110 units/week range over the last three weeks (P23=117, P24=106, P25=104). We haven't placed an order since Period 17, and with zero stock, we are losing all demand. To recover, we must place a significant order to cover the (L+1) period demand window. Given the extreme reliability issues (multiple lost shipments), I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat at 315 units (approx. 105 per week for 3 weeks) and sigma_hat at 50 to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger a large recovery order against the 'phantom' pipeline of 396 units. The OR backend subtracts the pipeline, so to get a physical order of ~300+ units, mu_hat must be set to compensate for the 396-unit ghost in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand stabilized: 3-period avg (P23-P25) is 109 units/week. Supply chain reliability has collapsed: P17 (127 units) now confirmed lost alongside P1, P3, P4 shipments ($ total 396 units in phantom pipeline).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are in the late-summer demand regime for the Nora T-shirt. Demand has stabilized over the last 4 periods at an average of 102 units/week (P23: 117, P24: 106, P25: 104, P26: 83). The supply chain is highly unstable. Current In-transit is 703 units. A critical audit reveals a significant 'phantom' pipeline: shipments from P1 (46), P3 (83), P4 (140), and P17 (127) totaling 396 units are long overdue (>9 periods) and confirmed lost. The recent order in P26 (307 units) is the only active shipment. We assume a lead time (L) of 2 periods based on the promised service, though reliability is poor. To ensure the base-stock calculation considers only viable inventory, I will set L=2 and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the stable late-summer demand (N=4). The OR engine will subtract the 703 units (including 396 lost ones) from the target base stock. To compensate for these 396 lost units that the engine thinks we have, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high: (1+L)*102 + 396 = 702. This effectively forces an order to cover the current demand plus the missing stock, while staying within the backend's safety cap.

Carry-over insight: Late Summer demand regime (August) stabilized at ~102 units/week. Supply chain remains broken: 396 units in the 'In-transit' total (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, leaving only the Period 26 order (307 units) as valid pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Demand analysis shows a shift from the peak summer regime (approx. 110-140 units/week) toward an end-of-summer/early-autumn baseline. Recent demand (P26-P27) has dropped into the 70-80 units/week range. A recent_N of 5 is chosen for mu_hat to capture this cooling trend (average approx. 94 units/week). Regarding lead time and pipeline: the 'In-transit' figure of 703 units is heavily inflated by ghost inventory. Confirmed lost shipments: P1 (46), P3 (83), P4 (140), and P17 (127), totaling 396 units. These units must be accounted for by the OR parameters because they will never arrive but still count against the OR engine's internal base-stock calculation. To counteract the 396 phantom units in the pipeline and ensure an order is triggered to meet the upcoming demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a forecast of 90 units/week for 3 periods (L=2) and then add 396 to that requirement. Base Stock target = 90 * (2+1) + 396 = 666 units. This ensures the OR logic [Base Stock - In_Transit] results in a positive order that reflects current physical needs rather than the corrupted system state.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand contraction confirmed: weekly demand has dropped from ~110 to ~75 units over the last 3 periods (P25-P27). Phantom pipeline inventory persists at 396 units (P1, P3, P4, P17).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for this basic cotton T-shirt is in a clear end-of-summer contraction phase. The demand has dropped from a stable summer peak of ~110-140 units down to a 3-period average of 75.7 units (P26-P28: 83, 69, 75). Supply chain analysis remains critical: the system shows 703 units 'In-transit', but historical data confirms that 396 of these (from P1, P3, P4, P17) are definitively lost. The only valid pipeline inventory is the 307 units ordered in Period 26. Since these have not arrived by the start of P29 (P28 conclude), and the promised lead time is 2, they should arrive during the resolution phase of P29 and be visible in the P30 start message. This arriving stock (307 units) will more than cover the current demand regime (~75 units/period) for the next 3-4 periods. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent contraction (N=3) and rely on the existing valid pipeline to meet needs without placing additional orders until the 'phantom' stock is processed by the OR logic or the valid stock arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand contraction confirmed for late August: 3-period average dropped to 76 units/week, down ~30% from early Summer levels. Valid pipeline audit: only 307 units (P26) are expected; the remaining 396 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30 (2019/09/02), the demand for the Nora T-shirt continues its seasonal descent, consistent with the end of the summer jersey basic cycle. The 3-period average (P27-P29) has dropped to 69 units/week, significantly lower than the mid-summer average of 110. Lead time remains unpredictable but averages around 2, though several shipments are effectively lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 703 units is heavily inflated by 396 units (P1, P3, P4, P17) that are confirmed lost. The only valid pipeline shipment is the 307 units ordered in Period 26, which is now 4 periods old and potentially suspect, but remains our only hope for stock. Given on-hand is 0 and valid pipeline might be 307, I will use recent_N (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower late-August/early-September demand regime, while keeping L at the promised 2 to avoid over-ordering into a phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift: 3-period average (P27-P29) is 69 units/week, confirming a sustained contraction from summer peaks (~110 units).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), we are deep into the post-summer demand contraction for the Nora T-shirt. Demand has consistently declined from ~110 units in July to a 3-period average of 60.7 units (P28-P30). We are holding onto a massive 'phantom' pipeline of 396 units (P1, P3, P4, P17) which have been confirmed lost over several months. Additionally, the order from P26 (307 units) is now 5 periods old; since the promised lead time is 2 and recent successful deliveries arrived in 1-2 periods, this P26 order is now highly suspect and likely lost as well. Total in-transit is 703 units, with likely 0 units actually reaching us. To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline preventing the OR engine from ordering, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to forcing the base stock level higher based on the current September demand regime (~60 units/week) multiplied by (L+1). I estimate L as 2 (promised), so (2+1)*60 = 180. However, the backend sees 703 units in transit. To force any order, base_stock must exceed 703. Since demand is actually falling, I will set mu_hat conservatively to avoid over-ordering once the supply chain resets, but high enough to reflect the current 60-unit regime. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the soft start and the recent decline.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: 3-period average (P28-P30) is 61 units/week, down 45% from summer peak. Supply chain collapse: Period 26 order (307 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, joining the 396 units already confirmed lost (Total phantom pipeline: 703 units).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September demand (P28-P31: 75, 64, 53, 37) shows a sharp, sustained contraction as we exit the summer season for basic T-shirts. The 3-period average has dropped to 51 units/week. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' total of 703 units is almost certainly phantom inventory. These units (from P1, P3, P4, P17, and now P26 which is 5 periods overdue) are confirmed lost based on historical performance where successful deliveries arrived within 1-2 periods. With zero on-hand and an effectively empty pipeline, I must re-order to meet the new, lower demand level. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the current downward trend while discounting the high summer peaks, and set L to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure the OR engine accounts for the promised lead time without being misled by the 'arrived=0' history caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: September demand contraction confirmed: 4-period trend (P28-P31) shows decline from 75 to 37 units (Avg: 57). Total phantom pipeline now 703 units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P26) confirmed lost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for the Nora T-shirt is in a clear seasonal contraction phase as summer ends, with the last four periods showing a decline from 64 to 29 units (average ~46 units/week). The inventory situation is critical: there are 703 units 'In-transit', but based on historical evidence and the current period (P32), all of these units are confirmed lost. Specifically, the P26 order (307 units) is now 6 periods old, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and the observed successful lead times of 1-2. With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 0, a replenishment order is necessary despite the low demand. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the promised lead time while acknowledging the high risk of loss. For mu_hat, I'm using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the latest September contraction (avg ~46). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the lower volatility in this lower-demand regime. This should trigger an order that fills the gap between zero stock and the safety level required for the next 3 weeks (L+1).

Carry-over insight: September demand contraction confirmed: 4-period average (P29-P32) is 46 units/week, down from late-summer levels of ~100 units. Total phantom pipeline now 703 units (P1, P3, P4, P17, P26) confirmed lost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Sept 30, entering the fall season. Demand for this t-shirt SKU has significantly contracted from its summer peak of ~140 units to a 4-period average of 41 units (P30-P33), confirming a seasonal shift. Regarding supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 703 units consists entirely of 'phantom pipeline' (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P17, and P26) which are all 8+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Consequently, the effective on-hand and pipeline inventory is zero. To rebuild a lean inventory for the lower fall demand regime while minimizing holding costs (which equal profit), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods to capture the current mean of ~41. L is set to 'calculate' to use the average of delivered shipments (approx 1.5 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility of the current regime. This profile ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the 2-per-week lead time risk without over-ordering into a declining season.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Fall demand regime: avg 41 units/week (P30-P33), a 70% decrease from Summer peak. Total phantom pipeline (lost orders) reached 703 units; effective pipeline is currently 0.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' t-shirt is in a clear Fall contraction. The 4-period average (P31-P34) is 33.75 units/week, down from Summer peaks of ~110-140. More critically, the supply chain is extremely unreliable. The 'In-transit' quantity of 703 units is composed entirely of lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P17, P26), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its target, I must use 'explicit' mode to bypass this phantom inventory. I will set mu_hat based on the current Fall demand regime (approx 35 units/week across L+1 periods) and a conservative L=2. Setting mu_hat to 105 (35 * 3) and sigma_hat to 20 provides a base stock that should trigger a new order since the OR engine will see 105 - 703 as a negative requirement, however, the capped policy might limit this. By providing these explicit values, I'm forcing the backend to ignore the long-term averages and focus on the immediate low-demand reality while trying to signal that we have no real stock.

Carry-over insight: Fall demand regime (October) identified: average has stabilized at ~35 units/week. Phantom pipeline reached 703 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P17, P26 all confirmed lost).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. We are in a confirmed Fall demand regime for the Nora T-shirt, which has seen demand stabilize at significantly lower levels (avg ~35 units/week) compared to the summer peak. Analysis of the last 4 periods (P32-P35) shows demand values of 29, 45, 24, and 16, resulting in a recent mean of 28.5 units/week. The supply chain has proven highly unreliable, with 703 units 'In-transit' from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 26 now confirmed as lost/phantom inventory. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. Given on-hand inventory is also zero, we must place an order to cover the (L+1) horizon. We set L to a calculated average based on successful historical arrivals (typically 1-2 periods) while mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned to the recent Fall regime (N=4) to prevent over-ordering in a declining seasonal window.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Winter low-demand regime confirmed: demand has stabilized at ~25-35 units/week in October, a 75% decrease from Summer peak levels. Effective pipeline remains zero as 703 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598038' (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is currently in a late-Fall low-demand regime. Analysis of the last 5 periods (P32-P36) shows demand has dropped significantly, averaging 26.2 units/week, which is a 75-80% decrease from the summer peak. The supply chain remains highly unreliable; the 'In-transit' quantity of 703 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 26, all of which are far beyond any reasonable lead time and are confirmed lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. Given the current date (Oct 21), we expect this low-demand baseline to continue into the winter. I am setting L=2 (default) but will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (avg ~26 units). Because the backend's base-stock calculation is (mu_hat - pipeline), and the backend incorrectly sees 703 units in the pipeline, it would normally order zero. To bypass this and ensure we maintain stock for the current demand, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom pipeline. However, since the prompt specifies mu_hat is compared against pipeline_inventory, and my pipeline is effectively 703 while my real need is ~80 (for 3 periods), the backend will not order unless I use 'explicit' to override. To ensure we have stock for the current 30 units/week demand while the backend thinks we have 703 units coming, I will set mu_hat to a value that forces an order: current target base stock (~80) + phantom pipeline (703) = 783.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Fall/Winter transition confirmed. Demand stabilized at ~25-30 units/week. Phantom pipeline (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P17, P26) remains at 703 units; effective pipeline is zero.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt remains in a stable late Fall/Winter regime, with recent demand (P34-P37) averaging 21 units/week (24, 16, 17, 27). The long-term 'In-transit' figure of 783 units is misleading because 703 units (from P1, P3, P4, P17, and P26) are confirmed lost based on extensive delays exceeding 5-10 periods. The only valid pipeline shipment is the 80 units ordered in Period 37. Since lead time has historically been 1-2 periods for successful shipments but reliability is extremely low, I will use an explicit L of 2 to ensure coverage over the procurement cycle. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods of the current low-demand regime (avg ~21) to avoid overstocking during this slow season, while maintaining a sigma_hat that accounts for the variation seen in the recent stabilization phase.

Carry-over insight: Fall/Winter low-demand regime stable: 4-period average (P34-P37) is 21 units/week. Effective pipeline audit: Period 37 order (80 units) is valid; all previous 703 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the November period, which in the historical demand data (provided as 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) showed initial zero demand before a rise in late January/early February. Current October demand has bottomed out at approximately 12-25 units per week (Period 38 demand was 12). The supply chain remains highly unreliable; while the Period 37 order arrived in 1 period, the total 'In-transit' figure of 703 represents units from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 26 that are confirmed lost. My effective pipeline is currently 0. I will set L to 1 based on the most recent successful delivery and use a small N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand winter regime (~17-25 units/week) without being influenced by the summer peaks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late Fall/Winter season (mid-November), where demand for a short-sleeve jersey T-shirt is naturally at its lowest annual baseline. History shows demand has stabilized at ~12 units/week over the last two periods (P38-P39). The current on-hand inventory of 56 units is sufficient to cover approximately 4+ weeks of this low-level demand, especially given the observed actual lead time of 1 period for the recent P37 order. The 'In-transit' count of 703 remains composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P17, P26) and should be ignored for planning. Since on-hand inventory (56) is already higher than the projected base stock for the next 3 weeks (L+1 demand \u2248 12 * 3 = 36), no new order is required. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 captures the current local mean of ~17 units/week, which accounts for the most recent trend.

Carry-over insight: Winter baseline demand confirmed: weekly demand has stabilized at ~12-15 units/week in November, down from the October average of ~25 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt has stabilized in the Winter baseline regime (November), with recent demand samples (P38-P40) being 12, 12, and 8 units. The 3-period average is approx. 10.7 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 48 units, which effectively covers over 4 weeks of demand at this current rate. Regarding the supply chain, while the system shows 703 units 'In-transit', these are historical orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 26 that have long since exceeded any reasonable lead time and are confirmed lost. The only valid recent shipment (P37) arrived in 1 period. Given the current excess inventory (48 units) relative to the low demand regime (~11 units/week), no new orders are necessary. I will set the mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (N=4) to ensure the base stock calculation accurately targets the current low-demand environment and prevents further over-ordering while the system burns through existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand baseline confirmed for November: average has dropped to 10-12 units/week. Effective pipeline remains zero despite the 703 'In-transit' units shown, as those shipments are confirmed lost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt remains stable in its winter baseline regime, with an average of approximately 11-12 units/week over the last 4 periods (P38-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 33 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 3 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' total of 703 units is confirmed as phantom inventory (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 26) and must be ignored. Effective pipeline is zero. Given the current low-demand volatility (\u03c3 is low) and our existing stock, no new order is required this period. The OR parameters are set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current winter low-demand mean (~11.75) and standard deviation, which will lead the OR engine to maintain a base stock that is\u5df2\u7ecf satisfied by our 33 units on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Nora T-shirt remains in a stable Winter baseline regime, with the most recent four periods (P39-P42) showing demand of 12, 8, 15, and 18 units respectively (average ~13). We are currently in early December. The in-transit inventory of 703 units is confirmed as phantom inventory (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 26), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 15 units, which is approximately equal to one week of demand. With a promised lead time (L) of 2 and an actual observed lead time for recent successful orders of 1 period, maintaining a small buffer for the current low-demand regime is appropriate. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-week average to reflect the current winter baseline and use calculate for L to leverage observed lead times. Since holding cost equals profit (1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock approximately equal to the mean demand over (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand baseline confirmed for Period 39-42: average 13 units/week. Effective pipeline is zero as all 703 in-transit units are confirmed lost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598038 is in a stable Winter demand baseline as of early December, with demand averaging approximately 13 units per week over the last five periods (P39-P43: 12, 8, 15, 18, 11). Current on-hand inventory is 4 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 703 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 17, and 26, and is treated as zero for replenishment purposes. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat), I must set parameters that reflect the current low-demand regime while accounting for the phantom pipeline. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5), I capture the current ~13 unit/week demand. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed successful deliveries. With 4 units on hand and 0 effective in-transit, the OR engine will trigger a small replenishment order to satisfy the expected low winter demand (approx. 40 units for 1+L periods).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019 (Period 45). Demand has stabilized at a winter baseline of approximately 10-15 units per week (P40-P44 average: 12 units). On-hand inventory is now 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 703 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P17, P26) as confirmed in previous carry-over insights; therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. Since we are entering the final periods of the game (45 of 47) and the current on-hand inventory is depleted, I will set mu_hat to cover the remaining periods at the current stable winter demand rate. L is set to explicit '1' based on the most recent successful delivery (P37 order arrived in 1 period), and mu_hat is set to (1+L)*12 = 24. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value to reflect the low volatility of the winter baseline.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline remains zero; 'In-transit' 703 units are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P17, P26). Winter demand baseline (Dec) is stable at ~12 units/week. Final successful lead time observed was 1 period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 23, 2019, which is the peak holiday season/winter period for the 'Nora T-shirt'. Historically, demand for this basics item dropped from summer peaks (>100 units) to a stable winter baseline of approximately 10-15 units/week in November and December. The last 5 periods (P41-P45) show demand of 15, 18, 11, 8, 15, averaging 13.4 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). While 'In-transit' shows 703 units, these items are from orders placed between Months 2 and 8 (P1, P3, P4, P17, P26) and are confirmed lost; the effective pipeline is zero. The most recent successful delivery was in P38 with a lead time of 1 period. To minimize holding costs for this low-demand winter period while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the 13 units/week baseline. Given the significant history of lost shipments, I will use an explicit L of 1 to ensure the system attempts to restock quickly for the current period's needs, but I will not over-order as demand is low and the inventory is balanced against high holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the deep winter season (late December). Historical data from January/February 2019 and the last 6 weeks (P40-P46) show demand has bottomed out at a baseline of approximately 10-15 units per week. The 7-period average (P40-P46) is exactly 12 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods to capture this stable winter baseline. Sigma_hat is set using the same window to reflect current low volatility. Regarding the pipeline, 703 units are 'In-transit' but have been confirmed lost over nearly 40 periods; however, the internal OR backend will subtract these from the target base stock. Since the target base stock for a lead time of 2 and demand of 12 will be around 35-45 units, and 'In-transit' is 703, the OR engine will naturally output an order of 0. This is the correct behavior because we already know the demand is minimal and the system effectively has no real on-hand stock or reliable incoming shipments. Setting L to calculate allows the backend to use the most recently observed lead times (the last successful one was L=1 at Period 38).
