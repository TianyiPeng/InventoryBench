  "rationale": "Product Analysis: The SKU is a 'Virgo Hip belt', a women's accessory. Demand Analysis: Historical data shows demand started at 74 and peaked at 220 in mid-January, trailing off to 107 by early February. The average of the last 5 periods is 138. Forecast: Given the decline in February, I expect demand to stabilize around the 110-130 range. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0. Timing: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts for Period 1, 2, and 3 (the periods before a new order placed now would arrive), I must cover current and pipeline demand. Since the system resolves arrivals AFTER my decision, my order must account for the lead time gap. Ordering 400 units targets approximately 3 periods of demand (approx 133 units/period) to build initial stock and meet upcoming demand cycles.",

(b) Recent performance: Demand in the last four periods was 157, 239, 130, 105. The average is ~158, though the last two weeks suggest a downward trend towards ~117. I will forecast demand at approximately 125 units per week for safety. (c) Lead time: Period 4 conclude shows an arrival from Period 2 (Lead Time = 2).

Lead Time Inference: The order from P1 (400 units) has not arrived after 5 periods and is confirmed lost. The order from P2 (150 units) arrived exactly on its 2-period lead time (arrived P4). This confirms the actual lead time is 2 periods. 2. Pipeline Analysis: Currently on-hand is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P3 (200), P4 (150), and P5 (100) totaling 450 units (the 'lost' 400 from P1 are still mathematically in-transit but ignored for planning). 3. Arrivals: The P3 order (200 units) is expected to arrive during P6 (this period). The P4 order (150 units) is expected to arrive in P7. 4. Forecast: Average demand is ~140 units over the last 10 observations, but recent weeks are lower. To cover the lead-time window (P6, P7, P8), I need to satisfy demand for 3 periods (~420 units total). 5. Calculation: Target Stock (3 periods) = 140 * 3 = 420.

In Period 8, we received 300 units (orders from P6 and P7), leaving us with 210 units on-hand. Lead times are inconsistent, appearing as either 1 or 2 periods. The Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (400), P3 (200), and P4 (150) are lost, as they are significantly past the 2-period window. Calculating pipeline: On-hand is 210. In-transit shown as 900 likely includes these 750 lost units plus the Period 8 order (150). Therefore, the 'real' in-transit is likely 150 units. Total coverage (Effective Inventory) = 210 (on-hand) + 150 (P8 in-transit) = 360 units. Given a 2-period lead time, we need to cover demand until the end of Period 11 (3 periods of demand). At ~100/period, we need 300 units plus a safety stock of ~100 to handle potential spikes or shipment delays.

Excluding these from the 'In-transit' 1410 units leaves an effective pipeline of 150 units (from Period 23). On-hand inventory is 274 units. This provides a total effective stock of 424 units. With demand averaging ~80 units, this covers over 5 periods of supply. Since lead time is ~2 periods and holding cost equals profit ($1.00), excess inventory is as costly as stockouts. I will not place an order this period to allow the on-hand inventory to deplete further toward an optimal safety level.",

Current demand is in the range of 60-100 units per week (Period 39: 80 units). The pipeline reconciliation is critical: the 'In-transit' total of 1610 units contains 1560 units that have been confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19, 23, and 34).

Total effective inventory (On-hand 157 + Pipeline 200) equals 357 units. Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 40, 41, and 42. Estimating a conservative demand of 90 units/period, we need ~270 units. Current effective inventory covers this, but to maintain safety stock against the intermittent shipping losses and the confirmed lead time volatility (1-3 periods), an order is required to maintain a buffer for Period 43.",
