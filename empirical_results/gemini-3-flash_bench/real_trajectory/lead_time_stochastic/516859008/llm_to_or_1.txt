Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we must establish a baseline. The SKU is a 'James basic hip belt' in the women's accessories category. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks (13, 5, 15, 28, 31) shows a clear upward trend starting around late January, likely corresponding to early spring fashion retail cycles. The mean demand is 18.4, but the most recent two weeks are significantly higher (avg 29.5). Given the upward trajectory, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent growth while smoothing the spike. The promised lead time (L) is 2. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L=3) periods based on the recent trend. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the profit/holding cost ratio (critical ratio ~0.95), ensuring high service levels during this growth phase.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The product is a women's hip belt. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a significant upward trend: 13, 5, 15, 28, 31. Period 1 demand was 39, which was entirely lost due to 0 starting on-hand inventory. This confirms a sustained demand increase (+26% from the last history point). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen in the upward trend. The promised lead time is 2, and the order placed in P1 (39 units) is in-transit. Per the timing rules, we shouldn't expect it until Period 3 or 4, so L=default is appropriate for now.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from an average of ~9 in early Jan to 39 in Period 1 (upward trend confirmed over 4+ samples).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019/2/25). On-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 84 units (39 from P1, 45 from P2). The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (L=2) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in the P1 and P2 conclude messages is normal behavior for L=2. Demand is showing a significant upward trend: 13, 5, 15, 28, 31 (pre-game) and 39, 53 (Periods 1 & 2). The average demand of the last 4 samples is 37.75, showing a clear acceleration. To capture this growth while maintaining an aggressive service level (due to high profit/holding ratio of 19:1), I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 to prioritize the most recent demand surge, and set L to default as there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: Average demand rose from ~11 (first 3 samples) to ~38 (last 4 samples), a 245% increase.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product 'James basic hip belt' is experiencing a sharp upward demand trend (13, 5, 15, 28, 31 in pre-history; 39, 53, 66 in Periods 1-3). The average demand over the last 3 periods is 52.6, significantly higher than the early January average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 141 units are in-transit. The order from Period 1 (39 units) is expected to arrive in the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3 (viewable in Period 4 conclude) based on the promised lead time of L=2. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, suggesting the Period 1 order is either delayed or arriving during Period 4's resolution (which we will see in Period 5). Because we started with 0 inventory and haven't received anything yet, we are currently losing all sales. To capture this growth, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to focus on the recent high-demand regime (avg ~53). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increasing volatility. L remains default (2) for now as we don't have enough data to confirm a permanent lead time shift versus a 1-period delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 1-3 demand (39, 53, 66) shows a clear linear increase compared to pre-game levels. Current 3-period average is 52.7 (+380% vs early Jan). Possible lead time delay: Period 1 order (L=2) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $855.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516859008' exhibits a significant upward demand trend from Jan/Feb (starting ~13 units/week) to March (reaching 66 and currently 52). We have a critical inventory shortage; previous demand has consistently exhausted on-hand inventory immediately upon arrival. While Period 4 conclude shows an arrival from Period 2 (lead time = 2), the Period 1 order (39 units) is notably missing/missing from the conclude summary\u2014either it was lost or there is some data reporting delay. However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised 2-period lead time. I will maintain L=2 (promised). For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods (39, 53, 66, 52) show a high-growth regime averaging 52.5. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this shift. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level, ensuring the OR engine calculates a robust base stock to prevent further stockouts as we enter mid-March.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). Period 1 order (39 units) appears lost or delayed indefinitely as it was not reported in Period 4 conclude.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens basic hip belt', which typically sees growing demand in spring (March/April) as fashion seasons transition. History shows a lost or severely delayed shipment from Period 1 (39 units), as the P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2) but the P1 order has not arrived by Period 5 conclude. Periodic demand surged in P1-P4 (39, 53, 66, 52) but dropped to 26 in Period 5. This drop might be a result of out-of-stock signaling or a temporary fluctuation; however, the spring seasonality suggests demand will likely remain higher than the pre-Feb levels. Since the Period 1 order is likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure of 189 contains 39 ghost units, meaning effective pipeline is actually 150. Based on the last 5 demand samples (39, 53, 66, 52, 26), the mean is 47.2. With a lead time L=2, mu_hat should target (1+2)*47.2 = 141.6. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime while accounting for the recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (39 units) is confirmed lost/delayed (P2 arrived in P4 but P1 did not). Effective pipeline inventory is (In-transit - 39).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'James basic hip belt' (Accessories). Current date is 2019/3/25. History analysis: The Period 1 order (39 units) is confirmed lost/delayed as P2 and P5 orders have already arrived. Total in-transit is 152, but after adjusting for the lost 39 units, the effective pipeline is 113 (P3: 57, P4: 56, P6: 0). Lead time is variable: P2 arrived in 2 periods, but P5 arrived in only 1 period. Demand has stabilized somewhat but remains high compared to pre-game; the last 4 periods average 47.5 (66, 52, 26, 46). Given on-hand is 0 and we have a stockout, I need to ensure the effective pipeline + new order covers (L+1) demand. I will set L=2 to be safe despite the recent P5=1 result. To account for the lost shipment in the OR backend's capped policy calculation, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to raise the base stock level, effectively 'asking' for the missing units to be replaced while the OR engine subtracts the (inflated) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P2 took 2 periods, P5 took 1 period. Demand stabilization: Post-spike average (P3-P6) is 47.5 units/period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The SKU (James basic hip belt) experienced a demand peak in Feb and has since stabilized. The post-spike average demand (P4-P7) is 44 units per period. Regarding lead times: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period, and P1 is confirmed lost (7 periods since ordering). Total in-transit is 233 units, but 39 of these (P1) are lost, leaving a reliable pipeline of 194 units (P3: 57, P4: 56, P7: 81). The P3 order (57 units) should arrive during Period 8 (today), but I must plan for (L+1) demand. Given current on-hand is 0 and demand is ~44, I need a total base stock (on-hand + pipeline) to cover roughly 3 periods of demand (132 units). Since my reliable pipeline (194) already exceeds this, the OR engine's capped policy will likely result in a zero or small order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stabilized mean of 44, and 'calculate' for lead time to let the engine observe the 1-2 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized post-Feb peak: Average demand for P4-P7 is 44.0. Reliable pipeline excludes 39 units from P1 (lost).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/08. Demand for the 'James basic hip belt' has stabilized after the initial February/March spike. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is 45.8 units/period. The lead time appears to have shifted from the promised 2 periods to a more frequent 1-period arrival (P5 arrived in P6, P7 arrived in P8), though P1 remains lost/delayed indefinitely. I will set L to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect this faster arrival trend. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stabilized post-peak demand level (~46 units/period). This results in mu_hat \u2248 (1+1)*46 = 92. Since the order from P1 (39 units) is confirmed lost/delayed and the OR engine doesn't account for this, the pipeline inventory of 152 is effectively 113. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent stable demand will help the OR engine maintain a sufficient base stock for the current regime without over-ordering based on the early February surge.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trend has shifted to 1 period (confirmed by P5 arriving in P6 and P7 arriving in P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516859008' (James basic hip belt) is currently experiencing high demand relative to supply. Period 9 demand was 52, continuing a stable post-spike average (P4-P9 average is 46.8). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The Period 1 order (39 units) is confirmed lost/delayed indefinitely, as arrivals for subsequent periods (P2, P5, P7) have already concluded. The actual in-transit pipeline that will arrive is 113 units (152 total in-transit - 39 lost). Recent arrivals confirm a lead-time shift: P5 arrived in 1 period and P7 arrived in 1 period. Therefore, I will set L to 1. For demand (mu_hat), the last 6 periods (P4-P9) show stability around 47 units/period; using N=6 for recent_N. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to capture this stabilized volatility. This configuration aims to replenish the stock-out while accounting for the shortened lead time and the missing Period 1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time reduction: Orders from P5 and P7 both arrived in 1 period, suggesting a shift from the promised L=2 to an actual L=1. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 47 units (P4-P9 average is 46.8) following the initial February spike.

The SKU 'James basic hip belt' is experiencing a significant demand surge, likely due to spring fashion trends or Easter shopping (2019/4/21), with demand jumping to 95 units in Period 10\u2014a clear break from the previous stable mean of ~47. History shows a shift in lead time from the promised L=2 to an actual L=1 (confirmed by arrivals in P6 and P8). The Period 1 order (39 units) remains lost/delayed, so the effective pipeline is (152 - 39) = 113 units. Since we are currently at 0 on-hand and just experienced a 95-unit demand spike, we must adjust parameters to bridge the gap. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 1 to reflect the recent empirical lead time. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the sudden demand spike of 95, resulting in (1+L)*95 = 190. Sigma_hat is set to its default to provide a safety buffer for this new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected in Period 10 (95 units, +100% vs recent avg), possibly seasonal/Easter-related. Lead time remains consistently 1 period (actual) despite L=2 promise.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic hip belt. Current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand shows a baseline around 45-50 units, but with recent volatility: Period 10 saw a spike to 95 (likely Easter/Spring seasonal demand) and Period 11 saw 64. On-hand is 0. The Period 1 order (39 units) is confirmed lost/delayed indefinitely. Pipeline inventory is 244 units (excluding the lost P1 units, effective pipeline is 205). The lead time has shifted from the promised 2 periods to an actual 1 period based on multiple recent arrivals (P5, P7). I will use L=1 (explicit) to align the OR engine with real-world observations. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher Spring demand average (Periods 8-11 mean = 66) to ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy current demand levels (1+L=2 periods worth of demand).

Carry-over insight: Spring seasonal demand confirmed: Average demand for late-April (P10-P11) is 79, significantly higher than the previous stabilization mean of 47.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and we are seeing a significant sustained demand regime. The average demand for the last three periods (P10-P12) is 84.7 units, which is much higher than the previous baseline of ~47 units. This corresponds to the spring/pre-summer season for women's accessories. Lead time is physically observed to be 1 period (P5 and P7 arrived in 1 period), but looking at recent history, orders from P10 and P11 have not arrived yet; however, P10 was 'ordered=0', so only the P11 order (92 units) is currently expected. The P1 order (39 units) remains lost. Current total in-transit is 244 units. Of this, 39 are lost (P1) and 92 were ordered in P11. With an actual lead time of 1, the P11 order should have arrived in P12 conclude, but it didn't. This suggests the lead time may have reverted to the promised 2 periods or is experiencing delays. To be safe, I will set L to the promised 2 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the high spring demand (avg ~85) and an explicit sigma_hat to account for high volatility (P10-P12 demand: 95, 64, 95).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime in May (P10-P12): average demand increased to 84.7 units/period (+80% vs previous stabilization of 47). Lead time reliability is fluctuating (shift from 1 period back toward 2 periods).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516859008' (Womens hip belt) is currently in a high-demand regime, likely driven by spring/summer seasonality. Demand for the last 4 periods (P10-P13) has averaged 86.8 units (95, 64, 95, 93), a significant jump from the earlier stabilization mean of ~47. This high demand is causing frequent stockouts because on-hand inventory is zero and sales are capped by arrivals. Lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods (the P11 order arrived in P13). Total in-transit inventory is 212 units, which consists of the lost P1 order (39 units), the P13 order (60 units), and the order currently being placed. Excluding the lost P1 order, the reliable pipeline is 60 units. I will set L to 2 (promised/recent) and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand spring regime (approx. 87 units/period). Setting sigma_hat for 4 periods ensures protection against the high volatility seen in this category.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Spring/Summer) confirmed for late April/May: average demand is 86.8 units (P10-P13), representing an 85% increase over the previous stable mean of 47.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime associated with the Spring/Summer season (Womens accessories/belt). Demand in the last period (P14) spiked to 118 units, reinforcing the upward trend. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 93 units/period, compared to the previous stabilization mean of 47. We are currently facing a stockout (on-hand=0) with sustained high demand. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; P11 arrived in 2 periods, while P13/P14 orders are still in transit. To prevent further stockouts during this seasonal peak, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new high average (approx 93 * (1+L)). I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility in this regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed 1-2 period arrivals, acknowledging that the actual L is often shorter than the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime in late Spring/early Summer (May) confirmed: average demand for P10-P14 is 93.0 units, a 98% increase over the previous stable mean of 47. Period 14 saw a peak of 118 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516859008' (Womens hip belt) is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime throughout May (Periods 10-15), with an average demand of 95.7 units per period and a recent peak of 118. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory of 334 units includes the lost P1 order (39 units), making the effective pipeline 295 units. The actual lead time has stabilized back to the promised 2 periods (as seen by P11 arriving in P13). To ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) periods of demand at the current high-demand rate, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 samples (P10-P15) to capture this specific seasonal surge. Sigma_hat is also calculated over these 6 samples to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter is set to 'default' as the actual lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained May demand regime (P10-P15): average demand is 95.7 units/period, representing a significant seasonal peak for this accessories category. Actual lead time has returned to 2 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the product (women's belt) is finishing a high-demand seasonal peak that occurred throughout May. The average demand for the last 5 weeks (P12-P16) is 100.8 units, though demand has tapered slightly since the mid-May peak of 118. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 340 units in-transit. The lead time appears to have stabilized at 2 periods (P11 arrived in P13, and subsequent arrivals are currently within the 2-period window or pending). Specifically, orders from P13 (60), P14 (92), P15 (30), and P16 (6) are in the pipeline. Note that 39 units from P1 remain lost/delayed and should be mentally excluded from effective pipeline inventory. To ensure we capture the current stabilized high-demand mean for the forecast (mu_hat), I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P11-P16).

Carry-over insight: Post-May peak demand stabilization: Average demand for late May/early June (P12-P16) remains high at ~101 units/period, but growth has stalled compared to early May.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 304 in-transit. In Period 17, demand dropped significantly to 67 units after a prolonged high-demand period (avg ~101). This suggests the late Spring/early Summer peak for this fashion accessory (hip belt) is tapering off as we move further into June. We observe high lead time volatility: P15 took 2 periods, while P16 took only 1 period. The P1 order of 39 units remains lost. Effective pipeline is 304 - 39 (lost) = 265. Given the high pipeline relative to the softening demand, I will set L to recent_N (N=3) to account for the mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the cooling demand (avg 95.2 vs previous 101+) while still maintaining enough safety stock to cover transitions. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate coverage for the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening detected in June: Period 17 demand (67) is 30% lower than the late-May average (101), indicating the seasonal peak is ending.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (June 17), we are observing a seasonal demand transition for the hip belt. Following the May peak (avg >95), demand has softened in June (Period 17: 67, Period 18: 63), indicating the peak accessories season is ending. The average demand for the last two weeks is 65.0. Regarding lead times, while the promised L=2 persists, we have observed actual delivery times of 1 and 2 periods recently. Inventory is critically low with 0 on-hand, and we have 377 units in-transit (including the confirmed lost Period 1 order of 39 units, leaving effectively 338 units). Period 11's order was missing, but Period 15 and 16 arrived in Period 17, and Period 13 and 14 are currently near or past their expected 2-period window. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current downward trend from the peak to the present (avg ~71), and keep L=2 (promised) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock targets are sufficient to rebuild on-hand inventory once the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening confirmed in June: Demand dropped from May peak (avg 95.7) to current June average of 65.0 (P17-P18), a ~32% reduction.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Historical demand shows a clear seasonal peak in May (avg ~96) followed by a softening trend in June. The June average (P17-P19) has stabilized around 71 units (67, 63, 83), showing significant reduction from the May highs. Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P18 arrived in 1 period, while P15 took 2). Given this volatility and the downward demand trend, I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the historical average lead time for safety. mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent post-peak June demand level (~71/period) while ignoring the higher May outliers. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the current demand variability. The Period 1 order (39 units) remains lost and is ignored in pipeline considerations.

Carry-over insight: June demand softening confirmed: Post-May peak average (P17-P19) is 71 units, a ~26% decrease from the May average of 95.7.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. Historical analysis shows a clear seasonal pattern: a significant demand spike in May (average ~95), followed by a cooling-off period in June (average ~70). In Period 20, demand was 64, continuing this stabilization Trend. I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the most recent 4-period regime (P17-P20) which reflects this post-peak stabilization (average 69.25). The actual lead time has been fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P18 arrived in P19, L=1; P15/16 arrived in P17, L=2/1). Given the promised lead time of 2, the safer parameter is L=2 to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand during this off-peak phase. On-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 304 (which includes a legacy lost order of 39 from Period 1 and more recent orders from Period 13/14 that likely timed out or are delayed). By using recent_N for both mu and sigma, the backend will target a service level optimized by the profit/holding cost ratio (95% critical ratio) using the stabilized June/July demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization in June/July confirmed: Average demand for P17-P20 is 69.3 units, down ~27% from the May peak.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'James basic hip belt' has stabilized after the May peak. The current demand regime (since Period 17, covering late June to early July) shows an average of 69.3 units per period (67, 63, 83, 64, 73). Consequently, N=5 is chosen for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-peak level. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P18 took 1, P15 took 2, P16 took 1), but the promised lead time is 2. The OR backend uses L to define the look-ahead window. Total pipeline inventory is 304 units, but this includes a lost shipment of 39 units from Period 1 (confirmed by Period 6 carry-over); true pipeline is 265. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times (approx 1.6 periods), which is appropriate given the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization confirmed for late June/early July: average demand for P17-P21 is 70.0 units, following the May peak (~96 units).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the James basic hip belt has stabilized after the May peak. For the period P17-P22 (mid-June to early July), demand has averaged 73.3 units (67, 63, 83, 64, 73, 90). The previous 'recent_N' logic in the insights suggested a mean around 70, but we see a slight uptick in P22 (90). The pipeline inventory is currently 304 units, but this includes the 39 units from P1 which are confirmed lost/delayed indefinitely (effective pipeline is 265). There are also significant gaps in arrivals: P13 (60 units), P14 (92 units), and potentially later orders have not arrived. Lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods. To maximize service level while accounting for the lower post-May demand regime, I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilization trend (approx 73 units/period). Lead time will be set to 'calculate' to weight the historical mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand stabilization (mid-June to July) confirmed: average demand for P17-P22 is 73.3 units, significantly lower than the May peak (~96 units) but showing a minor uptick in the latest period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516859008' is currently in a stable post-peak regime (late July). Average demand for the last seven periods (P17-P23) is 74.4 units, with a slight upward trend in the most recent samples (90 and 81). The lead time has been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods throughout the game. Given that the promised lead time is 2, I will use 'calculate' to capture the historical average behavior while acknowledging this variance. Pipeline inventory currently stands at 304 units, but this includes a 39-unit order from Period 1 that is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 265 units. Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand, and we are heavily reliant on the arrival of orders placed in early June/July which are significantly delayed or are finally nearing arrival (P13, P14 orders were for 60 and 92 units respectively and should have arrived). To ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock for the current 74.4 unit/period demand, I will use the recent 7-period average for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the stabilization following the May peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/7/29. Demand has transitioned from the May seasonal peak (~96 units) to a stabilized June/July regime (P17-P23 avg ~ 75 units). Period 24 saw a significant drop to 38 units, which may signal a late-summer slowdown or volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 304 units. Note that 39 units from Period 1 remain lost/delayed and are likely unusable. The pipeline consists largely of orders placed during or just after the high-demand period; however, no arrivals have been recorded in the last 5 periods (P20-P24). Lead time has been volatile, ranging from 1 to 2 periods, but the recent absence of arrivals suggests either a significant delay or that no orders were placed between Periods 19 and 24 (which is true based on the history). Because the current pipeline of 304 units (effective ~265) is very high relative to the recent demand of 38-81 units, I will set parameters to stabilize. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat (N=7 to cover the post-peak period) and sigma_hat to reflect current stabilization, and use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR engine account for the historical variability.

Carry-over insight: Late July demand softening detected: Period 24 demand (38) is ~50% lower than the June/July average (75), suggesting a potential end-of-summer regime shift.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/5. We are seeing a shift out of the high-demand spring/summer peak. Period 24 demand was 38 and Period 25 was 73. The average for the last two periods is 55.5, which is lower than the June/July stabilization of ~73 and significantly lower than the May peak of ~96. The product is a basic hip belt, which likely sees a softening in late summer. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 304 units in transit (excluding the lost 39 units from P1). The OR backend calculation for base_stock will account for the large pipeline, so I need to set mu_hat to reflect the cooling demand to prevent over-ordering as we enter August. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the 80s down to the 60s/70s range (P23=81, P24=38, P25=73; mean=64). Lead time has been volatile but recently averaged around 1-2 periods; 'calculate' is appropriate for L. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility without overestimating based on the massive May spikes.

Carry-over insight: Late July/Early August demand softening confirmed: Average demand for P23-P25 is 64.0 units, down ~13% from the June/July average of 73.3.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). Demand has transitioned from the May peak (avg ~96) and June/July stabilization (avg ~70-75) into a slightly softer late-summer regime. The last three periods (P24-P26) showed demands of 38, 73, and 66, averaging 59 units. This represents a downward trend from the previous regime. Lead time has been volatile throughout the year, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods; setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR backend to use the historical average for these fluctuations. Given the recent softening, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level (59 units/period * (1+L)), and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this new phase. Note that the in-transit inventory is high (304 units), which includes the lost Period 1 order (39 units), so effective pipeline is ~265 units, which is still substantial relative to current demand.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime shift: Average demand for P24-P26 is 59.0 units, a ~19% decrease from the June/July stabilization average of 73.3 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. Demand for this SKU (James basic hip belt) peaked in May (~96 units/period) and has settled into a lower stabilization regime during June, July, and early August. The average demand over the last four periods (P24-P27) is 63.75 units, confirming a downward shift from the previous regime of ~73 units. Although Period 27 saw a slight uptick (78), the overall trend for August is lower. Regarding Lead Time: the promised L is 2. Historically, we have seen actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods (P15 took 2, P16 took 1, P18 took 1). The pipeline currently contains 304 units (excluding the ancient lost shipment from P1), which is very high relative to current demand levels. No new order is needed at this time as the pipeline is sufficient to cover several periods. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (N=4) to reflect the recent softening, and use 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the historical variability between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime shift confirmed: Average demand for P24-P27 is 63.8 units, a ~13% decrease from the June/July stabilization average of 73.3 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516859008' (Womens hip belt) is currently experiencing a demand stabilization phase following late-summer softening. Recent demand (P24-P28) shows a mean of 69.2, which is higher than the August dip previously observed but lower than the May peak. The system has 304 units in-transit, but 39 of these (from P1) are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 265 units. Even with this correction, the pipeline is substantial compared to current demand. Lead times have oscillated between 1 and 2 periods; using the capped policy (z* = 2.05), we set mu_hat to capture the recent stable regime (N=5: P24-P28) to ensure we don't over-order against this large pipeline. The target base stock will be compared against the effective pipeline by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-August dip (P24-P28) has settled at a mean of 69.2 units/period. Effective pipeline is 265 units (Total 304 - 39 lost from P1).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for the 'James basic hip belt' has stabilized after a volatile August, with the average demand from Period 24 to 29 being approximately 69.0 units. On-hand inventory remains at 0 with a massive in-transit pipeline of 304 units. However, based on history, 39 units from Period 1 must be considered lost, making the effective pipeline 265 units. There have been no arrivals since Period 19, despite significant orders in the pipeline from earlier periods (Periods 13 and 14 orders total 152 units that have not arrived in over 15 periods). This suggests a catastrophic supply chain failure or extreme lead time delay. Given the promised lead time L=2, but the actual observation of a stalled pipeline, I will set L to 2 but use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the current post-August stabilization of 69 units/period. The pipeline (265 effective) currently far exceeds the expected base stock for L=2 (approx 3*69 = 207), so the OR backend will correctly result in 0 new orders today while we wait for the significant backlog to arrive to avoid excessive holding costs once the 'logjam' breaks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained pipeline stalling: No arrivals since Period 19 despite 265 effective units in-transit. Demand since Period 24 has stabilized at ~69 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for this belt SKU has stabilized following the May/June peak. The average demand from Period 24 to 30 is 73.1 units, which aligns with the documented post-peak stabilization. However, there is a significant logistics crisis: no arrivals have occurred since Period 19 despite several orders placed in May/June (Periods 13, 14, 18). Specifically, the Period 1 order (39 units) is confirmed lost, and several subsequent orders (Totaling 265 effective units) are currently undelivered and well past the promised lead time of 2 periods. The backend OR engine sees a massive pipeline of 304 units (265 effective + 39 lost) and will likely target zero orders if not adjusted. To force the OR engine to place a recovery order despite the 'in-transit' phantom inventory, I am setting 'L' to an explicit value of 6. This increases the base stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302 is scaled by 1+L), which helps overcome the pipeline inflation. I'm using a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~73) while filtering out the earlier seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged logistics failure: No arrivals observed for 11 consecutive periods (P20-P30). Effective pipeline (265 units) is likely lost or significantly delayed. Base stock parameters adjusted to trigger recovery ordering.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019): We are in a state of severe logistical failure with no arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (since P19). The 'In-transit' quantity of 410 units contains the original 39 (P1) lost units, the 265 units from the May/June stalled pipeline, and the 106 units ordered last period (P31). Total effective pipeline is considered unreliable. Demand has unexpectedly surged again, with P30 and P31 reaching 98 and 102 units respectively (avg 100), compared to the earlier August mean of 69. This suggests a new early Autumn demand spike. Given that the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' to subtract from base stock, and the backend has no concept of 'lost' units, I must use 'explicit' methods to force a reorder by providing a target 'base_stock' that exceeds the inflated pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 650 and sigma_hat to 150 creates a base stock around ~850-900 units, which, when the 410 in-transit units are subtracted, should trigger a meaningful order of roughly 400-500 units to cover localized demand and hedge against further transit losses. I am setting L to explicit value 5 to reflect the extreme observed delays and increase the target stock level.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged logistics failure: No arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (P20-P31). New demand surge detected in Sept (P30-P31 avg = 100), up from P24-P29 avg of 69.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics freeze has finally broken. The order from Period 31 (106 units) arrived in Period 32 (actual lead time = 1). This confirms that new orders are moving, while the 265 units from orders placed significantly earlier (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) are effectively lost or permanently stalled. Current demand is in a high-demand regime, with the average of the last three periods (P30-P32) at 97.3 units. I am setting L to 1 based on the most recent delivery. To account for the lost pipeline and ensure the OR engine triggers necessary replenishment for the current demand surge, I am using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*98 to reflect the 2-period demand window at the current rate. sigma_hat is set to 15 to provide a buffer against the high variability seen in the September surge.

Carry-over insight: Logistics freeze ended at Period 32: P31 order arrived in 1 period, whereas 265 units from P1-P18 remain missing and should be treated as lost. New demand regime confirmed for September: average demand is 97.3 units (P30-P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The logistics freeze that held 265 units in-transit for 12+ periods has partially broken, but the status of those specific units remains uncertain; they are still treated as lost. A significant demand spike occurred in Period 33 (167 units), which is likely a late-September surge or seasonal shift. This is substantially higher than the 97.3 average observed in the preceding three periods. Current in-transit (514 units) includes 210 units from Period 32 and remnants of the 'lost' pool. With on-hand at 0 and a new demand peak, I need to increase the base stock calculation to cover the (L+1) period demand. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the recent spike and setting lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the recently observed 1-period arrival (though the promise is 2).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge detected in late September: Period 33 demand reached 167 units, a 70% increase over the previous three-week average of 97.3.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516859008' is currently experiencing a significant demand surge in late September and October (Period 33: 167 units, Period 34: 123 units). The current average demand for this autumn peak (P33-P34) is 145 units per period. Regarding logistics, while there was a massive freeze from Period 20 to Period 31, the arrival in Period 32 (order from P31) suggests that newer orders are navigating the supply chain with a lead time of 1-2 periods. However, there are 265 units from orders placed before Period 20 (specifically P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) that are effectively lost. The current in-transit total is 514 units. Subtracting the 265 lost units leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 249 units (the P32 order of 210 units plus some residual earlier units). With a lead time estimate of 2, the pipeline needs to cover three periods of demand (approx 435 units). Since 249 < 435, further ordering is necessary. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the recent return to one-period arrivals while being conservative with a 2-period promise, and use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the immediate high-demand surge (145 units/period) for both mu and sigma calculation.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Average demand for late September/early October (P33-P34) is 145 units/period, a ~50% increase over the September average.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (Period 36), following a confirmed Autumn demand surge in September (P33-P34 avg 145). However, Period 35 demand (77) showed a significant drop, suggesting either high volatility or a potential transition out of the peak surge. The logistics freeze (P20-P30) ended at P32, but lead times are unstable (P31 took 1 period, P32 took 3 periods). 265 units from orders placed before P19 are still considered lost and do not contribute to available inventory. Excluding these from the pipeline (314 total in-transit - 265 lost = 49 effective in-transit), and considering the current on-hand of 133, the total effective inventory is 182 units. Given the recent demand drop, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for demand to balance the surge with the latest cooling, and set lead time to 2 (calculated average recently) to account for the ongoing volatility.

Carry-over insight: October demand cooling: Period 35 demand (77) is ~47% lower than the late September peak (avg 145), suggesting the Autumn surge may be ending or stabilizing.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits seasonal demand spikes (May and late Sept/early Oct) followed by stabilization. Recent demand (P35-P36) averaged 92 units, down from the peak of 167 in P33 but consistent with the broad Autumn trend. Lead times are highly volatile: P31 arrived in 1 period, P32 in 3 periods, and P35 in 1 period. Given this oscillation, I am using a conservative lead time estimate (L=2) to protect against delays. The pipeline inventory (353 units) contains 265 units from orders prior to P19 that have not arrived for over 15 periods; according to carry-over insights, these are considered lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values that reflect the current demand regime (~95 units/period) without relying on the automated pipeline deduction which would be skewed by the lost units. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*95 and sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L)*25 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: October demand stabilization: Post-Sept peak demand has settled at an average of 92 units (P35-P36). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting an average operational lead time of 2.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand spiked to 153 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization average of 92 units. This suggests a potential late-October/Halloween surge or a new autumn regime. The latest three samples (P35-P37) show demand of 77, 107, and 153, indicating an upward trend. Lead times remain volatile (P32 took 3 periods, P35 took 1 period), so I'll maintain a conservative L=2 for the OR engine. The in-transit inventory is 353 units, but 265 of these (from orders prior to Period 19) are considered lost based on previous carry-over insights. To ensure the backend doesn't under-order due to 'phantom' pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high demand regime (mean of last 3 periods is 112.3) and use sigma_hat to cover the high volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in late October: Period 37 demand (153) is 66% higher than the P35-P36 average (92). Potential late Autumn surge detected.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant seasonality, likely linked to the accessories and belt category. Recent demand in October/early November shows high volatility (P37: 153, P38: 94) following an autumn surge in September. The last 4 periods average ~108 units. Lead times are highly variable: P31 took 1, P32 took 3, and P35 took 1. A cautious lead time estimate of L=2 is appropriate given this inconsistency. The pipeline inventory (440 units) includes 265 units from orders placed before Period 20 that are confirmed lost/stalled, as they haven't arrived in over 20 periods despite other newer orders arriving. The actual functional in-transit inventory is only 136 units (P36: 49, P38: 87). I am setting mu_hat to 324 (108 * (2+1)) and sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the recent demand volatility (153 vs 94) and to trigger ordering that compensates for the missing 265 units in the OR backend's pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline discrepancy: 265 units from P1-P18 remain stalled/lost after 20+ periods. Functional pipeline is Total In-transit minus 265. Demand remains in a high-volatility Autumn regime averaging ~108 units/period (P35-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40 (Nov 11), we are entering the peak retail season (Singles' Day, Black Friday, and lead-up to December). Demand has been volatile but high, with an average of 109 units over the last 5 periods (P35-P39). The logistics situation remains complex: out of 456 units in-transit, 265 units (orders from P1-P18) have not arrived for over 20 periods and are considered lost. The functional pipeline is 191 units (P38 order of 87 and P39 order of 65, plus the P40 order). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will use an explicit L=2 to reflect the average operational reality. Given the upcoming seasonal peak and recent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P35-P39) to capture the current high-demand regime (~109/week), ensuring the base stock level (target pipeline) is sufficient to cover these expected sales plus safety stock for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-November seasonal demand shift: Average demand for P35-P39 is 105.4 units, with high volatility (range 77-153). Functional lead-time is averaging 2 periods (calculated across P31-P36 arrivals).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the demand is in a high-volatility Autumn regime. The average demand from P35-P40 is approximately 105.8 units, within a range of 77 to 153. Given the date, the system must prepare for potential late-November (Black Friday) and December holiday demand spikes. Pipeline management is critical: 265 units from orders prior to Period 19 are definitively lost and must be ignored. The functional in-transit inventory is 456 - 265 = 191 units (comprised of orders from P38 and P39). Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P31, P32, P35, P36) have been 1, 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat using the most recent 6 samples (P35-P40) to capture the current high-demand mean of ~106, and sigma_hat using the same window to account for the high variance (std ~26) observed in this season.

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline confirmed: 265 units from P1-P18 are lost/stalled indefinitely. Actual pipeline = Total In-transit - 265. Mid-November demand regime stabilized at ~106 units/period (P35-P40).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Demand has stabilized at a high level; the average for Period 35-41 is 105.9 units/period. The functional pipeline calculation is critical: of the 391 units in-transit, 265 units from orders placed prioritized to Period 18 are confirmed lost/stalled indefinitely (last arrival from that batch was Period 19). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 391 - 265 = 126 units. These 126 units consist of orders from Period 38 (87 units) and Period 40 (presumably 0, so Period 39/41 logic applies). Since On-hand is 0 and functional pipeline is 126, while the 2-period demand requirement (L=2) is approx 212 units, the system needs to trigger an order. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable Autumn regime (approx 106 units/period) while accounting for the high volatility observed in October/November. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as the recent arrivals (P31, P32, P35, P36, P39) show a mean revolving around the promised 2 periods (1, 3, 1, 3, 2).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early December (Period 43). Historical demand for this belt SKU showed a peak in May (~96) and has been in a high-volatility Autumn/Winter regime since September, averaging 106.6 units over the last 8 periods (P35-P42). The most recent demand (P42) was 115. Calendar-wise, we are entering the peak holiday shopping season, where demand for accessories like belts often increases significantly. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this late-year surge, targeting a forecast of 120 units per period. Regarding inventory, the total In-transit is 391 units; however, 265 units from periods prior to Period 19 are effectively lost (stalled for 24+ periods). The functional pipeline is 126 units (391 - 265). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently, so I will use a calculated average for L. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the high volatility (range 77-153) observed in the current seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed functional pipeline: 265 units (ordered P1-P18) are lost/stalled indefinitely; actual pipeline = Total In-transit - 265. Retail peak season shift: Late Q4 demand (P35-P42) average is 106.6, up from August low of 69.2.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in the middle of the Q4 holiday peak season. Demand in Period 43 dropped significantly to 50 units, though the prior 8-period average (P35-P42) was much higher at 106.6. This drop could be a brief lull before a final pre-Christmas surge or the start of a post-peak decline. However, given the date (Dec 9), some high demand is still expected. A pipeline correction is critical: 265 units from orders placed in Period 1-18 are effectively lost (unreported for 25+ periods), meaning the functional pipeline is 158 units (423 total in-transit - 265 lost). Current on-hand is 0. Lead times have recently been fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2. I am setting L to 2. mu_hat is set using recent_N=9 to capture the Q4 trend (avg ~100) while tempering for the recent low. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=9 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Functional pipeline remains (Total In-Transit - 265). Demand in early December (P43) showed a sharp 50% drop compared to the mid-Nov average of 106, requiring monitoring to determine if this is a pre-holiday lull or a regime shift.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are in mid-December. Demand in the most recent periods (P43-P44) has averaged 66.5 units, which is a decline from the mid-November average of ~106. This suggests a post-Black Friday or pre-holiday shift. In-transit inventory stands at 423 units, but 265 of these (from orders P1-P18) have been confirmed lost for over 30 periods. The functional pipeline is therefore (423 - 265) = 158 units. These units come from Period 38 (87 units), Period 43 (32 units), and remaining balances. Historical lead times recently have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). I choose to use explicit methods to ensure the OR backend accounts for the lost 265 units: I set L=2 (promised/recent avg). For mu_hat, I use N=5 (P40-P44) which averages ~92.4; (1+L)*92.4 = 277.2. For sigma_hat, I calculate the standard deviation for the same period (approx 25) and scale by sqrt(3), resulting in ~43. This approach ensures we maintain stock for the holiday period without over-ordering based on ghost pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: December demand regime: Average demand for early Dec (P43-P44) is 66.5 units, a ~38% decrease from the Nov stabilization of 106. Functional lead-time confirmed around 2 periods across recent arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching Christmas/New Year. Demand in Period 45 spiked to 127 units, potentially reflecting last-minute holiday shopping. This contradicts the previous 'December lull' (P43-P44 average ~66.5) and suggests a late-season surge. Total in-transit is 391. However, 265 units from P1-P18 are stalled/lost (see Carry-over P5-P43). Additionally, P38 (87 units) is now 8 periods old and P39-P43 have either arrived or are newer; P38's 87 units are likely also lost. Functional pipeline = 391 - 265 (P1-P18) - 87 (P38) = 39 units. With functional on-hand at 0 and minimal functional pipeline, we are severely under-stocked for a demand regime clearly exceeding 100 units. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P39, P43) arrived in 2 periods, but volatility remains. Demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N=3 to capture the sudden December spike (avg 127, 83, 50 = ~87) while acknowledging the high-volatility peak of 127. Sigma_hat remains 'default' to handle the high variance observed in Q4.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Functional pipeline adjusted to exclude P38 (87 units) which are 8 periods old, alongside the original 265 units lost from P1-P18. Total functional loss = 352 units. Late December demand shift: demand surged to 127 (P45), up from the early Dec average of 66.5.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47 (Dec 30), we are at the end of the calendar year. Recent demand has surged again, with the last two periods (P45-P46) averaging 113.5 units, reversing the early December lull (avg 66.5). This indicates a strong holiday/New Year demand regime. Our functional pipeline remains severely compromised: out of 391 units in-transit, 265 units (P1-18) are permanently lost, and 87 units (P38) are now 9 periods overdue and must be considered lost. This leaves a functional in-transit of only 39 units (from recent periods). With 0 on-hand, we are in a stockout position. To trigger a recovery order that accounts for the current demand surge and the pipeline reality, I use an 'explicit' L=2 based on recent performance (P41, P43 each took 2 periods) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3 to capture the December surge). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen throughout Q4.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total functional pipeline loss is now 352 units (265 units from P1-P18 and 87 units from P38). December demand volatility confirmed: shifted from a lull (avg 66.5) to a late-month peak (avg 113.5).
