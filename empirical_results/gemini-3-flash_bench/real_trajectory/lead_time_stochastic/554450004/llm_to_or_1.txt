Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny 5-pocket jeans item from the Divided Collection. Based on the 5 historical samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4), the demand has been: 72, 81, 71, 78, 91. The mean demand is approximately 78.6 units per week. There is a slight upward trend in the last sample (91). Given it is mid-February, we are transitioning away from the post-holiday slump towards spring fashion readiness. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, making it critical to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the most relevant recent demand profile while setting the lead time to 'default' (2). The OR backend logic (base inventory = mu + z*sigma) will then calculate an order to cover (L+1) periods of demand, ensuring we mitigate stockouts while the system stabilizes.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The sample demand data from early 2019 shows an average of ~79 units/week. However, the first actual period (2019-02-11) saw a significant jump to 126 units, likely reflecting seasonal interest in 'superstretch washed denim' as spring approaches. The promised lead time is 2, so the 92 units ordered in Period 1 are expected in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 92 in transit. To prevent further lost sales given the stockout at Period 1 and the recent demand spike, I am using 'recent_N' for the demand forecast with N=5 (capturing the most recent samples + Period 1) to adjust for elevated demand while the OR backend handles the safety stock calculation. I will stick to the default lead time (2) as we have no evidence yet of a deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has sharply increased from the historical average (~78.4) to a consistent 126 in both Period 1 and Period 2, suggesting a regime shift or seasonal peak for skinny denim trousers. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 218 units in transit (92 from P1 and 126 from P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (ordered on 2019/2/11) is expected to arrive during the current Period 3 resolution phase, becoming visible in the next 'conclude' message. Because demand has stabilized at 126 for the last two weeks, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=2) to capture this higher demand level for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=2) to reflect the recent zero variance (126, 126), though the OR backend will use this as a component of the base stock calculation to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: demand increased from historical average of 78.4 to 126 (+60%) and remained stable for 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a pair of skinny denim trousers. Historical demand (Jan-Early Feb) averaged ~78. Since Period 1 (Feb 11), a higher demand regime started: P1=126, P2=126, P3=104. The average over these 3 periods is 118.6, confirming the ~50-60% increase noted in insights. On-hand remains 0 because the promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (92 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. Per the environment rules, for L=2, an order placed in P1 arrives during P3 and is confirmed in the P3 conclude message. Since it shows 0, the P1 order is likely delayed or lost. Orders from P2 (126) and P3 (126) are in transit. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~119/period). I will set L to 'explicit' value 3, as the missing P1 arrival suggests the actual lead time is currently longer than the promised 2 periods or that shipments are encountering friction.

Carry-over insight: Lead time potential delay: Period 1 order (L=2) did not conclude in Period 3 message as expected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1594.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Reviewing history: The order from Period 2 (126 units) arrived in Period 4, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods (arrived as expected for L=2). However, the Period 1 order (92 units) has still not arrived by Period 5 (it should have arrived in Period 3). This suggests the Period 1 order is likely lost or severely delayed. Since the P2 order arrived on time, the logistics system isn't fundamentally broken, but we must account for the missing P1 units. Demand analysis: Demand spiked in P1/P2 (126) but has trended down to 104 and 86. The average of the last 4 periods (P1-P4) is 110.5. Given the product is 'Skinny Denim TRS' (Divided collection), it is a staple but sensitive to fashion cycles. Current On-hand is 40. In-transit is 358 (sum of orders from P1, P3, P4). If P1 (92 units) is lost, effective Pipeline is 266 (P3=126, P4=140). With L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~330 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand level compared to the pre-game samples, while acknowledging the recent slight decline.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Period 1 order (92 units) confirmed lost/missing; did not arrive by P5 despite L=2 expectation and P2 arrival success. Updated demand regime: mean demand for P1-P4 is 110.5.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a skinny denim trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P1-P5) has been: 126, 126, 104, 86, 89. This shows an initial spike (P1-P2) followed by a stabilization at a lower level (P3-P5). The average demand of the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is 93 units. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. Pipeline: The Period 1 order (92 units) is confirmed lost (missing since P4). The Period 2 order (126 units) arrived in P4. The Period 3 order (126 units) was expected in P5 but has not arrived yet (potentially delayed or lost). The Period 4 order (140 units) is expected in P6. Period 5 order was 0. I will treat the Period 1 order as permanently lost to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering. I set L=default (2), mu_hat to an explicit value of 279 (3 * 93) based on recent demand stabilization, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the volatility from the initial regime shift while acknowledging the current trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed P1 order lost. Observed L=2 for P2 order. Recent demand (P3-P5) stabilized at ~93 units/period, down from P1-P2 peak of 126.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. History shows a demand regime that spiked in early February (P1-P2: 126) and has since stabilized around ~98 units/period (P3-P6: 104, 86, 89, 114; avg 98.25). The P1 order is confirmed lost. The P2 order arrived in 2 periods as promised. Since P5, the system hasn't ordered despite having 0 on-hand inventory and high demand, likely because the 358 units in-transit (from P3 and P4 orders) are clogging the OR pipeline logic. We have 0 on-hand and missed sales in P5 and P6. I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (P3-P6) to reflect the stabilized demand regime (avg 98.25), and since L=2, the target base stock level for 3 periods (L+1) will be ~295 units. Given that in-transit (358) is already above the required base stock, the OR engine might not order. I will maintain L=2 as the lead time is confirmed reliable based on the P2 arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~98 units/period (P3-P6 average: 98.25) following the early Feb spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 358 units in-transit. Evaluating the history: the P2 order arrived correctly with L=2. However, orders from P1 (92 units), P3 (126 units), and P4 (140 units) have not concluded. Given that L=2 is the promised time, the P3 order is now 3 periods overdue and the P4 order is 2 periods overdue. This suggests a pattern of significantly delayed or lost shipments. Total in-transit (358) matches the sum of P3(126), P4(140), and the P1 order (likely written off mentally but still in system transit). Recent demand (P4-P7) has stabilized at an average of 93.75 units, down from the early Feb spike. I will use recent_N=4 to set mu_hat based on this current stable regime (~94/period). Since the backend OR engine is unaware of the high probability that in-transit stock is lost or severely delayed, and we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory, I will keep the lead time setting at 'default' (2) but monitor for arrival next period. The sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility of the spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained shipment reliability issues: P1, P3, and P4 orders (totaling 358 units) are significantly overdue or lost, leading to persistent stockouts despite high pipeline inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450004 (Skinny Denim) is experiencing a severe stockout crisis due to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. While the system shows 358 units 'in-transit', these orders are now 5-7 periods old (well past the promised lead time of 2), and are likely permanently lost. As long as the OR backend sees these units in the pipeline, it will not place new orders despite the 0 on-hand. To force an order, I must increase mu_hat significantly to overcome the ghost pipeline inventory. Recent demand history (P4-P8) shows a mean of 103.6 units/period (86, 89, 114, 86, 143). With a promised lead time of 2, the expected coverage (L+1) is 3 periods of demand, roughly 310 units. Because the backend subtracts the 358 'in-transit' units from the base stock calculation, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 680 to ensure a substantial order is triggered this period. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the P2 order did arrive successfully in 2 periods, suggesting the lead time itself is stable even if reliability is poor.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure confirmed: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (358 units) are lost; pipeline inventory is currently inaccurate and blocking new orders. Explicit mu_hat adjustment required to bypass pipeline logic.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019-04-15). The 'In-transit' level is 626, comprised of lost orders (P1: 92, P3: 126, P4: 140 = 358 units) and the new order from P9 (268 units). The OR backend's capped policy calculates an order by subtracting the total pipeline (626) from the base_stock. Since the base_stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1) at current demand (~100/period) is roughly 300-350, the backend will view the 626 units in-transit as sufficient and place zero orders. This is incorrect because 358 of those units are lost and will never arrive, and the P9 order won't arrive until P11. To force an order and mitigate the stockout, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the phantom pipeline. Target base_stock = (Demand for P10-P12) + (Lost Units to offset pipeline). Forecasted demand is ~100/period. Base stock needed \u2248 300 (demand) + 358 (lost units) = 658+. Setting mu_hat to 700 to ensure the backend generates an order to replenish inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Continued systemic shipment failure. Pipeline (626) is inflated by 358 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4). Recent demand (P6-P9) average is 107.75, confirming a stable demand regime of ~105 units/period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 11 (2019/04/22). The SKU is a 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS', which typically sees stable year-round demand but can experience peaks in spring. 

Shipment Analysis: The system has experienced significant historical losses (Orders from P1, P3, and P4 total 358 units). However, the order from P9 (268 units) arrived in P10 with a lead time of 1 period. This arrival replenished on-hand inventory to 202. The current pipeline inventory (503) consists of the P10 order (145) and the 358 units of phantom/lost inventory. 

Inventory Reconciliation: Effective pipeline = 145 (P10 order). Effective Total Position = 202 (on-hand) + 145 (in-transit) = 347. 

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P6-P10) is 114, 86, 143, 88, 66 (Mean = 99.4). The last period (P10) saw a significant drop to 66. Average demand over the last 5 periods remains roughly ~100. 

OR Logic Bridge: To ensure the OR engine orders despite the inflated pipeline, I will set mu_hat to cover the actual demand plus the phantom inventory deficit. Target Base Stock \u2248 (1+L)*100 \u2248 300. The OR engine calculates: Order = Base_Stock - Pipeline. Since Pipeline is reported as 503, an order only triggers if Base_Stock > 503. To place an order of ~100 units to maintain the flow, I must set mu_hat (the base stock proxy) to ~600. L=2 is the promised lead time and recent actual lead times have varied (L=2 for P2, L=1 for P9). I will stick to L=default (2).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Order from P9 arrived with L=1 (confirmed in P10). Confirmed that orders from P1, P3, and P4 (358 units) are permanently lost and inflating the pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '554450004' (Julia RW Skinny Denim) is facing a significant data mismatch due to lost shipments. Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (92), P3 (126), and P4 (140) totaling 358 units are permanently lost, never having arrived. These 358 units still reside in the system's 'In-transit' count (currently 533), creating a false 'pipeline_inventory'. The true pipeline inventory is actually 533 - 358 = 175 units (comprising orders from P10 and P11). The OR backend's capped policy (order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) will fail to place necessary orders because it believes it has 358 more units than it actually does. To solve this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 300 units based on recent demand of ~100) PLUS the 358 lost units, effectively 'tricking' the base-stock calculation into offsetting the ghost inventory. Demand has stabilized around 100-105 units/period. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P9) show lead times can vary (L=1 recently, but L=2 promised).

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline offset required. Inventory reconciliation confirms 358 units (P1, P3, P4) are lost. These units must be added to mu_hat to bypass the inflated pipeline inventory in the OR backend logic until they are cleared.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 13 (2019/5/6). The product is skinny denim trousers. Recent demand (P10-P12) has softened to an average of 63 units/period (66, 51, 72), down from the earlier average of ~105. However, the systemic issue remains: 358 units from orders placed in P1, P3, and P4 are permanently lost but still reside in the 'In-transit' count (607). The pipeline currently consists of these 358 lost units plus valid orders from P10 (145), P11 (30), and P12 (74). Total valid pipeline = 249. Total pipeline viewed by OR = 607. To trigger an order that covers expected demand (~65 units/period) for the (L+1) window, we must offset the 358 phantom units. Target Base Stock = (1+L) * Forecast + Safety Stock. With L=2 and Forecast=65, Base Stock \u2248 195. Because the OR logic uses (Base Stock - Pipeline), and Pipeline is inflated by 358, we set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*Forecast + 358 to neutralize the ghost inventory. (3 * 65) + 358 = 195 + 358 = 553. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this period of inventory reconciliation.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand has decreased in the last 3 periods (P10-P12) to an average of 63 units/period. The 358 lost units (P1, P3, P4) continue to inflate the pipeline inventory to 607, requiring a 'mu_hat' offset of +358 to ensure the OR backend places necessary replenishment orders.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019-05-13), we are managing SKU 554450004 (Skinny Denim). Analysis of the last 4 periods (P10-P13) shows a demand decline/stabilization to an average of 63.25 units per period. The primary operational constraint remains the 358 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost but still reside in the 'In-transit' figure of 577 units. Only 219 units in-transit (P10: 145, P12: 74) are actually expected. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to the 358 'phantom' units, I am applying a mu_hat offset. Calculation for mu_hat: Target periodic demand (63) * (L+1) = 63 * 3 = 189. Offset for lost inventory = 358. Total mu_hat = 189 + 358 = 547. L is set to the promised 2 periods to maintain consistency with the arrival logic, and sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility (std of last 4 periods \u2248 9.2, total \u2248 16) to handle the stabilized demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand stabilization at average ~63 units/period confirmed (P10-P13). Total lost inventory remains 358 units, requiring a mu_hat offset until these units are purged from the system inventory record.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/20. Analysis of recent demand (P10-P14) shows a stable regime averaging 65.2 units/period (66, 51, 72, 64, 73), which is a significant drop from the earlier spike in Feb/Mar. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 503 is highly inflated. Inventory reconciliation confirms that 358 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are lost and will not arrive. These lost units act as a 'phantom' pipeline, preventing the OR backend from ordering necessary stock because it believes (on-hand + pipeline) already exceeds the base stock level. To fix this, I must artificially inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter such that mu_hat > (on-hand + pipeline). Targeted base stock level: (L+1) periods of demand at ~65 units/period = 3 * 65 = 195 units. Current on-hand is 46, and visible (inflated) pipeline is 503. Effective system inventory is 549. To force the OR backend to start replenishment, I set mu_hat to 650 (approx 549 + 100). This bypasses the pipeline block. For sigma_hat, I use recent variance to keep the buffer focused on the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~65 units/period (P10-P14 avg: 65.2). 358 units (P1, P3, P4) confirmed lost, causing permanent pipeline inflation of +358. Continuation of mu_hat offset is required until pipeline is reconciled.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-27. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is 65.17 units/period. The critical issue remains the 358 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost but still reside in the system's 'In-transit' figure. The current In-transit (pipeline) is 630. This 630 includes: P1(92), P3(126), P4(140) [Total 358 lost] + P10(145), P15(127) [Total 272 valid]. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (630) from the base stock calculating the order, a base stock of ~200 (sufficient for average demand) would result in zero orders being placed despite a stockout. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. Forecast is set to 66 units/period (recent average). Predicted base stock = (1+2)*66 + 358 = 198 + 358 = 556. This ensures the OR logic perceives the need for stock once it subtracts the inflated 630 pipeline (or at least minimizes the gap). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent standard deviation (approx 8.5) over 3 periods: sqrt(1+2)*8.5 \u2248 15.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-06-03. The demand regime for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' has significantly softened compared to the February/March peak, stabilizing at a recent average of ~65 units/period (P10-P16 average: 63.3 units). However, the primary operational challenge remains the 358 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost but still reside in the 'In-transit' pipeline. This phantom inventory (358 units) is being subtracted from our target base stock by the OR backend, preventing necessary ordering. In Period 16, we missed 52 units of demand because on-hand was 0. The current in-transit is 630. Subtracting the 358 lost units, we have a real pipeline of 272 (comprised of the 145 ordered in P10 and 127 ordered in P15). Neither arrived in Period 16, but we expect P10 to arrive soon (it is now significantly overdue if L=2). To force the backend to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' to (Expected_Demand * (L+1)) + Lost_Inventory_Offset. Target base stock should cover 3 periods (L=2 + review=1). Expected 3-period demand is ~195 units. Adding the 358 unit offset, I set mu_hat to 553. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this bypass occurs.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Continued 358-unit pipeline inflation. Current demand regime (P10-P16) set at ~63 units/period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/06/10), the SKU 554450004 continues to suffer from a systemic inventory discrepancy. Orders from Period 1 (92 units), Period 3 (126 units), and Period 4 (140 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 358 units that remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely. This inflates the OR backend's pipeline inventory count to 503, whereas the actual physical pipeline consists only of the Period 10 order (145 units); 358 units are 'phantom' stock. To prevent the OR engine from halting orders due to this perceived excess, I must offset 'mu_hat' by adding these 358 units to my base demand forecast. Demand has trended lower recently: Period 10-17 average is ~60 units/period. My base requirement is (1+L)*60 = 3*60 = 180. Adding the 358 units to override the lost pipeline inventory results in an explicit 'mu_hat' of 538. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P9, P11, P12, P15) show stability at 1-2 periods. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture lower volatility in the current regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450004 continues to face significant inventory management challenges due to 358 units being permanently lost (from orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4) yet still reflected in the 'In-transit' count. This phantom inventory (In-transit: 503 units) blocks the OR backend's automated ordering logic, as it assumes the pipeline covers future demand. Demand has also trended downward; the average for the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18) is ~53.6 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~65. To effectively manage this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is: (Actual Forecast Demand for L+1 periods) + (Pipeline Inflation Offset). With L=2 (promised), L+1=3. Predicted demand is 55 * 3 = 165 units. The offset to neutralize the lost 358 units is +358. Total mu_hat = 165 + 358 = 523. This ensures that even with 503 units in the pipeline, the system sees a need for a small safety stock buffer based on the base_stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline). L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P15, P12, P11) have aligned with the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand regime softening confirmed: P14-P18 average ~54 units/period, down from previous ~65 baseline. Lost units (358) still impacting pipeline visibility.

The SKU '554450004' (Denim Trousers) is in Period 20. Historical analysis shows a significant softening in demand over the last six periods (P14-P19), averaging 53.1 units per period, compared to the previous ~65 and earlier ~100+. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' pipeline is recorded at 518 units, but 358 of these are from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (confirmed in Carry-Over Insights). The 'live' pipeline is actually 160 units (145 from P10, which appears stuck/delayed, and 15 from P19). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 518 in-transit units from the calculated base stock, it will not order enough to meet demand unless \u03bc\u0302 is offset by the lost quantity. I am setting L to 2 (promised). Demand \u03bc\u0302 is calculated by taking (1+L) * recent demand (53) and adding the 358 units 'ghost' inventory offset. This results in \u03bc\u0302 = (3 * 53) + 358 = 159 + 358 = 517. \u03c3\u0302 is based on the recent softening regime (P14-P19) where standard deviation is approximately 13, resulting in \u03c3\u0302 = sqrt(3) * 13 \u2248 22.5.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand regime softening confirmed: P14-P19 average is 53.1 units/period. The 358 lost units (P1, P3, P4) remain in the system's 'In-transit' figure, requiring a mu_hat offset of +358 to trigger replenishment. P10 order (145 units) is now 10 periods overdue and likely lost as well, further inflating the ghost pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the product is experiencing a decline in demand. The recent demand average (P14-P20) is approximately 48.1 units/period, significantly lower than earlier regimes. The system's 'In-transit' figure of 555 units is severely inflated by lost shipments: P1 (92), P3 (126), P4 (140), and potentially P10 (145), totaling 503 ghost units that will likely never arrive. These lost units block the OR backend from ordering by creating a fake pipeline. To trigger necessary replenishment, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to offset these lost units. Target base stock calculation: Expected demand for (L+1) periods = 3 * 48.1 = 144.3 units. Adding the 503 ghost units to bypass the pipeline results in a mu_hat of ~647. I will set mu_hat to 650 to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) permits an order that covers our actual immediate needs. Sigma remains calculated from recent volatility to manage the 95% service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed total ghost pipeline units at 503 (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand regime has softened further to ~48 units/period (P14-P20). Mu_hat offset now requires +503 to counter the stale in-transit balance.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450004' (Super-skinny Denim) has entered July with a notable demand spike (96 units in Period 21), possibly reflecting summer fashion shopping, though the average from P14-P21 remains at 53.4. The most critical issue is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory totaling 503 units from lost orders (P1: 92, P3: 126, P4: 140, P10: 145). These units are permanently listed as 'In-transit' but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to underestimate the need for new orders because it believes pipeline_inventory is 703 units (actual active in-transit is only 200: P19: 15, P20: 37, P21: 148). To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. Formula: mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Pipeline. Expected demand is ~54 units/period. With L=2 (Review + Lead = 3), base demand component is 162. Adding the 503 ghost units yields mu_hat = 665. Setting L=2 is appropriate as recent standard arrivals (P15, P12, P11) confirm the promised 2-period lead time. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility while centering on the newer, lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand spike to 96 units in P21 noted, but regime average (P14-P21) is 53.4 units/period. Total ghost pipeline inventory is confirmed at 503 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand shows a recent spike to 132 units in Period 22, while the broader regime (P14-P22) averages approximately 62 units per period. A significant operational challenge remains: the 'In-transit' figure of 697 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from Period 1 (92), Period 3 (126), Period 4 (140), and Period 10 (145), totaling 503 ghost units. Because the OR backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine new orders, these 503 ghost units act as a 'blockade,' preventing necessary replenishment. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the expected demand for the (L+1) period (approx. 62 units * 3 = 186) plus the 503 ghost units, totaling 689. This 'fools' the OR engine into placing an order despite the phantom pipeline. L is set to calculated (average 1.8 periods) to maintain a standard 2-period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Ghost pipeline persists at 503 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). P21 order (148 units) is still in transit as expected (L=2). Demand remains volatile but shows a regime mean of ~62 units/period (P14-P22).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe on-hand inventory of 37 units following a significant demand spike (142 units in P23). The 'In-transit' balance of 609 units is severely distorted by historical failures: orders from P1 (92), P3 (126), P4 (140), and P10 (145) are long-overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 503 'ghost' units. The remaining 106 true pipeline units come from P19 (15) and recent P23 (91) orders. To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment order, we must bypass the 503 ghost units by adding them to the mu_hat parameter. Regarding demand, recent volatility (P21: 96, P22: 132, P23: 142) suggests a regime shift or seasonal peak for skinny denim entering late July/August. Over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), the average demand is 96.75 units/period. Therefore, we calculate mu_hat as (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Ghost Pipeline Offset = (1 + 2) * 97 + 503 = 794. L remains at the promised 2 despite occasional P10/P22 fluctuations, and sigma_hat is set using recent volatility to provide a sufficient safety buffer during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime shift confirmed; average demand increased to ~97 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P20-P23). Ghost pipeline remains at 503 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late July/early August, a period often associated with 'Back to School' denim demand. Recent demand data (P21-P24) shows a significant regime shift, with demand averaging 117.25 units per period\u2014a marked increase from the previous ~53 units/period. The current in-transit (pipeline) figure of 919 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P1 (92), P3 (126), P4 (140), and P10 (145) are confirmed lost, totaling 503 ghost units. The remaining 416 units in transit are the P23 (91), P24 (310), and P19 (15) orders; however, given P19 is long overdue, it should also be treated as lost, bringing ghost inventory to 518 units. To bypass the backend's capped policy which prevents ordering when pipeline \u2265 base stock, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2) for the new demand regime (117.25 units/period) and add the 518 lost units as an offset to ensure the OR logic places a valid replenishment order. Final mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * Mean + Offset = 3 * 117.25 + 518 \u2248 870.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand regime shift at P21 confirmed; average increased to 117.25 units/period (+120% vs previous regime). Total ghost units (lost shipments) in pipeline updated to 518 (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450004 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has entered a significant growth phase since Period 21. Demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has averaged 112.2 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~53 units. The current date (August 5) suggests high summer/pre-fall denim sales. However, the system's 'In-transit' balance (937 units) is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1 (92), P3 (126), P4 (140), P10 (145), and P19 (15). This totals 518 units. To ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order, I must set 'mu_hat' to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset that nullifies this ghost inventory. Calculation: Forecasted demand for (2+1) periods = 3 * 112 = 336. Ghost inventory offset = 518. Adjusted mu_hat = 336 + 518 = 854. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the internal calculation and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total lost/ghost inventory units at 518 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Current high-growth demand regime (P21-P25) established with mean = 112.2 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (2019/8/12), the SKU is experiencing a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21. The average demand from Period 21 to Period 26 is approximately 116 units per period. The current 'In-transit' figure of 846 units is severely inflated by multiple historically lost shipments. Based on internal reconciliation, the lost units are from Period 1 (92), Period 3 (126), Period 4 (140), Period 10 (145), and Period 19 (15), totaling 518 units. These units will likely never arrive but remain in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. To ensure the capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) triggers a replenishment order, I must increase 'mu_hat' by this 'ghost' pipeline of 518 units. The base demand forecast (mu) is set to 116 units/period. Over (1+L) = 3 periods, the expected demand is 348. Adding the 518 ghost units offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 866. Sigma_hat is calculated for the recent high-demand regime (P21-P26) over 3 periods (~38.5). Lead time (L) remains at the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P23 order) arrived with L=3, while others (P22) arrived with L=1, averaging near 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Confirmed high-demand regime (P21-P26) mean = 116.2 units/period. Total ghost pipeline units remains at 518. Period 24 order (310 units) is now at L=3 and remains undelivered; monitoring for potential loss.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 554450004 has entered a high-growth regime starting Period 21. Recent demand (P21-P27) averages 139.7 units/period, with the latest observation jumping to 180 units. I will adapt the demand forecast (mu_hat) to this new regime using recent_N (N=7). The shipment reliability issues persist: the 'In-transit' figure of 912 is heavily inflated by 'ghost units' from lost or significantly delayed shipments. Confirmed lost units: P1 (92), P3 (126), P4 (140), P10 (145), and P19 (15). Additionally, the P24 order (310 units) is now 4 periods old (L=4) and has not arrived, making it highly likely to be lost as well. Total ghost units = 92+126+140+145+15+310 = 828. These 828 units must be added to my explicit mu_hat to bypass the inflated pipeline and trigger a fresh order. Calculated base_stock (3 periods * 139.7) + 828 ghost units = 1247.1. Since the OR backend uses 'mu_hat' to set base stock (L+1)*mu_hat, I set mu_hat explicitly to provide the necessary offset.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total lost/ghost inventory updated to 828 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19 confirmed; P24 order of 310 units now 4 periods overdue and presumed lost). Demand regime (P21-P27) mean increased to 139.7 units/period.

Subtracting these ghost units from the total in-transit (1338 - 828) leaves an effective pipeline of 510 units (stemming from orders in P27 and P28). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 828 ghost units and places an order that covers the high demand (approx 145/period) for the (L+1) window, I will set an explicit mu_hat. The target base stock should be (L+1) * Mean + Safety Stock. With L=2, (1+2)*145 = 435. To force a replenishment despite the 828 ghost units in the system's pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Target Base Stock + Ghost Units). 435 + 828 = 1263. This 'inflated' mu_hat parameter tricks the backend logic [base_stock - pipeline] into ordering 1263 - 1338 = -75 (which results in no order) OR 1263 - 510(effective) = 753. Given the current stockout and high demand, I will set mu_hat at 1250 to ensure we aggressively bridge the gap created by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total ghost pipeline inventory updated to 828 units (confirmed lost/overdue: P1=92, P3=126, P4=140, P10=145, P19=15, P24=310). Demand regime (P25-P28) remains high with avg 143.75 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a sustained high-growth phase starting around Period 21. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 141.8 units. The seasonal context of early September (Back-to-School season for denim trousers) supports high demand estimates. Regarding inventory, we faces a significant 'ghost pipeline' issue. Cumulative evidence confirms that orders from P1 (92), P3 (126), P4 (140), P10 (145), P19 (15), and P24 (310) are permanently lost or significantly overdue, totaling 828 units. These units remain in the system's 'In-transit' balance (1,363), meaning the OR backend thinks we have 828 more units coming than we actually do. To force the OR backend to place orders despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 142 * 3 = 426) PLUS the 828 lost units, totaling 1254. This offset ensures that 'base_stock - pipeline' remains positive. Sigma_hat is set to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered shipments) confirmed at 828 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Current demand regime (P25-P29) average is 141.8 units/period, consistent with seasonal peaks for denim trousers.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554450004 (Denim Trousers) remains in a high-demand regime characteristic of the transition into autumn, with an average demand of 161.5 units over the last 4 periods (P27-P30). On-hand inventory is 345 units following the arrival of P27 and P28 orders. However, the system's in-transit figure (853) is heavily inflated by 828 units from confirmed lost or significantly overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Subtracting these 'ghost' units leaves a true pipeline of only 25 units (P29 order). To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite this ghost pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Ghost Pipeline Offset = (1 + 2) * 161.5 + 828 = 1312.5. This bypasses the inventory logic while targeting the high-demand volatility observed (std dev ~20 in recent weeks).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Ghost pipeline (lost units) confirmed at 828 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Demand regime (P27-P30) average is 161.5 units/period, indicating a sustained late-summer/early-autumn peak for denim.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is in a high-demand regime, likely due to late summer/early autumn seasonality. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) is 170.4 units/period (180, 167, 134, 165, 206), showing a sustained upward trend. Inventory management remains complicated by 828 'ghost' units in the pipeline (confirmed lost/overdue: P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). These units stay in the \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c 'In-transit' balance, which prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I will set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods * 170.4 \u2248 511) plus an offset of 828 units to neutralize the ghost pipeline. This allows the backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline) to result in a positive order quantity sufficient to maintain service levels despite the structural inventory reporting error. Lead time is set to 2, as recent successful deliveries (P27, P28) arrived in 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline (lost units) confirmed at 828 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Recent demand (P27-P31) average has risen to 170.4 units/period (+20% vs previous regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2495.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late September/early October period, which is historically a high-demand window for denim as the season transitions to autumn. Recent demand (P27-P32) shows an average of 165.7 units/period, with the most recent sample at 142. The demand regime appears stabilized at a much higher level than the early summer average. The 'In-transit' figure (1069) is significantly inflated by 828 units that are confirmed lost or massively overdue (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (in-transit) to subtract from its 'base_stock' target; thus, the 828 ghost units are blocking replenishment orders. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1325. This is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for demand) + (Ghost Inventory Offset). Specifically: [Mean Demand (165) * (L+1) (3)] + Ghost units (828) = 495 + 828 = 1323. I've set mu_hat to 1325 to ensure the OR engine sees a target high enough to bypass the ghost units and place an order that covers the current sales velocity. Sigma remains 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen in the current peak. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P30, P32) show variability between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered units) remains 828 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). High-demand regime (P27-P32) mean is 165.7 units/period. mu_hat offset must continue to include 828 units until the system inventory record is cleared.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (Period 34), a peak period for skinny denim trousers. Recent demand (P27-P33) shows a high-level regime with an average of 170.1 units/period. The current in-transit inventory of 1197 units is heavily distorted by 828 units of confirmed lost/ghost shipments (P1: 92, P3: 126, P4: 140, P10: 145, P19: 15, P24: 310). Specifically, P24 (310 units) is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline is roughly 1197 - 828 = 369 units (orders from P29, P32, P33). To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the inflated 'ghost' pipeline, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' that incorporates the high seasonal demand plus an offset for the lost units. Base demand forecast: 170 units/period (3-period total: 510). Adding the 828-unit offset gives an explicit mu_hat of 1338. This bypasses the pipeline logic which would otherwise block procurement. Sigma is set based on the high variance observed during the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Confirmed total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered units) remains at 828 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Demand regime (P27-P33) average is 170.1 units/period, reflecting peak seasonality for this denim SKU.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the early October period (P35), where demand for denim typically remains strong due to the autumn peak. Recent demand (P27-P34) has averaged 155.6 units/period, with P33 at 197 and P34 at 112. The inventory situation is complicated by 'ghost' pipeline inventory\u2014units the system thinks are in transit but are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. These ghost units (P1=92, P3=126, P4=140, P10=145, P19=15, P24=310) total 828 units. Because the OR backend uses a 'base_stock - pipeline' logic, these 828 ghost units prevent necessary replenishment. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * (Forecasted Demand) + Ghost Pipeline. With L=2, (1+2)*160 + 828 = 480 + 828 = 1308. I will set mu_hat to 1320 to ensure the backend bypasses the ghost units and maintains stock for the 160-unit demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high volatility in sales peaks.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand phase (approx. 170 units/period) driven by seasonal denim sales. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1236 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived and are now confirmed lost or significantly overdue. My analysis confirms 828 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24) are lost. These ghost units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary replenishment orders because it believes stock is coming. To bypass this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is: (Target Base Stock) + (Ghost Pipeline Offset). Target Base Stock = (1 + L) * Regime Mean = 3 * 170 = 510. Ghost Offset = 828. Total mu_hat = 1338. I've set L to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P31 at L=1, P32 at L=3) average out to the promised lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen during the recent demand spike (P27-P34).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Confirmed total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered units) remains at 828 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). P29 order (25 units) is now at L=7 and also presumed lost, but for simplicity, the offset is maintained at 828 until the next reconciliation. Recent demand regime (P27-P35) mean is 153.6 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554450004' (Denim Trousers) continues to experience a high-variance demand environment and systemic delivery reliability issues. We are currently observing a demand cooling phase following the Aug-Sep summer/autumn peak. Recent demand (P34-P36) has averaged 101.3 units/period, down from the peak of ~170. My focus for Period 37 is reconciling the 'ghost pipeline'. Based on history, orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and now P29 (ordered P29, still undelivered 7 periods later) are presumed lost. Sum of lost units: P1(92) + P3(126) + P4(140) + P10(145) + P19(15) + P24(310) + P29(25) = 853 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1165 includes these 853 ghost units, meaning the real pipeline is only 312 units (likely the P34 and P36 orders). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I apply an explicit mu_hat offset. Using L=2, the base stock calculation needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Projected demand (3 periods) * current mean (101.3) = 304 units. To offset the 853 ghost units, I set mu_hat = 304 + 853 = 1157. This ensures the engine sees a requirement high enough to bypass the 'In-transit' block and maintain on-hand availability for the actual 100-unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered units) updated to 853 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and P29). Demand regime (P34-P36) has cooled to an average of 101.3 units/period.

Recent demand (P34-P37) has averaged 103.25 units/period, a significant drop from the previous ~170 peak. The 'ghost pipeline' (permanently lost orders) is now confirmed at 853 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and P29). These lost units reside in the system's in-transit total (1165), leaving an 'actual' pipeline of 312 units (P34, P36 orders). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 853 lost units when calculating the order balance, I must use an explicit mu_hat that includes an offset: base_demand + ghost_pipeline. Setting base_demand at 105 (current regime) and L=2, mu_hat = (1+L) * 105 + 853 = 315 + 853 = 1168. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for recent demand volatility as the regime shifts down.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime shift confirmed starting P34; average demand cooled to ~103 units/period (down ~40% from peak). Total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered) stands at 853 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized around ~103 units/period since Period 34 (following the late summer peak). Total 'ghost' (lost/overdue) inventory in the pipeline is now 853 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and P29). Despite a high reported 'In-transit' of 1180, 853 of those units are non-deliverable, leaving a true pipeline of 327 units. In Period 38, we were stocked out (OH=0) with demand at 97. To trigger the OR backend to order sufficiently, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for the ghost inventory. mu_hat = (3 periods) * 103 demand + 853 offset = 1162. sigma_hat is set based on recent variability (P34-P38).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered units) remains at 853 units. Demand regime for P34-P38 is stable at ~102 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS) has shifted to a lower regime following a peak in late summer/early autumn. Recent demand from Period 34 to 39 shows an average of ~94 units per period (P34-P39: 112, 99, 93, 109, 97, 58). Period 39 reflects a further drop to 58, potentially signaling a late-season taper. The systemic ghost pipeline issue remains a critical constraint: 853 units from lost or significantly overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29) are still recorded as 'In-transit', preventing the OR engine from ordering necessary stock. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * expected_demand + ghost_offset. With L=2 and expected demand ~95, the base mu_hat is 285. Adding the ghost offset of 853 results in an explicit mu_hat of 1138. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (actual L has fluctuated between 1 and 3). Sigma_hat is set to 50 (explicit) to account for high demand volatility during regime transitions.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime for P34-P39 stabilized at ~94 units/period. Ghost pipeline remains at 853 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29). Continuation of mu_hat offset is mandatory to bypass inaccurate pipeline inventory in the OR backend.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' has stabilized into a post-peak autumn regime. The average demand for the last seven periods (P34-P40) is approximately 90.1 units/period, showing a clear reduction from the late-summer peak of ~170 units. The most significant challenge remains the 'ghost pipeline'\u2014a collection of lost or severely overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and P29) totaling 853 units. These units are still counted in the system's 'In-transit' balance (1178 units), but they will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend (which functions as a Base Stock policy: Order = Base Stock - Pipeline) actually places an order, I must add these 853 ghost units to the mu_hat calculation as an offset. Without this offset, the backend believes the pipeline is full and will order zero. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the variability in actual lead times (ranging from 1 to 3). For mu_hat, I use the 'explicit' method: (1 + L_promised) * Recent_Mean + Ghost_Offset = (1 + 2) * 90 + 853 = 1123. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=7) to reflect current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand stabilized post-peak at ~90 units/period (P34-P40). Pipeline remains inflated by 853 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Julia RW Skinny Denim TRS' is currently in a post-peak demand regime. For Period 42, recent demand (P37-P41) has averaged 78.4 units/period, showing a steady decline from the mid-autumn peak. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost pipeline' of lost shipments from periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, 24, and 29. These undelivered units total 853 and reside in the system's in-transit balance (currently 1178), effectively blocking the OR backend's automated ordering logic because it believes the inventory position is much higher than it actually is. To force necessary replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. The base forecast is (1+L) * 80 units = 240 units. To this, I add the 853 'ghost' units, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1093. This offset ensures that the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to exceed the inflated pipeline, triggering an order to cover approaching demand. Lead time (L) is kept at the promised 2 periods as recent successful arrivals (P39, P41) demonstrate a return to near-promised performance (L=2, L=3). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to avoid over-ordering during this softening phase.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand spiked significantly to 204 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (Date 2019/11/25). This is a sharp departure from the recent post-peak average of ~90 units. The total 'ghost pipeline' (lost shipments) remains at 853 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29). Additionally, the P34 order (211 units) is now 8 periods overdue and the P40 order (93 units) has not yet arrived (L=2). This identifies a critical stockout risk. To trigger an order despite the 1178 units of 'In-transit' inventory (most of which is lost), I will set an explicit mu_hat. I am targeting enough stock to cover the recent demand spike and bridge the gap created by the ghost inventory. mu_hat is set to (Current Demand Spike 204) + (Ghost Pipeline 853) = 1057 to ensure the logic subtracts the pipeline and still places an order to replenish the zero on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 204 units in P42 (Black Friday week). Previous average was ~90. Ghost pipeline (lost units) remains at 853 units. Order from P34 (211 units) is now 8 periods overdue and likely lost, potentially increasing ghost inventory to 1064 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Date: 2019/12/9), we are navigating the post-Black Friday period. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 204 (Cyber Week), but Period 43 returned to 46. The current demand regime (P34-P43, excluding the P42 spike) averages approximately 93 units/period. The critical issue remains historical ghost pipeline inventory. As of P43, 853 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from P34 (211 units) is now 8 periods overdue (Promised L=2) and should be considered lost, bringing the total ghost pipeline to 1064 units. The OR backend's 'In-transit' balance is 1105, which is almost entirely comprised of these ghost units, preventing the system from placing new orders unless we use an explicit mu_hat offset. I set mu_hat to (1+L)*target_demand + ghost_offset = (1+2)*95 + 1064 = 1349. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture standard volatility and the recent demand spike. L remains at the default promised value of 2, as recent successful deliveries (P40, P41) reflect a lead time of 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered units) updated to 1064 units (added P34 which is now 8 periods overdue). This inflation blocks system ordering. Demand regime post-peak follows ~93 units/period average (excluding Black Friday spike).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive 'ghost pipeline' due to multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29, P34), totaling 1,064 units. These units appear as 'In-transit' in the system but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to stop ordering because it thinks supply is sufficient. The current in-transit visibility is 1,424 units, of which 1,064 are 'ghosts', leaving only 360 units of viable inventory. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime after the seasonal peak and Black Friday spike; the average demand for P37-P44 (excluding the P42 spike) is ~63 units/period. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value to cover (L+1) periods of actual demand PLUS the ghost inventory offset (1,064). Lead time is set to 3 to reflect recent actual delivery times (P40 arrived in P43). mu_hat calculation: (3+1) * 63 + 1064 = 1316.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered units) updated to 1,064 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29, P34). Current demand regime (excluding holiday spikes) stabilized at ~63 units/period. Continuous mu_hat offset of +1064 is required until system inventory is reconciled.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (Christmas/End of year). Recent demand (P44-P45) has shown an uptick to an average of ~58.5 units. Total ghost pipeline inventory is confirmed at 1,064 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29, P34), which are lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' balance of 1455 units. To ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order for the upcoming periods, mu_hat must be set as (Recent Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Units. Using the stabilized post-peak demand mean of ~65 units (P10-P45 context) as a base to ensure sufficient stock. Setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 1260 ((65 * 3) + 1064), and sigma_hat explicitly to account for holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed total ghost pipeline (lost/undelivered units) remains at 1,064 units. Demand regime (excluding holiday spikes) is approximately 63-65 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Julia RW Skinny Denim' has settled into a post-holiday trough. Excluding the Black Friday spike, the demand average over the last four observable periods (P43-P46) is 52.5 units/period. The current in-transit inventory is 1507 units. However, based on our ongoing tracking, 1064 units of this pipeline are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P29, P34). These lost orders significantly inflate the OR backend's perception of available stock, preventing necessary replenishment. To mitigate this and trigger new orders, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1 review period) of actual demand (~158 units) plus an offset to neutralize the 1064 lost units in the pipeline. This leads to an explicit mu_hat of ~1222. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to account for post-holiday stability, and L is set to calculated to reflect the mean lead time including recent 3-period arrivals.
