Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 591334019, a women's sweater. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 120.4 units/week (154, 119, 124, 88, 117), showing a slight downward trend into February. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Since this is the first decision period, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent and relevant behavior for this seasonal item. This leads to mu_hat covering (1+L)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). In Period 1, we ordered 160 units, which are in-transit with a promised lead time (L) of 2. The observation 'arrived=0' in Period 1 conclude is expected as L=2 means arrivals occur in Period 1+2=3. Current on-hand is 0, and we had lost sales/backlog of 79 in Period 1. The demand samples (154, 119, 124, 88, 117) plus the first period demand (79) show a mean of approximately 113.5. Given this is a 'Slightly shorter jumper... fine knit', we are in the tail end of winter/early spring in February. Demand seems stable but slightly declining from the peak in early January. I will use recent_N=6 (all available data points including Period 1) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is a women's sweater/jumper. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows values around 88-154, with the last two recorded periods at 79 and 128. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (160 units) and Period 2 (158 units), totaling 318 units in-transit. Per the 'Critical Timing Example', the P1 order (lead time 2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales because the initial stock was 0. The demand remains relatively stable. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent performance (117, 154, 119, 124, 88 from history, plus recent 79 and 128) while sticking to the promised lead time of 2. L=2 means mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated across (1+L)=3 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. We are looking at a women's lightweight jumper. Demand history (samples + game history) shows values of 154, 119, 124, 88, 117, 79, 128, 72. There is a slight downward trend in the last few weeks, possibly as winter transitions to spring. The average demand is approximately 110. Promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered in P1, P2, and P3 but nothing has arrived yet. According to the lead time rules, an order placed in P1 with L=2 should arrive during P3's arrival resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message (read at the start of P4) shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the P1 order (160 units) is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Since on-hand is 0 and we have 385 units in-transit, we must account for the likely longer lead time (L=3) and the recent demand cooling. I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended risk period.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time appears to be at least 3 periods, as the P1 order did not arrive by the P3 conclude message.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1282.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is a women's sweater/nightwear item. Looking at the history, the order from Period 1 (160 units) has NOT arrived as of the Period 4 conclude message, while the order from Period 2 (158 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2). This indicates the Period 1 shipment is likely lost or significantly delayed, confirming the previous insight that lead times are unreliable. Total on-hand is 86, and in-transit is 310 (comprising orders from P1, P3, and P4). However, treating the P1 order (160 units) as 'lost' is safer for availability. Demand over the last 5 samples (154, 119, 124, 88, 117) averages 120.4/week, with recent history showing a slight dip (79, 128, 72, 72). Given we are moving into March (transitioning out of peak winter), I will use the mean of the last 5 samples to estimate demand. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to match the promised and recently observed lead time, but I must ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the 'void' left by the likely lost Period 1 shipment. Since the OR engine subtracts all 'in-transit' from the base stock, and P1 is likely never coming, I will use an explicit mu_hat to boost the target inventory to account for that missing 160 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (160 units) likely lost: did not arrive by Period 4 conclude while Period 2 order arrived on time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a soft jumper (women's nightwear/leisure). Historical demand (prior + periods 1-5) averages ~104 units/week. Period 5 demand was low (46), but the overall trend remains steady. Regarding lead times: the P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2), but the P1 order (ordered P1, expected P3 or P4) is definitively lost, as it has not appeared by the P5 conclude message. On-hand is 40 units, and in-transit is 511 (from orders in P3, P4, and P5). Since P3 (67 units) and P4 (83 units) orders are expected to arrive in P5 and P6 respectively (concluding in P6 and P7), we must ensure we don't over-order while accounting for the lost P1 units. I will use the promised lead time L=2 and a recent_N average for demand (N=5, covering the active game periods) to stabilize the forecast against the recent low demand outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Loss of Period 1 order (160 units) confirmed; it significantly lags the successfully delivered Period 2 order.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU is a 'soft, fine knit jumper', which traditionally sees a seasonal decline as spring arrives. Historical demand shows a downward trend: 154, 119, 124, 88, 117 (pre-game) and 79, 128, 72, 72, 46, 46 (game). The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 59 units, significantly lower than the earlier average of ~120. Regarding lead times: the Period 1 order is confirmed lost. The Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (promised), the Period 5 order arrived in 1 period (early). The Period 3 (67 units) and Period 4 (83 units) orders are still in transit and are within a reasonable arrival window for a 2-period lead time. On-hand inventory is 195, plus 150 units in transit (expected shortly), giving a total pipeline of 345 units. Given the declining seasonal demand (Spring), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (last 4 periods) to avoid overstocking while holding costs accumulate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: avg demand decreased from ~110 to ~59 (-46%) starting Period 3 as winter ends.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1. The product is a sweater, which typically sees declining demand as spring progresses. Recent demand (Periods 3-7) shows a shift: 72, 72, 46, 46, 55 (avg ~58), compared to initial samples (154, 119, 124, 88, 117, avg ~120). This confirms the demand regime shift previously identified. The Period 1 order (160 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 2 order arrived with Lead Time (L)=2, while the Period 5 order arrived with L=1. Given the volatility in arrival and the confirmed loss, I will maintain L=2 as a conservative estimate. \u03bc\u0302 is set to capture the new demand regime using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5), and \u03c3\u0302 will be calculated over the same window to reflect recent variability as we transition into warmer weather.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a soft knit jumper (sweater), which is seeing a significant decline in demand as winter transitions into spring. Historical demand initially averaged ~110 units (P1-P2) and has shifted to a lower regime of ~55 units (P3-P8). In-transit inventory is 310 units, consisting of orders from P3 (67 units), P4 (83 units), and P5 (amount reconciled as 201 arrived previously, but tracking reveals P3/P4 orders are technically overdue or lost based on P2/P5 arriving). Given on-hand (88) and the large pipeline (310), we are well-covered for the current seasonal demand. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower demand regime since the drop in late February, and keep L at default (2) as recent arrivals (P4/P6) suggest erratic but generally near-promised lead times.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. The product is a 'fine knit sweater', which is reaching the end of its peak season in Spring. Demand has clearly shifted: from P1-P2 (avg ~103) to P3-P9 (avg ~53.7). The last four periods (P6-P9) show an average of 44, suggesting a further softening as temperatures rise. The Period 1 order is confirmed lost. Since the P5 order arrived in 1 period (P6 conclude), but the promised L is 2, the lead time is varying. On-hand is 65. In-transit is 310, which likely includes the lost P1 (160), the P3 order (67), and the P4 order (83). If P3 and P4 are still in transit after 5-6 periods, they are also likely lost or severely delayed. To avoid over-ordering due to high pipeline inventory that may never arrive, I will use a conservative demand forecast (recent_N=4) to reflect the current low-demand spring regime and keep L at default to maintain a 3-period coverage window.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity issues: Orders from P1 (160), P3 (67), and P4 (83) are likely lost as they are well past the observed lead times. Total likely active pipeline is 0.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. Demand context for this women's sweater (nightwear/fine knit) shows a significant seasonal decline as we move into late spring (April). Average demand in the last 4 periods (P7-P10) is 36.75 units, a clear drop from the early February highs of >100 units. Pipeline check: In-transit is 310, units likely lost were ordered P1 (160), P3 (67), and P4 (83), totaling 310 units. This implies the 'In-transit' figure consists entirely of ghost inventory that will never arrive. Effectively, the pipeline is zero. On-hand is 48. With demand at ~17-23 recently, I need to replenish. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (N=4) to avoid overstocking a seasonal item. Lead time remains volatile (observed 1 and 2 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average valid arrivals. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the low-regime (P7-P10 avg: ~37 units) as late spring continues; pipeline inventory of 310 units is confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4 orders).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a lightweight sweater, which is entering its off-season as temperatures rise. Demand has stabilized at a low level; the mean demand from Period 7 to Period 11 is approximately 32.6 units (55, 52, 23, 17, 16). The pipeline inventory of 310 units (from P1, P3, and P4) is confirmed lost as they are significantly past all observed lead times (P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (310) from the base stock to calculate orders, and our actually active pipeline is 0, we must force an order by setting mu_hat to a high 'explicit' value that offsets the phantom 310 units. Our target base stock to cover L+1 (3) periods of demand at the current rate (avg ~30) is approximately 90-100 units. To trigger this, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Pipeline) = 100 + 310 = 410. This ensures the OR engine places an order to replenish the on-hand inventory (currently 32) before it depletes further.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/06. The SKU is a sweater, which is entering a low-demand season (late spring/summer). Recent demand (P7-P12) shows a significant regime shift, averaging ~32.6 units/period, compared to the early winter average of ~110. The 'In-transit' quantity of 433 includes 310 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost (well past the 2-period promised lead time), and the 123 units ordered in P12. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the recent low-demand regime (N=6) to reflect the current seasonal trend. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised). The OR backend uses the pipeline inventory (which it sees as 433) to calculate orders. Since 310 of those units are lost, I must set mu_hat high enough 'explicitly' or adjust parameters so the backend orders enough to cover the actual shortfall, but since I cannot directly subtract from the backend's 'In-transit' tally, I will use an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the fact that the 310 units are non-existent. Specifically, needed base stock for L=2 is roughly 3 periods of demand (3 * 33 = 100). The backend will see 433 in transit and order 0 unless I compensate. However, to maintain the logic of the OR engine while signaling the loss, I must increase mu_hat to 'paper over' the phantom inventory, or risk stockouts. I'll set mu_hat to cover the expected demand (33 * 3) plus the lost units (310) to force the engine to see a need, but since the cap might trigger, I'll use explicit values to ensure we keep stock for the current low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~33 units/period (P7-P12) for the spring season. Total lost pipeline inventory confirmed at 310 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/13. The product is a lightweight sweater ('slightly shorter jumper'), which is likely entering a seasonal low as summer approaches. Demand has stabilized at a low regime; the average demand from Period 7 to Period 13 is ~31 units. The on-hand inventory is 0, and the system shows 460 units in-transit. However, as documented in Carry-over Insights, 310 of these units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. The remaining 150 units in-transit consist of the P12 order (123 units) and P13 order (27 units). The P12 order (placed May 6) is expected to arrive in Period 14 or 15 given the promised lead time of 2. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 460 'in-transit' units from the base stock calculation, it will likely not place an order. To force an order that covers the current demand regime and accounts for the 310 lost units essentially 'ghosting' the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the total reported pipeline (460) to ensure the backend triggers a replenishment for the next cycle, targeting a base stock that covers ~3 periods of demand (approx 100 units) PLUS the 310 lost units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/20 (Late Spring). The SKU is a sweater, which naturally faces lower demand as temperatures rise. The demand has shifted from a high-winter regime (avg ~110 in Periods 1-2) to a low-spring regime (avg ~33 since Period 7, recently dropping even lower to 13-17 in P10-P14). The order placed in Period 12 (123 units) arrived in Period 14 (lead time = 2), leaving 110 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' is 338 units, but earlier insights confirm 310 units (from P1, P3, P4) are lost. Therefore, the active pipeline is 28 units (P13 order of 27 plus P14 order of 1). Total available inventory (on-hand 110 + active pipeline 28) = 138 units. At current demand levels (~20/week), this covers approx 7 weeks of demand, which is excessive given the seasonal decline. I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand to capture the low-season regime (P7-P14 mean ~24) and recent_N (N=3) for lead time, as the latest arrival (P14) confirms a lead time of 2 periods. The OR engine will likely order 0 or very little given the high stock relative to the low seasonal demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (Late May), we are in a low-demand regime for this knit sweater/jumper SKU, consistent with late spring/early summer. Demand from P12-P15 averaged 21.25 units, significantly lower than the winter peak. The pipeline inventory (338 units) includes 310 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are confirmed lost. The active pipeline likely only includes orders from P13 (27 units) and P14 (1 unit). On-hand inventory is 98 units, which covers over 4 periods of current demand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower seasonal demand floor and set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to account for the reduced volatility in this regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 2 periods, as arrivals for P12 followed this pattern. No new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the current high on-hand relative to the low demand forecast.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU (a sweater/jumper) is in a low-demand summer phase. Demand has sharply declined from winter levels (~110 units) to a stable spring/summer average of ~20 units over the last 10 periods (P7-P16) and an even lower average of ~15 units over the last 4 periods (P13-P16). The 'In-transit' quantity of 338 units includes confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 310 units). The valid pipeline contains the P13 order (27 units) and P14 order (1 unit), both of which are overdue if L=2, suggesting lead time variability or further losses. However, the backend needs to target a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Given the current 87 units on-hand and the seasonal decline for a sweater, I will use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the post-winter regime. I set L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P4, P6, P14) had lead times of 2, 1, and 2 respectively. The current on-hand inventory (87) is roughly 6 weeks of supply (at 15 units/week), which is ample for the current season.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P13-P16): average demand dropped to ~16 units/period, down from the earlier spring average of ~33.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. The product is a sweater (knit jumper), which is naturally experiencing a seasonal low during the summer months. Demand has stabilized at a low regime; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 15 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 75 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of current demand. Pipeline inventory (338 units) includes 310 units confirmed lost from early periods (P1, P3, P4) and 28 units from P13-P14 which are now nearing or past their expected delivery window. With a 2-period promised lead time, the OR engine's base stock calculation (which includes full pipeline) would prevent any ordering. However, given the high on-hand stock relative to summer demand, no new orders are currently needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent summer low (approx 15 units/period) and L to the promised lead time of 2 periods to maintain a lean inventory through the off-season. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that is likely lower than the current (on-hand + 'lost' pipeline), resulting in zero new orders as intended.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a sweater, which is currently in its lowest demand season (summer). Demand has dropped significantly from an average of ~33 units in early spring to approximately 11 units per period in the last 4 periods (P15-P18). On-hand inventory is 67 units, which covers about 6 periods of current demand. The pipeline (In-transit: 338 units) is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders from P1 (160), P3 (67), and P4 (83), totaling 310 lost units. The only valid active in-transit units are from P13 (27) and P14 (1), which are delayed (lead time > 2). Since on-hand inventory is already high relative to the current summer demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the summer demand drop and setting L to 'calculate' to account for observed delivery variability, although the OR backend will cap orders due to the 67 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor reached: Period 15-18 average is 10.75 units, significantly lower than the previous spring average of 33. Pipeline remains unreliable with 310 units confirmed lost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product is a sweater, which is out of season during the summer months. Demand has hit a floor, averaging only ~8 units over the last 5 periods (P15-P19). On-hand inventory is 65 units, which provides over 8 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Regarding the pipeline, the 'In-transit' quantity is 338 units, but based on past observations (Carry-over insights), 310 of these are confirmed lost (from P1, P3, and P4). The remaining 28 units (from P13 and P14) are also significantly overdue (promised lead time is 2), suggesting they are also likely lost. However, even if they arrive, the current on-hand stock is more than sufficient. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current very low summer demand regime. Lead time (L) remains at default as there is no reliable evidence of a consistent shift in delivery for the few orders that actually arrived.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor reaffirmed (Period 15-19): average demand is 8.2 units per period. All 338 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) are now treated as lost due to extreme delivery delays.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of summer (July 1st), and the product is a sweater (fine knit jumper), which has seen a dramatic demand decline from ~110 in February to ~2 in recent weeks. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is only 7.0 units. On-hand inventory is 63 units, which provides over 9 weeks of coverage at current demand rates. The in-transit inventory of 338 units includes orders from as far back as Period 1 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) and is definitely lost. The OR backend's cap mechanism needs to be informed that these units in-transit do not actually exist so it doesn't starve future orders should demand rise, even though we shouldn't order now. I am setting L=2 (promised) as it's the most reliable confirmed data. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering the summer low) to reflect the current floor of ~7 units/period. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the current low volatility. No orders will be triggered by the backend due to the high on-hand relative to the low base stock.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, the heart of the summer season. The product is a fine-knit sweater, which is out-of-season, explaining the current 'summer floor' demand regime. For Period 21, the demand was 6 units, and the average for the last five periods (P17-P21) is 6.0 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 57 units, which covers approximately 9 periods of current demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 338 units comprises orders from P1, P3, P4 (310 units total) and P13, P14 (28 units total). Given that P14 was ordered 8 periods ago and the promised lead time is 2, all 338 units are considered lost. However, because on-hand inventory is already high relative to current demand, no new orders are required. mu_hat is set using N=5 to capture the stable low-demand summer floor (Avg 6.0 * (1+L) = 18). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to minimize stock-out risk while avoiding over-ordering in a low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor further stabilized (Period 17-21): average demand is 6.0 units per period. All 338 units in-transit are confirmed lost as even the most recent 'in-transit' order (P14) is now 8 periods overdue.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, representing the peak of the summer season for a 'shorter jumper in a soft, fine knit'. Historical demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has dropped significantly, averaging 6.67 units per period, which aligns with the global summer season for knitwear. The pipeline inventory (338 units) is entirely composed of orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14, all of which are excessively overdue given the promised lead time of 2 periods and are considered lost based on previous carry-over insights. With 47 units on-hand and a projected consumption of ~7 units per period, the current stock is sufficient for approximately 6-7 periods. To prevent unnecessary holding costs for this seasonal item during its low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the summer demand regime. Lead time is set to default as recent arrivals (P12) were on time, while the old 'in-transit' units are recognized as sunk losses by the OR backend's inability to reconcile them.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019, which is peak summer. The product is a knit jumper/sweater, which has very low demand during this season. Recent demand (Period 17-23) has been extremely low and stable, averaging approx. 7.0 units/period (12, 8, 2, 2, 6, 10, 9). The current on-hand inventory is 38 units, which covers nearly 5.5 periods of the current low demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 338 units consists of orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14, all of which are significantly overdue and confirmed lost in previous insights. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (338 units) from the target base stock, it would result in a zero order even if we actually needed stock. However, since on-hand (38) is already quite high relative to the current demand (7), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the summer floor, and use 'explicit' for L to maintain the promised lead time of 2 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product is a soft knit jumper, which is highly seasonal and currently in its lowest demand period (summer). Demand has stabilized at a very low level: the average demand over the last 8 periods (P17-P24) is approximately 7.25 units. The 338 units listed as 'In-transit' are from orders placed between P1 and P14 (ranging from 11 to 24 periods ago) and are definitively lost, meaning the actual pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 29 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 4 periods. Since the promised lead time is 2, and the OR backend uses a base-stock policy that looks at (L+1) periods of demand, current stock is sufficient. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=8) and allow the OR engine to determine if any order is needed based on these parameters. Given the lost shipments, I will use lead time 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries (2 periods), but keep mu_hat low to prevent over-ordering a winter item during summer.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is August 5th (Period 26). The product is a knit jumper/sweater, which has seen very low demand during the summer months (June and July). Specifically, the average demand from Period 17 to Period 24 was approximately 8 units per period. However, Period 25 (July 29) showed a significant jump to 25 units, likely signaling the start of pre-autumn demand as customers begin purchasing for cooler weather. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (4 units), and the pipeline of 338 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14) is confirmed lost due to extreme delays. Consequently, effective pipeline inventory is zero. I need to trigger a fresh order to meet the rising demand and rebuild stock. I will set the lead time to an explicit 3 periods to account for the unreliability observed previously. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average demand ~13.8) to capture the recent upward movement, and use an explicit sigma_hat of 15 to account for the high volatility seen in the last period's spike.

Carry-over insight: Pre-autumn demand uptick detected: Period 25 demand jumped to 25 units from a summer average of 8. Pipeline remains at 0 effective units as all 338 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019/8/12). A significant demand uptick has been observed over the last two periods (P25: 25 units, P26: 47 units), confirming the 'pre-autumn' trend noted in Carry-over Insights for this knit jumper. The summer average (P17-P24) was approximately 8 units, but the last two periods average 36 units. On-hand inventory is now 0. The in-transit pipeline of 338 units (from periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14) is confirmed lost as they are all at least 12 periods overdue. To capture the rising autumn demand, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot away from the summer low, resulting in a forecast based on the recent jump (avg ~27). L is set to 'calculate' based on successful deliveries (P2, P5, P12) which average 1.67 periods, but to protect against the pipeline unreliability, a higher base stock is desired. Setting L to 2 (promised) is the safest baseline while the OR backend uses the rising stats.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P25-P26 average demand jumped to 36 units from a summer average (P17-P24) of 8 units (+350%).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand for this women's sweater (single-SKU 591334019) shows a strong seasonal shift as we exit summer and enter autumn. Following a summer floor of roughly 8 units/period, demand has spiked over the last three periods: P25=25, P26=47, and P27=79. This confirms an autumn resurgence. The average demand of the last 3 periods is 50.33 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward momentum. With on-hand at 0 and all 338 units in-transit confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 orders are many periods overdue), the inventory position is effectively 0. The system needs to re-establish stock quickly for the high-demand season. While promised lead time is 2, arrivals have been inconsistent; I will use default (2) for the backend, but the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will reflect the high variance and demand of the recent shift.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge accelerating: P25-P27 average demand is 50.3 units vs 8.0 units in summer (+525%). All 338 units in-transit are written off as lost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' is a sweater, which is now entering its peak autumn/winter demand season. Current date is late August (2019/08/26). Historical demand samples from January (Weeks 1-5) showed an average of ~120 units. Recent performance (P25-P28) shows a clear and rapid surge: 25, 47, 79, and 48 units, averaging ~50 units recently, but trending significantly higher toward the late-January levels as weather cools. On-hand inventory is 0. Although 'In-transit' shows 338 units, carry-over insights and history confirm these are lost capital from periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14 (all significantly past any reasonable lead time). To recover service level, I must order assuming the pipeline is effectively zero. I will set L to 'default' (2) as recent successful deliveries (P12) were on time. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current autumn acceleration (avg ~50), noting that the backend will scale this for the (L+1) period coverage. Sigma_hat is set via N=4 to account for the high volatility during this transition regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter transition confirmed: Demand increased from summer low of ~8 to ~50 units/period (P25-P28). Expecting return to Jan/Feb levels of ~120 units/period as weather continues to cool.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2, 2019. The SKU is a sweater/jumper, which is entering its peak autumn/winter season. Historical demand from Jan/Feb (Period 1-4) showed demand levels between 72 and 128 units per period (avg ~100). Recent demand (P25-P29) has surged from a summer low of 8 units to an average of ~50 units, confirming the transition. However, current on-hand inventory is 0 and all 338 units 'in-transit' (from orders in P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) are confirmed lost, as even the most recent of these is over 15 periods old. I must place a substantial order to capture the upcoming seasonal peak. I will use 'explicit' values to force the OR backend to order stock, as it likely sees 'in-transit' units that do not actually exist. Given a promised lead time of 2 (L=2, meaning 3 periods of risk), and an expected return to ~100+ units/period, I set mu_hat to 360 (covering 3 periods at 120 each) and a high sigma_hat of 60 to protect against the high forecast uncertainty and stockout risk during this ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak confirmed: Demand has shifted from summer lows (~8) to ~50 and is trending toward early-year levels of ~100-120 units/period. Previous in-transit inventory of 338 units is officially written off as lost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. The SKU is a sweater/jumper, which is highly seasonal. We have officially entered the Autumn/Winter demand regime. Historical demand for early 2019 (Jan-Feb) was ~120 units/period. Recent demand (P30) spiked to 130, confirming this return to high volume. The pipeline inventory of 459 units includes 338 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) that are definitively lost. I therefore treat the effective in-transit as 121 units (from P30). With on-hand at 0 and lead time estimated at 2 periods, the OR backend needs parameters that support a base stock covering approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1). I will set mu_hat explicitly to 360 (representing a 120 units/period forecast over 3 periods) to ensure the OR engine places a large enough order to replenish stock for the winter peak, despite the 'phantom' 338 lost units in the pipeline likely causing the OR engine to under-order without explicit intervention.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed winter demand regime: Period 30 demand (130) aligns with Jan/Feb levels (~120). Effective pipeline is only the Period 30 order (121 units); all prior 338 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 591334019 (a women's sweater) has transitioned from its summer demand floor (~8 units/period) into a high-demand winter regime. Current demand (P30: 130, P31: 136) aligns with the early-year levels observed in Jan/Feb (~120 units/period). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 459 units includes 338 units from orders placed in early/mid-2019 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) which have been consistently flagged as lost. The only viable pipeline is the P30 order (121 units). To stabilize inventory against this high-demand regime (avg ~130), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover (L+1) periods of demand at the 130-unit level. Although the backend uses a base-stock policy, providing an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat prevents the 338 lost units from artificially suppressing new orders (since the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' will include them). I will keep L at default (2) as recent successfully delivered orders (P5, P12) showed a 1-2 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Winter Demand Regime (Sept): Average demand for P30-P31 is 133 units, returning to Jan/Feb levels (~120 units). Effective pipeline is only orders from Period 30 onwards; prior 338 units in-transit are definitely lost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We have confirmed a winter demand regime. Periods 30-32 show demand levels of 130, 136, and 162 respectively (avg ~143), which matches the product description (sweater/jumper) and the cooler seasonal transition. On-hand inventory is 0 after selling all 121 units that arrived in Period 32. Total in-transit is 338 units, but as established in previous carry-over insights, these are all lost (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). The OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation will include these 338 units, which will prevent it from ordering. To 'zero out' this phantom inventory, I will set L=0 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to high values to force an order that covers the immediate demand gap, while acknowledging that the lead time is actually 2 periods (as confirmed by the P30 order arrival). Using L=0 prevents the backend from subtracting the full 338 units of 'in-transit' stock from the target base stock of a 3-period window (L+1). However, since Pip = In-transit + On-hand, and Pip (338) > target, I must use 'explicit' values to force the system to order. Target stock for L=2 and mean demand ~145 should be ~435 units + safety stock. I will set mu_hat to 850 and L to 0 to trigger a clearing of the current stockout.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 591334019 (Sweater/Jumper) has entered its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Historical demand in the same season (Jan/Feb) was ~120 units, but recent weeks show an accelerating trend: P30 (130), P31 (136), P32 (162), and P33 (307). The average demand of the last 4 periods is ~184 units, but the jump to 307 suggests a significant seasonal spike. To prevent stockouts during this high-profit window ($19/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current momentum, which the OR backend will scale for the 2-period lead time (L+1=3). We expect the Period 33 order of 759 units to arrive in Period 35, assuming current lead-time stability. Previous Carry-over insights regarding 338 lost units from early periods remain valid, so the effective pipeline is primarily the Period 33 order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Significant seasonal spike detected (demand increased from ~140 to 307) as sweater season peaks in late September.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '591334019' (Womens Sweater) has entered its peak seasonal demand phase (Autumn/Winter). A massive demand spike occurred in Period 33 (307 units), followed by 180 units in Period 34. The average demand for the last two periods (P33-P34) is 243.5 units. Total in-transit inventory is 1097 units, but 338 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. This leaves an effective pipeline of 759 units (ordered in P33). Lead time is stable at 2 periods (confirmed by P30 order arriving in P32). Since on-hand is currently 0 and the P33 order (759 units) is expected to arrive in Period 35 Arrival Resolution, I need to ensure the base stock covers the current high demand regime. I will use an explicit lead time of 2. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit value based on the recent peak demand average (forecasted at ~240 units/period * (L+1) = 720). I will use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Peak seasonal demand for sweaters confirmed: Period 33-34 average is 243.5 units, significantly higher than the early September average of 133 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, and the product is a sweater, which is in peak seasonal demand. Recent demand (P33-P35) has averaged 225 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0, and while the in-transit inventory shows 1097 units, 338 of those have been confirmed lost in previous periods. The effective pipeline includes the Period 33 order (759 units), which is expected to arrive this period (P36) in the arrival resolution phase (based on the confirmed 2-period lead time from P32). Because demand is high/seasonal and the inventory is currently 0, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime (~225 units/period) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 2-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=3).

Carry-over insight: Peak sweater season continues (Oct): P33-P35 average demand is 225 units/period. The Period 33 order (759 units) is the first major replenishment expected to arrive and resolve the stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1761.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Period 33 order of 759 units arrived in Period 36 (actual lead time of 3 periods), resolving the prolonged stockout. Currently, we have 633 units on hand. The product is a sweater, and we are in mid-October, entering the peak winter season. Demand peaked in late September (P33-P35 avg: 225) and slightly cooled in P36 (126), but remains significantly higher than early September levels. I will use the average of the last 4 periods (P33-P36) to capture this winter demand level (avg: 200.25). Although the promised lead time is 2, recent history (P33) shows a lead time of 3 periods, so I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed delivery delay. This will maintain a higher base stock to prevent another stockout during the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trend update: Period 33 order arrived in 3 periods (P36), confirming a shift from the promised 2 periods to 3. Winter demand regime (P33-P36) average is ~200 units/period, roughly 60% higher than the early September average of 133.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'shorter jumper in a soft, fine knit', which is a quintessential autumn/winter product. Current status is Late October (Period 38). Demand has significantly increased as expected for this category, with a recent winter regime average (P33-P37) of 199 units per period. The Period 37 demand was 194 units, consistent with this. Regarding lead time, the Period 33 order arrived in 3 periods (Period 36), whereas the promised lead time is 2. The Period 32 conclusion also showed a 2-period lead time for the P30 order. I will use L=3 to be conservative given the recent delay and the criticality of peak season. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (~200 units/period) across the lead time + review period. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. The 'in-transit' units (420) include the historic 338 units confirmed lost and the P37 order of 82 units. The OR backend will see 420 in-transit; however, since 338 are lost, my mu_hat needs to ensure the order covers the gap without over-relying on phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility: P33 order arrived in 3 periods instead of promised 2. Winter demand regime for sweaters fully active (P33-P37 avg: 199 units/period).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are in the peak winter sweater season. Demand has stabilized at a high level; the average demand for the last six periods (P33-P38) is 195.7 units. The recent lead time observations (P33 arrived in 3 periods, P37 arrived in 1 period) suggest a volatile lead time, but the average remains close to the promised 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 342 units. The 'In-transit' count of 493 includes the 338 units confirmed lost in previous carry-over insights (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), plus the P38 order of 155 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 155 units. Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 497 units. To cover (L+1) periods of demand at the current average (approx 200 * 3 = 600), we need slightly more stock. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the current winter regime (P33-P38), and use an explicit lead time of 2 to reflect the average expected behavior despite recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P33-P38) average stabilized at ~196 units/period. Effective pipeline remains only orders placed from Period 30 onwards; all previous 338 units are lost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak winter sweater season (Nov 11). Demand in the most recent regime (P33-P39) has averaged 185 units/period, though the most recent sample (P39) showed a dip to 124. Lead times have been volatile: P33 arrived in 3 periods, P37 arrived in 1 period, and P38 (due now if L=2) has not yet been confirmed in a 'conclude' message. Given the historical loss of 338 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) and recent volatility, I will maintain mu_hat based on the peak season average (N=7 for P33-P39) to ensure sufficient stock for the remainer of the high-demand period. I use N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent fluctuations. I'll use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to average the observed lead times (including the recent 3 and 1 period arrivals). Pipeline inventory currently includes the P38 order (155 units).

Carry-over insight: Winter peak sweater regime (P33-P39) average demand is 185 units/period. Lead time volatility observed: shift from promised 2 to actuals of 3 (P33) and 1 (P37).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18, entering late autumn/early winter. The product is a sweater, which is in peak seasonal demand. Recent demand (P33-P40) has averaged 174 units per period, showing a slight softening from the October peak (P33-P35 avg ~225) but remaining significantly higher than early September levels. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this current winter regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect current volatility. Lead time has been volatile, recently observing 3 periods (P33) and 1 period (P37); however, the promised lead time is 2. Since 338 units of pipeline inventory are confirmed lost (P1-P14), and the Period 38 order (155 units) is still within the expected arrival window, the OR backend must account for the high demand. I will set L to 'default' (2 periods) as there is no consistent evidence of a sustained shift away from the 2-period expectation, despite the recent 3 and 1 period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (P33-P40) average stabilized at ~174 units/period, showing seasonal longevity but a slight taper from the late September peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. We are in the late autumn/early winter season for sweaters. Demand has transitioned from a peak in late September (~225 units/period) to a lower but steady winter regime. Over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), demand has been 179, 124, 95, and 71, averaging 117 units. This indicates a seasonal taper as we head towards the end of the year. Lead times have been volatile (1, 2, and 3 periods observed recently), but the 'calculate' method will allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times, effectively bridging the 1-3 period range. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=9) to capture the demand regime since mid-September (P33-P41), which averages ~163 units/period. This provides a safe buffer for the current taper while accounting for potential late-year demand spikes. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=9) to reflect the high volatility seen during the peak and subsequent taper.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand tapering: Average demand from P38-P41 has decreased to 117 units/period from the P33-P37 average of 199 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/12/2. We are in the winter sweater season. Period 42 saw a demand spike to 149 units, which contradicts the 'tapering' observed in the previous three periods (avg ~96). The winter regime (P33-P42) now averages 171 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory includes 338 units confirmed lost from early periods and active orders from P38 (155), P41 (91), and P42 (51), totaling 297 active units in the pipeline. Note that the P38 order (155 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P38, currently P43 start), which is concerning given our inferred lead time of 2-3 periods. I will treat the P38 order as potentially delayed/lost and focus on covering the next (L+1) periods of demand. I'll use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the full winter regime (P33-P42, avg 171.3) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual delivery performance (averaging ~2 periods, though volatile).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in the late winter demand regime for sweaters. Reviewing recent demand, P42 and P43 showed 149 and 71 units respectively. While there was a peak in October (P33-P38 avg ~196), the more recent four-period average (P40-P43) has settled to approximately 96.5 units per period. Lead times have mostly stabilized around the promised 2 periods (P41 arrived in 2), though historical volatility (1 to 3 periods) exists. On-hand inventory is low (20), but 544 units are in-transit (notably the 338 units confirmed lost plus P41-42 orders). Since 338 units are confirmed lost, the effective pipeline is only 206 units (544 - 338). To avoid stockouts while accounting for the tapering seasonal demand, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand level (~97 units/period) rather than the earlier October peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019, approaching the end of the winter season and the final periods of the simulation. Period 44 saw a stockout with demand at 60 units. A demand tapering trend is evident: the peak sweater season (Sept-Oct, P33-P37) averaged ~199, while the most recent 4-week average (P41-P44) has dropped significantly to 87.75 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this holiday/late-season cooling. Service level remains high (target ~95%) due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost. Lead time has stabilized recently at the promised 2 periods (P41 arrived in 2), so I will use the default promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: 338 units are confirmed lost; the effective pipeline is only the P42 order (51 units), as the P38 order (155 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. On-hand is 0. Parameters are set to ensure the remaining pipeline and this period's order cover approximately 3 periods of the current 88-unit demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Late winter demand taper confirmed: Average demand for Period 41-44 is 87.75 units, down from the mid-winter average of ~174 units. Pipeline loss update: Period 38 order (155 units) is now 6 periods overdue and treated as lost, joining the previously lost 183 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), bringing total write-offs to 338 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The SKU is a sweater, currently in a late-winter tapering demand phase. Average demand for the last four periods (P42-P45) is 84.75 units, a clear decline from the mid-winter peak of ~174. The Period 42 order arrived in Period 45 (L=3), while the Period 41 order arrived in Period 43 (L=2). Mean lead time remains around 2-3 periods. Regarding inventory: on-hand is 0. In-transit shows 493 units, but 338 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P38). The effective pipeline is 155 units (the P38 order, despite being overdue, is the most recent large order not yet officially written off, though its delay is concerning). Given the date (Dec 23), we expect demand to continue tapering or remain steady before the spring drop. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand level (~85 units/period) and set L=2 as the baseline, as the backend's base-stock calculation (L+1) will then cover ~255 units to manage potential stockouts while acknowledging the seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Late winter demand regime (P42-P45) average is 84.75 units/period, confirming a downward trend from the autumn peak. Total confirmed pipeline loss persists at 338 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 47 (Dec 30), the product (women's sweater) is entering the mid-winter/late-winter phase. Demand has significantly tapered from the late autumn peak (~200 units/period) to a more stable late-season regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 76.2 units. Despite recent stockouts, this lower demand level is consistent with seasonal cooling. Regarding lead times, the most recent arrivals (P41 arriving in 2 periods, P42 arriving in 3 periods) suggest lead time is still volatile around the promised 2-period mark, but averaging slightly higher. Total in-transit is 493 units, but 338 of these have been classified as lost in carry-over insights (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P38). The only valid pipeline order is the one from P41/P42 that hasn't arrived or was partially reconciled, but my on-hand is 0. With nearly 500 units technically in-transit (even if mostly lost), the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent large new orders. I will set mu_hat to reflect the late-winter average of ~76 units across the 3nd-period horizon (L=2) to maintain a lean but sufficient stock level as demand continues to decline toward spring.

Carry-over insight: Late winter demand regime (P42-P46) average is 76.2 units/period, showing a steady decrease from the P33 peak. Total write-off pipeline units remains 338.
