Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'SUPREME tights'. Historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a clear upward trend: 292, 300, 355, 391, and 372. The average demand across these 5 weeks is 342. This item is 'Sports tights in fast-drying functional fabric', and February is typically the start of the 'spring fitness season' where demand for activewear remains high or increases. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To cover demand over the review plus lead time (1+2=3 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher demand levels while the OR engine calculates the base stock based on these averages. Starting with the promised lead time (L=2) via the 'default' method as there is no arrival history yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'SUPREME tights', a sports garment. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend: 292, 300, 355, 391, 372 (last 5 weeks). The demand in Period 1 was 325, with 0 sold due to 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 2. An order of 415 units was placed in Period 1, which is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2). Since we have no stock on hand and demand is currently averaging around 350-370 per week, we need to maintain inventory levels. The demand seems to have shifted higher in late January/early February compared to early January. I will use the last 4 samples (including Period 1 demand) to calculate mu_hat, representing the more recent higher demand regime. With L=2, the base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU 680262001 (Sports tights) is experiencing a period of high demand, likely driven by the start of the year fitness season. Historical demand has trended upwards from 292 (Jan 7) to 421 (Period 2), indicating a clear growth regime. Inventory is currently 0 because arrivals for orders placed in Period 1 (with a promised lead time of 2) are not visible until the start of Period 4. In-transit inventory stands at 822 units (415 from P1 + 407 from P2). To set parameters: 1) Lead time (L) remains at the promised 2 periods (default), as we haven't seen any concluded arrivals yet to suggest otherwise. 2) For \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat), demand is clearly rising; the last 3 samples (372, 325, 421) average ~373. For a review+lead period of (1+L)=3, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this elevated level (approx 1119). 3) For \u03c3\u0302 (sigma_hat), I will also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the higher volatility seen in recent weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-03-04 (Period 4). We are currently in a stock-out situation with 0 units on-hand. Looking at the history, we have placed orders in Period 1 (415 units), Period 2 (407 units), and Period 3 (296 units). The promised lead time is 2 periods. For the Period 1 order to have arrived by the end of Period 3, the lead time would have needed to be 2. Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, the Period 1 order is either delayed or the lead time is at least 3 periods. In the 'conclude' message for Period 3, we see zero arrivals even though an order was placed in Period 1. Based on the rules, if L=2, an order placed in P1 arrives during P3 and is visible in the P3 conclude message read at P4 start. Since it is still 0, we must assume L is at least 3. Demand is showing an upward trend: 292, 300, 355, 391, 372 (pre-game) and 325, 421, 366 (in-game). The product is 'SUPREME tights' (activewear), which often sees stable or increasing demand in early spring. I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay and use recent_N for demand to capture the higher levels seen recently (~370-380 range).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is 'SUPREME tights', a sports functional garment. Historical demand across the last 5 periods (including samples) shows a steady upward trend/regime: 292, 300, 355, 391, 372 (samples) followed by 325, 421, 366, 315 in the game. Mean demand is approximately 349. Period 4 conclude shows an arrival of 407 units (ordered P2, arrived P4), confirming the promised lead time (L=2). However, the order from Period 1 (415 units) has NOT arrived as of Period 4 conclude. If L=2, P1 should have arrived in P3. It is now likely a lost shipment or significantly delayed. On-hand is 92, and in-transit is 1093 (P1: 415, P3: 296, P4: 382). If P1 is lost, the effective pipeline is 678. To ensure coverage for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~1050 units), I will maintain L=2 and use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current demand level. I will use 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in the recent peaks (421).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'SUPREME tights' (Sports). Demand history: 292, 300, 355, 391, 372 (pre-game) and 325, 421, 366, 315, 255 (in-game). Recent game demand (P1-P5) average is 336.4. Inventory status: currently 0 on-hand with 1093 in-transit. Pipeline analysis: P1 order (415 units) is now overdue (promised L=2, currently P6 start, so it should have arrived in P3 conclude or P4 conclude if delayed). The P2 order (407 units) arrived in P4 (L=2 confirmed). P3, P4, and P5 orders (296, 382, 0) remain in-transit. Because the P1 order is likely lost or significantly delayed, the backend OR needs to account for this gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand trend (avg ~336). For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (2) as the P2 order arrived on time, but I will monitor the P1 'lost' status. The current in-transit (1093) minus the likely lost P1 (415) leaves 678 effective in-transit units, which is roughly 2 periods of demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is H&M Sport tights. Historical demand (P1-P3) averaged ~370, but recent demand (P4-P6) has dropped to an average of ~267, suggesting a potential post-peak or seasonal shift. Regarding inventory, we have a major visibility issue: The order from Period 1 (415 units) is now 4 periods past promise (Lead time 2) and has not arrived; the order from Period 3 (296 units) is also overdue. However, Period 2's order arrived exactly on time in Period 4. This indicates either significant lead time volatility or lost shipments. Total in-transit is 1093. Current on-hand is 0. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To avoid over-ordering while waiting for the large pipeline to land, I will use a recent_N (N=3) demand forecast to reflect the lower recent mean (~267). I will keep L at default (2) because P2 arrived on time, but I will monitor P1 and P3. If they don't arrive next period, they are likely lost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU '680262001' (Supreme tights) is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows inconsistent lead times: while the Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (Period 4), the Period 1 order (415 units) and Period 3 order (296 units) are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and are likely lost. The demand history shows a peak in late January/February (avg ~350 units) followed by a decline in March (P5-P7 avg ~237 units). With the current date being April 1st, we are moving further into the spring sports season. I will use the recent demand regime (last 3 periods) to set mu_hat, reflecting the current lower trend (~237/week). I will maintain the explicit lead time at the promised 2 periods for the OR backend calculation, but the large pipeline (1093 units) includes the likely lost shipments from P1 and P3. Since the OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory, I must set the parameters to ensure a new order is triggered to break the stockout despite the 'phantom' inventory in transit.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (415 units) and Period 3 (296 units) are likely lost as they are >4 periods overdue. Demand shifted from ~350 to ~237 units/week starting Period 5.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/08. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime starting Period 5 (avg ~235 units/week: 255, 232, 226, 228), significantly down from the earlier weeks (~350+). Product (SUPREME tights) is a staple item, so demand is stable but seasonal transitions can occur. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. Monitoring order arrivals: Period 1 (415) and Period 3 (296) orders are now 8 and 6 periods old respectively, and definitely lost. Period 2 arrived on time. Period 4 (382) is now 5 periods old and still not arrived, suggesting it might also be lost, but I will give it one more period. In-transit shows 1093, which likely counts the lost orders. With 0 on-hand and high lost-shipment rates, I must ensure 'mu_hat' reflects the new demand regime (approx 235/week) while 'sigma_hat' accounts for the high variance in delivery reliability. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*235 = 3 * 235 = 705 and adjust sigma_hat to handle the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Avg demand from Periods 5-8 is 235.25. Period 4 order (382 units) is now 3 periods overdue, signaling severe supply reliability issues.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are managing 'SUPREME tights'. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 5, with the last 5 periods (P5-P9) averaging 224.8 units/week. The last observed demand (P9) was 183. Regarding supply, only the order from Period 2 has arrived (lead time = 2). Orders from P1 (415 units), P3 (296 units), and now P4 (382 units) are significantly overdue (5, 4, and 3 periods late respectively), suggesting they are lost. The total 'In-transit' of 1093 units exactly matches P1+P3+P4 (415+296+382). Since these are likely lost, the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see 1093 in 'pipeline' and prevent new orders. To fix this, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or adjust L to account for the 'lost' pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent demand mean of ~225 for (L+1)=3 periods (675) but add a buffer to offset the ghost inventory. However, a safer way to trigger the OR logic to ignore 'stuck' pipeline is to increase the mu_hat parameter to exceed the current pipeline + desired safety stock. Given the high stockout risk and lost shipments, I will set mu_hat to 1350 (targeting a gross coverage of ~6 periods) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to ensure the backend places a replenishment order immediately.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipments from Period 1, 3, and 4 (total 1093 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Demand regime further stabilized at avg 225 units/week since Period 5.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/22. Demand has shown a significant downward trend, dropping from an average of ~350 (Periods 1-4) to ~225 (Periods 5-9) and most recently to 106 in Period 10. Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (1093 units) are definitively lost, as they are 6+ periods overdue. Only the Period 2 order arrived (lead time = 2). The 'In-transit' of 1400 likely includes these lost orders (415+296+382 = 1093) plus the new Period 10 order (307). To the OR backend, pipeline inventory looks high (1400), but effective pipeline is only 307. I must use the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline inflation. I set L=2 (promised and only observed). For mu_hat, the recent demand is sharply declining; I use recent_N=6 to capture the post-Period 5 regime (Avg: 205). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (1400) from base_stock, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base_stock target by the amount of lost inventory (approx 1100 units) to ensure an order is triggered to meet actual demand while on-hand is 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~350 to ~190 over the last 6 periods. Significant supply chain failure: 1093 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are lost, causing persistent stockouts despite high 'In-transit' accounting.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU 'SUPREME tights' is facing a severe supply chain failure and a downward demand regime shift. Inventory status: On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 1700, but Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (415), P3 (296), and P4 (382) are lost, totaling 1,093 units. This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 607 units (P10 and P11 orders). Demand has significantly dropped: the mean of the last 7 periods (P5-P11) is ~188 units, with the most recent two periods dropping to ~98 units. This aligns with post-spring sportswear seasonality. To address the OR backend's ignorance of these 'lost' 1093 units which inflate the pipeline inventory and prevent new orders, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. My calculation: Targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods (L+1) of the current low demand (~150/week) plus an offset to neutralize the phantom 1093 units. Projected base stock = (3 * 150) + 1093 = 1543. I set mu_hat to this value so the backend (base_stock - pipeline) creates a replenishment order of ~150-300 units to secure upcoming stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further downward: mean of last 3 periods is ~126 units/week compared to early period average of ~350.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th, and the product is sports tights. Historically, demand for this item peaked in Jan/Feb (avg ~350) and has steadily declined through Spring (P10-P12 avg ~124). There is a critical supply chain failure: orders from P1, P3, and P4 (1093 units) are lost. These lost units still inflate the 'In-transit' figure on the backend. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, the presence of these 1093 phantom units will prevent new orders from being placed. I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat parameter to override this by providing a value that accounts for both the forecast demand for (L+1) periods and the 1093 units that will never arrive. The required base stock to cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at current demand (~124/week) is 372. To force an order despite the 1093 units in transit, I set mu_hat to 372 + 1093 = 1465. This ensures the engine sees a need for safety stock beyond the stalled pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime for Spring (P9-P12): ~124 units/week. Significant under-delivery persists; pipeline is clogged with 1093 units from P1, P3, P4 that are definitively lost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (P14), transitioning out of the early spring period. The product is sports tights. Demand has shifted significantly downward from an initial average of ~350 units to a more stable recent average of approximately 120-130 units (mean of P10-P13 is 121). A major system issue exists: the 'In-transit' count of 1400 includes 1093 units from Period 1 (415), Period 3 (296), and Period 4 (382) that are long overdue (9-13 periods) and must be considered lost. Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (1400 units) from the calculated base stock, it will likely order nothing. However, the true available pipeline is only ~307 units (from Period 10). To compensate for the 'ghost' 1093 units in the OR engine's pipeline subtraction, I will set an explicit mu_hat that covers target inventory plus the lost units. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at ~125 units/period = 375. Add back the lost units (1093) = 1468. This ensures the OR logic (1468 - 1400) results in a sensible safety stock level while accounting for the demand regime change.

Carry-over insight: Continued evidence of stabilized low-demand regime: Avg demand P9-P13 is 133.6 units/week. Supply reliability note: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (1093 units) remain lost; pipeline inventory is artificially inflated by these lost units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/05/20), the current demand regime for SUPREME tights is established at a lower level compared to the start of the year. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is approximately 132 units/week. Supply reliability remains the primary concern: 1,093 units ordered in P1, P3, and P4 (415 + 296 + 382) are definitively lost as they are over 10 periods past due. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1,400 units includes these 1,093 lost units and the 307 units ordered in P10. The P10 order is now 5 periods old (promised lead time 2), making it highly suspicious but not yet confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1,400 pipeline from the target base stock, it will not place new orders if I use the promised lead time (L=2). To force the engine to recognize the need for more inventory despite the 'clogged' pipeline, I set L=9 (explicit). This increases the coverage window to (L+1)=10 periods, raising the base stock goal. I set mu_hat to 1320 (132 avg * 10 periods) and sigma_hat to 125 to manage the volatility observe in the last 6 weeks (std dev ~39 * sqrt(10)).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Shipment from Period 10 (307 units) is now 3 periods overdue, joining P1, P3, and P4 as likely failed deliveries. Pipeline is effectively empty of viable stock despite 1400 units showing as in-transit.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following a decline in early spring; the average demand from Period 12 to 15 is 137.75 units/week. The product (Sports tights) shows seasonal stabilization post-winter. Critically, the 'In-transit' count of 1400 units is composed entirely of lost shipments from Periods 1 (415), 3 (296), 4 (382), and 10 (307). Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of these 1400 ghost units will block any new orders unless \u03bc\u0302 is set high enough to offset them. To force an order to refill the empty on-hand inventory, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 explicitly to (1+L) * forecasted_demand + 1400. Forecasted demand is ~138 units/week. With L=2, (1+2)*138 = 414. Adding the 1400 lost units gives a \u03bc\u0302 of 1814. This 'inflation' ensures the OR backend recognizes the actual stockout and triggers a replenishment order for current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed 1400 units in pipeline are lost (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand has settled at ~138 units/week since P12. Standard parameters will result in zero orders due to ghost pipeline inventory; mu_hat must be offset by +1400 to resume replenishment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the 'In-transit' quantity of 1814 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Analysis of the history shows that shipments from P1 (415), P3 (296), P4 (382), and P10 (307) have never arrived and are well beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods, totaling 1400 'ghost' units. The remaining 414 units in-transit from P16 are likely the only valid incoming stock. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime: the average demand from Period 12 to Period 16 is approximately 128.6 units/week. To trigger the OR backend to place an order despite the 1400 units of lost inventory (which the backend subtracts from the target base stock), I must add 1400 units to the expected demand across the review and lead time (L+1 periods). With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should target ((1+L) * 128.6) + 1400 \u2248 1785.8. I will use 1786. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * std(last 5 periods) \u2248 1.732 * 32 \u2248 55. This approach forces the backend to recognize that the pipeline is effectively empty of usable stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains 1400 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Active demand regime is ~129 units/week based on the last 5 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. The demand regime has stabilized following a shift from the high initial demand (avg ~350) to a lower Spring/Summer level. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 115 units/week. The supply chain remains compromised by 1,400 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P10) which never arrived and are over 5 periods overdue. These lost units artificially inflate the pipeline inventory, causing the OR engine to suppress orders. Period 16's order of 414 units arrived in Period 17 (lead time 1), providing 328 units on-hand. To ensure the backend places a necessary replenishment order despite the 1,400 unit pipeline error, I will use an explicit mu_hat set to (Avg Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Using Avg Demand 115 and L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (115 * 3) + 1400 = 1745. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility of the lower-demand regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand has continued to decline, with a 5-period average of 113 units and the most recent three periods dropping to 93, 86, and 74 units, signaling a sustained low-demand regime. Supply chain issues remain critical: 1,400 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P10) are definitively lost/phantom, as demonstrated by the fact that subsequent orders (P11, P16) arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods while these remain in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 254 units, which covers about 2.5-3 periods of current demand. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,400 ghost units as available supply and halting all orders, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that adds this ghost quantity to the actual demand forecast. Using a recent 5-period demand average of ~113 units and a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 339 units. Adding the 1,400 ghost units results in a mu_hat of 1739. Sigma is set based on the volatility of the recent low-demand period (approx. 25-30 units raw std).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further decreased: Avg of last 3 periods is 84 units/week (P16-P18). Ghost inventory remains at 1,400 units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand has shifted significantly downward in the last few periods (P16: 93, P17: 86, P18: 74, P19: 46), with the average of the last 4 periods being 74.75 units/week. This represents a distinct regime change from the ~130 units observed earlier in Spring. On-hand inventory is currently high (225 units), which covers roughly 3 periods of the current demand rate. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P16 order arrived in 1 period, P18 order arrived in 1 period). However, the major issue remains the 1,400 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10) that are definitively lost but still inflate the pipeline. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', the presence of 1,468 in-transit units (1,400 ghost + 68 from P19) will prevent any new orders unless mu_hat is manually offset. To enable the OR engine to order normally while accounting for the lost stock and the new lower demand, I will set mu_hat centrally at the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 75 = 225) plus the 1,400 lost units. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility of this new low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for P16-P19 is ~75 units/week, down from previous mean of ~130. Lead time remains volatile but recently observed at 1 period for P16/P18.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' has entered a significantly lower regime, with the average demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) being ~59 units/week (86, 74, 46, 31), showing a consistent downward trend as summer progresses. The 'ghost inventory' problem persists: 1,400 units from P1, P3, P4, and P10 are confirmed lost, but they remain in the pipeline inventory count (In-transit: 1468). Only 68 units (ordered P19) are actual viable incoming stock. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1,468 units and stopping all ordering, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of ghost inventory (1,400 units). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low demand regime (~59 units/week). Lead time has recently stabilized at 1 period (observed at P17 and P19), so I will set L to 1. mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * 59 + 1400 = 118 + 1400 = 1518.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Avg P17-P20 is ~59 units/week. Lead time recently observed at 1 period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 680262001 (sports tights) is in a clear downward trend as it moves into the summer months (July), with the last four periods averaging ~33.75 units/week (P18-P21 demand: 74, 46, 31, 29). The current on-hand inventory is 165 units, which provides approximately 4-5 weeks of coverage at the latest demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,468 units is significantly inflated by 'ghost inventory' from periods P1, P3, P4, and P10, totaling 1,400 units that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Only 68 units (ordered Period 19) are viable in the pipeline. Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P17, P19) have been 1 period. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,400 ghost units as available supply and prematurely stopping orders when stock is needed, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Given avg demand ~35 and L=1, the required base stock (1+L)*35 = 70. However, the OR logic calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). With on-hand=165 and in_transit=1468, the backend sees 1633 units. To offset 1400 ghost units, I would normally add 1400 to mu_hat, but since current on-hand (165) already exceeds the required base stock for the next few periods, no new order is needed yet. I will set parameters to reflect the low demand regime and monitor for when the viable inventory (165 + 68) depletes.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P18-P21 avg: 34 units/week). Ghost inventory persists at 1,400 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262001 (Sports Tights) is in a clear low-demand summer regime (July). Average demand for the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is approximately 34.75 units/week. On-hand inventory is 132 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 4 weeks of demand at the current rate. The pipeline inventory is heavily inflated at 1468 units, but 1400 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10) are definitively lost based on historical lags well beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Only the order from Period 19 (68 units) is realistically in-transit. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 68 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1468 units and blocking all future orders, mu_hat must be adjusted to offset this 1400-unit 'ghost' inventory. I set mu_hat using the explicit method: (Expected Demand per period * (1+L)) + Ghost Inventory = (35 * (1+2)) + 1400 = 1505. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * std(P19-P22) \u2248 1.73 * 7.5 \u2248 13. L is set to default (2).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. We are in a low summer demand regime for sports tights. Average demand over the last 4 periods (P20-P23) is 27 units/week. Lead times for the most recent successful deliveries (P16, P18) were 1 period, though the promised lead time remains 2. Ghost inventory in the pipeline remains 1,468 units (P1: 415, P3: 296, P4: 382, P10: 307, P19: 68). The order from P19 is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining the group of failed shipments. Total viable stock is just the on-hand inventory of 117. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1,468 ghost units in transit, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=2 and mean=27, mu_hat = (3*27) + 1468 = 1549. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the pipeline inventory, allowing replenishment. Explicit sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the low but slightly variable summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Ghost inventory increased to 1,468 units (P19 - 68 units is now 4 periods overdue). Summer demand regime (P20-P23) stable at ~27 units/week.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. We are in a low-demand summer regime for sports tights. Examining the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand was 29, 33, 15, and 12, averaging approximately 22 units/week. The ghost inventory in the pipeline remains at 1,468 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19 which is 5 periods overdue). On-hand inventory is 105 units. At the current demand rate of ~22/week, 105 units cover roughly 4-5 weeks of supply, making a new order unnecessary. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,468 ghost units as available supply (which would result in zero orders even when stock is low), I use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to offset these ghost units. I calculate mu_hat as: (Desired Base Stock) + (Ghost Inventory). Base stock for (L+1=3) periods at 22 units/week is ~66 units. mu_hat = 66 + 1468 = 1534. This ensures the calculation 'base_stock - pipeline' (1534 - 1468) results in a target inventory level that respects actual on-hand needs. Sigma is set high to account for visibility/volatility in the return of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Ghost inventory persists at 1,468 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Summer demand regime (P21-P24) has dropped further to an average of ~22 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The product is sports tights, which are currently in a low-demand summer regime. Historical demand for the most recent 4 periods (P22-P25) averages 18 units/week (33, 15, 12, 12), showing a clear downward trend and stabilization at a very low level compared to earlier in the year. The inventory position is currently 93 units on-hand with 1468 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, the 1468 units in-transit (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19) are effectively lost/ghost inventory and will not arrive. However, with on-hand inventory at 93 and weekly demand at only ~18, the stock-on-hand is sufficient to cover approximately 5 weeks of demand. Given the promised lead time is 2 periods, no new orders are necessary. To ensure the OR backend doesn't order despite the ghost pipeline, I set mu_hat conservatively using the recent low-demand regime (N=4), which results in a base stock level significantly lower than current on-hand inventory, effectively suppressing new orders while we draw down existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P22-P25) stabilized at ~18 units/week. Ghost inventory persists at 1468 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the mid-summer demand regime for 'SUPREME tights'. Demand has stabilized significantly over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), with values of 33, 15, 12, 12, 13, averaging approximately 17 units/week. On-hand inventory is 80 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of current demand. The pipeline shows 1,468 units in-transit, but these from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19 are confirmed or highly likely lost (overdue by 4+ to 25 periods). To bypass the OR engine's logic that assumes this 'ghost' inventory is coming, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (Demand * (L+1)) based on the recent average demand of 17 and a lead time of 2. Target base stock = 17 * 3 = 51. Since the ghost inventory (1468) is subtracted from base_stock in the backend, I set mu_hat to 1468 + 51 = 1519. This ensures the backend calculates an inventory position near 0 or slightly positive, and since on-hand (80) already exceeds the current regime's needs, the capped policy will correctly result in 0 new orders, avoiding further holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-19. We are in a stabilized low-demand summer regime. Demand for the last 4 periods (P24-P27) was 12, 12, 13, 22 units, averaging ~15 units/week. This aligns with the seasonal profile for heavy sports tights in late summer. Ghost inventory remains at 1,468 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19 are confirmed lost/overdue). This 'In-transit' figure prevents the OR backend from ordering because it believes pipeline inventory is high. To trigger replenishment, I will use an explicit mu_hat that adds the ghost inventory (1,468) to the target base stock. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 15 = 45. Explicit mu_hat = 45 + 1468 = 1513. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to account for the current low volatility. L should remain at the default (2), though recent successful arrivals showed L=1, keeping it at 2 provides a more conservative buffer if supply chain volatility returns.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P24-P27) stabilized further to ~15 units/week. Ghost inventory persists at 1,468 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26 (late summer). The product (SUPREME tights) is in a low-demand summer phase, with the last 5 periods (P24-P28) showing a stable mean of approximately 14.8 units/week (12, 12, 13, 22, 15). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1,468 units remains comprised entirely of ghost inventory/lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19), meaning the pipeline is effectively empty. Since the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (base_stock - pipeline), I must continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to offset these 1,468 lost units. To calculate mu_hat: I estimate demand for the next L+1 periods (where L=2) using the recent mean (~15) and add the 1,468 offset. Calculation: (3 * 15) + 1468 = 1513. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=5 to capture the low volatility of the current regime. On-hand inventory is 43 units, which safely covers roughly 3 periods of current demand, so no immediate replenishment is triggered despite the offset, which is appropriate given the high holding cost and low demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. We are transitionining out of the summer low-demand regime. For the period P24-P29, demand has been very stable, averaging approximately 15 units/week. The current on-hand inventory is 27. The 'In-transit' pipeline is recorded as 1470 units, but based on historical tracking, 1468 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19) are definitively lost or indefinitely delayed 'ghost shipments'. To allow the OR backend to place a meaningful order and maintain stock for the upcoming autumn season, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value that incorporates a compensation for this 1468-unit pipeline inflation. I set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand + ghost_inventory = (1+2)*15 + 1468 = 1513. This ensures the base stock calculation (which subtracts the 1470 pipeline) doesn't result in a zero order. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the low volatility of the summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed ghost inventory is 1468 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Demand regime for late summer (P24-P29) stabilized at ~15 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand has stabilized at a low late-summer regime (P24-P30 avg ~15 units/week). Ghost inventory remains a critical issue; 1,486 units are 'In-transit' but 1,468 of these (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Only the order from P29 (2 units) and P30 (16 units) are potentially viable. To bypass the ghost inventory in the OR backend's capped base-stock calculation (where order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit), I must set mu_hat to explicitly include a 'bridge' value of 1,468 units plus the forecasted demand for the (L+1) periods. With lead time (L) at 2 and weekly demand at ~15, the target base stock should be ~45 + 1468 = 1513. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this replenishment and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as volatility is currently low.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. The demand for 'SUPREME tights' (sports tights) has followed a significant downward trajectory from the initial peak in early Spring (~350 units/week) to a very stable late-summer low (P27-P31 average is ~14.2 units/week). We are now entering mid-September, where demand for fitness/sportswear typically remains steady or begins a slight uptick as indoor sports season starts, but currently, demand is still at its floor. The critical OR challenge remains the 1494 units of 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P19). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation; to force a replenishment order when on-hand inventory is only 9 units, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and include an offset equal to the ghost inventory. Base stock calculation: (1+L)*demand + safety_stock. With L=2 and demand ~15, base stock is ~45. To overcome 1494 units of ghost inventory, mu_hat is set to 1540 (1494 + ~46). This ensures the OR engine places an order to cover the current cycle (~15 units) plus a small buffer, acknowledging that the pipeline units will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total ghost inventory increased to 1494 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and now P29 - 2 units overdue). Current demand regime (P27-P31) is steady at ~14 units/week. Artificial pipeline inflation requires mu_hat to be offset by ~1494 to allow replenishment.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for SUPREME tights is in a stable low-demand regime typical for late summer/early autumn, averaging ~14 units/week over the last 5 periods (P28-P32). The primary challenge continues to be 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 1,507 units, but analysis of history confirms that 1,494 of these are likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and now P29, which is 4 periods overdue). Specifically, P29 (2 units) has not arrived after 4 periods, while recent successful deliveries (P30, P31) arrived in 1-2 periods. To trigger the OR backend to order, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and include an offset equal to the ghost inventory (1494 units) plus the forecasted demand for the review+lead time. With L=2, the total window is 3 periods. Forecasted demand is ~14 * 3 = 42. Therefore, mu_hat = 1494 + 42 = 1536. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed performance of valid recent shipments (1-2 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed ghost inventory increased to 1496 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P29 - 2 units are now 4 periods overdue). Late summer demand regime (P28-P32) stable at ~14 units/week.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand for 'SUPREME tights' has stabilized at a late-summer/autumn low, with an average of approximately 11 units/week over the last 5 periods (P29-P33: 16, 8, 10, 12, 9). The 'In-transit' figure of 1515 units is severely inflated by 'ghost inventory' from failed deliveries: P1 (415), P3 (296), P4 (382), P10 (307), P19 (68), and P29 (2), totaling 1470 units. Physical in-transit inventory is likely only the orders from P32 (37 units) and P33 (8 units), totaling 45 units. To trigger the OR backend to order despite the 1515 units showing in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to cover the ghost inventory plus the expected demand for the (L+1) period (approx 1470 + 3 * 11 = 1503). Using 'explicit' for mu_hat ensures we bypass the pipeline inflation. L is set to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals show lead times of 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the low volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory total is 1470 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Sustained low-demand regime for late-summer/autumn (P29-P33) is ~11 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has stabilized at a low-demand regime for autumn, with the last 5 periods (P30-P34) averages 9.6 units/week. The product is sports tights, which may see a small uptick as indoor gym season begins, but there is no evidence of this yet. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 1515, but historical evidence confirms that orders from P1 (415), P3 (296), P4 (382), P10 (307), P19 (68), and P29 (2) are lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 1470 units of ghost inventory. Viable in-transit is only the P32 order (37) and P33 order (8), totaling 45 units. With on-hand inventory at 3, the total real position is 48. To bypass the OR engine's logic (which subtracts the full 1515 pipeline), I must set mu_hat to offset the ghost 1470 units. I am using an explicit mu_hat calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for ~10 units/week demand) + 1470. A safe base stock for L=2 and demand=10 is approx 40-50 units. Therefore, mu_hat = 1515 is appropriate to maintain recent ordering levels and prevent stockouts. I will use recent lead times (last 5 observations) to reflect the 1-2 period delivery speed seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory total is 1470 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Late autumn demand regime (P30-P34) is stable at ~10 units/week.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for SUPREME tights is in a sustained low regime, averaging ~8.6 units/week over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). Lead times are volatile: Period 30 took 2 periods, Period 31 took 1 period, and Period 32 took 3 periods. I will use L=2 (promised) to be safe. Pipeline inventory is currently 1478 units, but 1470 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Only 8 units (from P33) are potentially viable. To allow the OR backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that offsets the 1470 ghost units. The desired base stock for the current regime (avg 9, L=2) is approximately 27-35 units. Setting mu_hat to 1500 (1470 ghost + 30 buffer) ensures the (base_stock - pipeline) logic triggers a small replenishment or maintains necessary stock without being blocked by the non-existent 1470 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Confirmed ghost inventory total remains 1470 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Late autumn demand (P31-P35) has slightly decreased to an average of ~8.6 units/week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 680262001 (Sports Tights) is in a sustained low-demand regime. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is 6.6 units/week. Inventory is currently 38 units on-hand, which is significantly more than enough to cover several weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1470 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29), and should be ignored for replenishment logic. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with P32 and P33 both taking 3 periods to arrive. I will set L to 3 to be safe. Since on-hand inventory (38) is already >6x the current weekly mean (6.6), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-demand environment, while keeping mu_hat high enough to theoretically trigger an order only if stock were to fall below safe levels, and accounting for the ghost inventory inflation in the backend by not setting an explicit offset now, as current on-hand is sufficient.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a low level throughout the summer and into autumn. Over the last 5 periods (P33-P37), demand averaged 7.2 units/week. The product (sports tights) is likely in a seasonal low or end-of-life phase. 'In-transit' inventory remains at 1470 units, but these are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, and 29 that are long overdue and will never arrive. To allow the OR backend to place orders despite this artificial pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. With a promised lead time L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*8 + 1470 \u2248 1494. On-hand inventory is currently 30, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand, so the system likely won't order yet, but the offset ensures future replenishment is possible when on-hand stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for late autumn (P33-P37) has stabilized at ~7.2 units/week. Ghost inventory persists at 1470 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. The SKU (680262001) is a sports tight, which typically sees lower demand in autumn/winter compared to peak fitness seasons. The demand regime has consistently trended downward and stabilized; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 7.2 units/week. Ghost inventory remains a major issue for the OR engine: the 'In-transit' figure of 1470 units consists of lost shipments from P1 (415), P3 (296), P4 (382), P10 (307), P19 (68), and P29 (2). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds this ghost pipeline. I will estimate mu_hat using 'explicit' as (1+L) * mean_demand + total_ghost_inventory. With L=2 (promised) and mean=7.2, the target base stock is ~21.6 units. Adding 1470 units gives an explicit mu_hat of ~1492. Lead time is set to 'default' as recent arrivals (P32, P33) took 2-3 periods, aligning near the promised 2.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), the demand for SUPREME sports tights remains in a very low-demand regime, averaging approximately 7.2 units per week over the last five periods (P35-P39). The inventory position shows 15 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 1471 units. Based on historical data, 1470 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from failed or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Only 1 unit (ordered P39) is a valid incoming shipment. To circumvent the OR backend's logic, which would otherwise see the 1471 units and refuse to order, I must offset mu_hat by the amount of ghost inventory. I am setting L to 3 (the most recent observed lead time from P32/P33) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~30 units) plus the ghost inventory offset (1470), totaling 1500. This ensures the system maintains enough physical stock to satisfy the current low demand without being paralyzed by non-existent pipeline stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost inventory persists at 1470 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Late autumn/early winter demand regime (P35-P39) is stable at ~7.2 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Demand has been extremely stable in a low-demand regime for over 10 periods, with the average demand from P31-P40 being ~7.3 units/week. We have 9 units on-hand. The pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P29), totaling 1,470 units. These 1,470 units (1485 in-transit - 1 ordered P39 - 14 ordered P40) will never arrive. To bypass this, the OR parameter mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). Using a 3-period coverage (L=2) and a target service level of 50% (since Profit = Holding Cost), the desired base stock is roughly 3 * 7.3 = 22 units. Adding the ghost inventory of 1,470 units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1,492. This ensures the OR logic [max(base_stock - pipeline, 0)] allows for the necessary replenishment of valid stock without over-ordering. L is set to 'default' as recent arrivals (P32, P35, P36) have fluctuated around the promised lead time of 2.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a very low level for the late autumn/winter season. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 6.6 units/week. A significant volume of 'ghost inventory' (1470 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29) persists in the pipeline, which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. To allow for any replenishment, mu_hat must be set to a value that offsets this ghost inventory while accounting for the expected demand over the lead time. Given on-hand inventory is 6 and the ghost inventory is 1470, the backend calculates pipeline_inventory as 1470 + any recent orders. Period 40's order of 14 units is still in transit (legitimate). Total pipeline is 1484. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (ghost_inventory + forecast_demand * (1+L)) to trigger a small replenishment order if necessary, though current on-hand of 6 covers nearly 1 week of demand at the current rate. I'll maintain L=2 as the baseline, as recent arrivals (P39 order arrived in P41) align with the promised lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. The demand for the last five periods (P38-P42) has been consistently low, averaging 5.2 units/week (9, 6, 6, 4, 3), indicating a winter seasonal low for sports tights. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1488 units, but 1470 units are confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P29). Subtracting this ghost inventory reveals a real pipeline of 18 units (P40 order of 14, P42 order of 4). With on-hand inventory at 3 units, the current real stock (21 units) satisfies approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average. To counteract the 'ghost inventory' which prevents the OR engine from ordering (as it believes we are overstocked), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to the estimated real demand for the (L+1) period plus the ghost inventory offset (1470). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the loss of those 1470 units. Lead time is set to default (2), which is consistent with recent arrivals (e.g., P39 arrived in P41).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 1470 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Demand has further softened in early winter, with an average of ~5.2 units/week over the last 5 periods (P38-P42).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. We are in a stable early-winter demand regime with very low volume. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged 4.6 units/week (6, 6, 4, 3, 4). The 'In-transit' count of 1474 is significantly inflated by lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Period 1 (415), P3 (296), P4 (382), P10 (307), P19 (68), and P29 (2), totaling 1470 'ghost' units. To allow the OR backend to place orders despite this artificial pipeline, mu_hat must be set to include an offset equal to this ghost inventory (1470) plus the projected demand for the review and lead time. With a promised lead time of 2 and an average demand of ~4.6, the required base stock is approximately 14 units (3 * 4.6). Therefore, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' at 1484 (1470 ghost units + 14 units expected demand). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent volatility between 1 and 3 periods. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the low volatility of the current winter regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. Demand has remained consistently low for the early winter season, with an average of approximately 5-7 units per week. In-transit inventory is currently 1474 units, but 1470 of these are 'ghost' units from historically failed shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, 29) that will never arrive. The 4 units ordered in Period 42 are still within a reasonable delivery window given the observed lead-time volatility (1-3 periods). To counteract the OR backend's perception of 1470 units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that equals the true estimated demand over the lead period plus the ghost inventory (Base Demand ~6.5 * (L+1) + 1470). With L=2, (6.5 * 3) + 1470 \u2248 1490. This ensures the backend produces orders that maintain the 6 current on-hand units for the low-demand winter period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. The product is sports tights, and we are in a low-demand winter regime. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 4.2 units/week. Ghost inventory in the pipeline remains at 1470 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). These units will never arrive, but they prevent the OR engine from ordering because 'In-transit' (1480) is much larger than the desired base stock. To bypass this, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method: (1 + promised_L) * (current_mean) + ghost_inventory = (1 + 2) * 5 + 1470 = 1485. This forces the base stock calculation to slightly exceed the ghost inventory, allowing the system to place small replenishment orders. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed drift (average 2-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture low late-year volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains 1470 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). Winter demand regime (P41-P45) is stable at ~4.2 units/week. Delivery lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. This SKU (Supreme tights) is in a low-demand winter regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 3.8 units/week. Observed lead times recently have been 2-3 periods (P39: 2, P40: 3, P42: 3). The pipeline inventory of 1480 units contains 1470 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P29). To bypass the OR engine's logic which subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to the sum of the ghost inventory (1470) plus the required base stock for the current regime. With L=2, the required base stock is (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 3.8 = 11.4 units. Total mu_hat = 1470 + 11.4 \u2248 1481. This ensures the OR backend recognizes a need for replenishment despite the artificially inflated 'In-transit' figure.
