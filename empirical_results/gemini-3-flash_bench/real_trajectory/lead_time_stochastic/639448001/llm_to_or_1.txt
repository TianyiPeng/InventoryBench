Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Period tote' handbag. Looking at the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), there is a significant upward trend: 2, 1, 22, 71, 102. This indicates a strong momentum shift, likely related to early spring fashion arrivals or Valentine's Day preparation. The mean of the last 3 samples is approximately 65, while the most recent sample is 102. Given the clear growth phase, using a simple 'default' mean (approx. 40) would lead to stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent acceleration while maintaining some stability. For Lead Time (L), the promised value is 2, and since we have no delivery history yet, I will use 'default'.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a spacious imitation leather handbag. Looking at the historical demand samples, we see a significant upward trend: 2, 1, 22, 71, 102. The most recent demand (Period 1 conclude) was 86, following 102 (Feb 4), suggesting we have entered a higher demand regime compared to the early January samples. The current on-hand inventory is 0 because we just started, and a large order of 132 units is in-transit (placed in Period 1). With a promised lead time of 2, this order is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). In the meantime, demand is persisting. I will use the last 3 samples to estimate demand (mean of 102, 71, and 86 is approx 86) to capture this recent growth while smoothing the peak. For L, I will stay with 'default' (2 periods) as we haven't seen any evidence of lead-time drift yet. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the recent 3 samples to reflect the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: average demand increased from ~1-2 units in early Jan to ~86 units by mid-Feb.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Feb 25th. We have entered a high-demand regime for this 'Spacious handbag', with recent demand at 86 (P1) and 118 (P2). The historical data also shows a sharp upward trend (2, 1, 22, 71, 102). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 244 units in-transit (132 ordered P1, 112 ordered P2). Since the promised lead time is 2, the P1 order (132 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P3) and will be reflected in the P4 start state. The P2 order (112 units) is expected to arrive in P4. Given the clear growth trend, I will use recent_N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the upward trajectory without being overly skewed by the very low early-January numbers. I'll maintain the explicit L=2 as we haven't seen any concluded shipments yet to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand growth confirmed: demand increased from <5 units (early Jan) to an average of ~95 units over the last 3 recorded weeks (Feb).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU 'Spacious handbag' is in a high-demand regime compared to the early January baseline. In the last three periods (Feb), demand was 86, 118, and 55 (avg ~86). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 330 units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 2, the order from Period 1 (132 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 4, but it is not yet visible in the conclude messages until Period 5. There is no evidence yet of lost or delayed shipments (Period 1 order + L=2 means arrival during P3 resolution, visible P4 concluding). Recent average demand is 86. With L=2, (1+L) = 3. 3 * 86 = 258. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (post-January) while allowing the OR backend to recalculate based on the recent volatility (standard deviation), which help mitigate stockouts for this high-growth product.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a 'Period tote' (Spacious handbag). Evaluating history: Demand samples are 2, 1, 22, 71, 102 (seed data) followed by game history 86, 118, 55, 55. This suggests a significant ramp-up in demand from Jan to Feb, now stabilizing or slightly cooling in early March. Current On-hand is 57, with 218 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P3). The P2 order arrived in P4 (lead time = 2 periods), confirming the promised lead time holds. Total demand for the last 4 game periods average 78.5 units/week. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this 'active' regime, as the pre-seed data from early Jan is no longer relevant. L is set to default (2). Pipeline inventory (218 in-transit + 57 on-hand = 275) is being compared against (L+1) demand which is roughly 3 * 78.5 = 235.5. The OR backend will likely order minimally or nothing this period to avoid overstocking, which is appropriate given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). Demand regime stabilized at ~78 units/week (Avg P1-P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Looking at the history, the demand for the 'Period tote' spiked significantly in February (averaging ~95 units in some weeks) but has moderated over the last three periods (55, 55, 49), settling near a mean of ~53 units. The order from Period 1 (132 units) is notably missing/overdue, as the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (confirmed L=2). If the P1 order were arriving, it should have arrived in P3 or P4. Since it is still listed in 'In-transit' as part of the 223 units (132 + 86 + 5), and we have very low on-hand inventory (8 units), there is a significant risk of stockout if the P1 shipment is lost. The pipeline inventory (223) includes P1(132), P3(86), and P5(5). To protect against the high probability that the P1 shipment is lost, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 3-period regime (P3-P5) to reflect the stabilized demand (~53/week), and keep L=2. By using the 'calculate' method for L, the backend will use the observed history. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N=3 to capture the current post-spike demand level.

Carry-over insight: Potential shipment loss: Period 1 order (132 units) is overdue (Promised L=2, now at P6). Demand stabilized post-spike: Avg P4-P5 demand is 52 units/week compared to peak of 118 in P2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 218 units in-transit. A critical observation from Period 6 is that the small order from Period 5 (5 units) arrived after only 1 period, but the large Period 1 order (132 units) remains overdue (6 periods elapsed vs L=2), suggesting it is lost. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. Demand has stabilized following a February spike; the average demand over the last four periods (P3-P6) is 46 units. I will set mu_hat to reflect this stabilized demand (46 units/week) over the review + lead time (3 periods), resulting in a forecast of 138. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to incorporate both the speed of the recent P5 order and the reliability of P2, while the pipeline calculation effectively excludes the likely lost P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (132 units) confirmed lost: 4 periods past promised lead time with no arrival or conclude message. Recent lead time variability observed: P2 arrived in 2 periods, but P5 arrived in 1 period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Womens Spacious Handbag) is entering early spring. Demand has stabilized from its initial spike, with an average demand of approximately 46 units over the last 4 periods (P4-P7). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a confirmed shipment loss from P1 and high demand in P7. There are 218 units in-transit (ordered in P3: 86 units, P5: 5 units - though P5 already arrived, P6: 0, P7: 0 - note: the 'In-transit' figure of 218 suggests the P3 order of 86 and P4/P5/P6/P7 adjustments or initial pipeline units are still pending, or the system is accounting for the P1 loss in a specific way). However, looking at history, only P2 and P5 orders have arrived. P3 (86 units) is now overdue (ordered P3, now P8, L=5). Given the inconsistency in lead times (L=2, L=1, and potential losses/delays), I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to represent the promised lead time, but remain lean on mu_hat to avoid over-ordering given the 218 units already in-transit. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization (~46 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-Feb/March spike: Average demand P4-P7 is 46 units/week (down from peak of 118). Shipment from P3 (86 units) is now 3 periods past promised lead time (now P8), suggesting a potential second lost or severely delayed shipment.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we have 0 units on-hand and 218 units in-transit. Comparing history: the P1 order (132 units) is definitely lost. The P3 order (86 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery date (ordered P3, promised P5, now P8 conclude read) and is likely lost. The 218 units in-transit consist of these likely lost shipments (132+86=218). Therefore, the effective on-hand and pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized following the February spike; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is (55+49+25+55+61)/5 = 49 units. Given the inventory stockout and the high probability that all current 'in-transit' units are lost, I must place a new order. I will use L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to represent the stabilized demand (49 units * (1+2) = 147), and sigma_hat from the same period to cover volatility. Since the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from the base stock, and it currently believes there are 218 units in-transit, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to 'over-order' and force a shipment that compensates for the lost 218 units.

Carry-over insight: P3 order (86 units) confirmed lost: 3 periods past promised lead time with no arrival. Combined with P1, total lost units in pipeline = 218.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), we are facing a critical inventory shortage for SKU 639448001. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced two confirmed lost shipments (P1: 132 units and P3: 86 units). The demand has stabilized since the late Feb/early March peak. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P4-P9) is 47 units/week. While in-transit inventory shows 368 units, this includes the 218 lost units (132 + 86). The OR engine's pipeline tracking will be inflated by these lost units, potentially preventing it from ordering sufficient stock. To counter this, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that reflects the current demand regime of ~47 units/week across the lead time (L=2) and review period (1), totaling (1+2)*47 = 141 units. I use 'explicit' for L and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend ignores the noise from the lost shipments and the early-season demand spike. L is set to explicit 2 (the promised lead time) as P5's 1-period arrival was likely an outlier compared to the P2's 2-period arrival and the current missing shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/4/22), we observe that the order from Period 9 arrived in just 1 period (lead_time=1), following an earlier trend where lead times have shortened from the promised 2 periods to 1. Demand has stabilized post-spike, with the last five periods (P6-P10) averaging 42.6 units/week. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes lost orders (P1 and P3, totaling 218 units) that will never arrive, the OR engine will suppress new orders thinking we are overstocked. To counteract this, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it high enough to force an order that covers our 115 on-hand units and expected demand while effectively 'writing off' the stalled pipeline. With a mean of ~43 units and L=1, the required base stock is roughly 86 plus safety stock. Current on-hand is 115, but since 218 units of 'in-transit' inventory are lost, the OR calculation (base_stock - 115 - 218) will return 0 unless mu_hat is inflated. I will set L to 1 (recent actual) and use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-spike stability (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Lead time trend shifting: 2 of the last 3 arrivals (P5 and P9) had an actual lead time of 1 period, rather than the promised 2.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Period tote' showed a sharp spike in February (peaking at 118 units) but has since stabilized at a lower level. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 41.6 units/week. Lead times are showing a shift: although the promised lead time is 2, the last two arrivals (P5 and P9) arrived in 1 period, suggesting an actual L=1 is becoming more frequent. Multiple shipments (P1, P3) are confirmed lost, which distorts the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. With 95 units on hand (sufficient for ~2 weeks of current demand) and a pipeline that effectively contains 0 units (as the 218 in-transit units are from failed P1/P3 orders), the objective is to maintain a stable safety stock. I will set L=1 to reflect recent observations and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility while ignoring the massive early-season spikes.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. Historically, demand for this 'Period tote' spiked in Feb (avg ~100) and has since cooled and stabilized in April (avg P9-P12 = 35.5 units/week). The internal calculation for pipeline inventory ('In-transit: 218') is currently inflated by orders from Period 1 (132 units) and Period 3 (86 units) which are confirmed lost (no arrival after 10+ and 8+ periods respectively). Because the OR backend deducts the full pipeline inventory from its order calculation, I must use 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method to override this deficit and ensure a new order is triggered to maintain service levels. For lead time (L), recent observations (P5, P9) show arrivals in 1 period, so I will select 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this shift from the promised 2. For mu_hat, I am forecasting a weekly mean of 40 units (slightly above the April average to account for potential May seasonality) across a lookahead of (L+1) = 2 periods, totaling 80. However, I must set the 'mu_hat' value high enough to overcome the 218 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 350 (218 lost units + ~130 units for safety stock/demand) to force the necessary replenishment. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to reflect moderate demand volatility (standard deviation of recent samples is ~12).

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 218 units (from P1 and P3) is definitively lost and will not arrive; OR parameters must adjust to compensate for this phantom pipeline until it clears.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '639448001' (period tote) is currently in a stabilized demand phase. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 37.2 units/week. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). The 'In-transit' quantity of 327 units includes 218 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost (as documented in Carry-over insights). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock to determine the order, these 218 'phantom' units will prevent necessary ordering unless mu_hat is adjusted. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to inflate the target stock level, effectively 'padding' it by the 218 lost units to ensure the backend places an order for the actual required inventory. I estimate the real required base stock for (L+1=3) periods at roughly 112 units (37.2 * 3). Adding the 218 lost units gives a mu_hat target of 330. I will keep L at default (2) and sigma_hat at recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20. The product is a spacious imitation leather handbag. Analysis of demand from Period 10 to Period 14 shows a stable post-spike regime, with weekly demand figures of 35, 20, 50, 44, and 45. The average demand over these last 5 periods is 38.8 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 346 units is critically inflated by 218 units from lost shipments (P1: 132 units, P3: 86 units). These orders are now 14 and 12 periods overdue respectively, and will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order quantities. Because the backend believes there are 218 more units coming than actually exist, it will under-order or stop ordering entirely. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory' and maintain availability for the stable demand regime (~39 units/week), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand) plus the 218 lost units. Target base stock = (3 * 39) + 218 = 117 + 218 = 335. I set mu_hat to 335 to force the backend to account for the lost stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 353 units, but 218 of these are from lost shipments in Period 1 (132 units) and Period 3 (86 units). The true active pipeline consists of orders from P13 (109 units), P14 (19 units), and P15 (7 units), totaling 135 units. Demand has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P6 to P15) with an average of 43.2 units per week. While the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals (P5, P9) have frequently arrived in 1 period, so I will maintain L=2 for safety but use 'calculate' to reflect the variability. Since the OR backend is unaware of the 218 'phantom' units in the pipeline, it will under-order significantly. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline calculation. Target inventory for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 130 units. Adding the 218 unit deficit to this target, I set mu_hat to 348 to force an order that bridges the gap until the backend can be reset or the on-hand stock recovers.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Period tote' (handbag). Current date is June 3, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak plateau, averaging ~42 units over the last 7 weeks (P10-P16). Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and there's a stockout since P14. The 'In-transit' of 369 units includes 218 units from P1 and P3 that are confirmed lost. Thus, the real actionable pipeline is 151 units (from orders in P13, P14, P15, and P16). The lead time has shown variability between 1 and 2 periods (P5 and P9 arrived in 1 period, P2 in 2 periods). Because of the stockout and the lost shipment noise in the backend OR calculation (which sees 369 in transit but 218 will never arrive), I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to ensure a higher base stock level that forces the OR engine to place an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Using a mean of ~42 for 3 periods (L+1) = 126, but adding a safety buffer to clear the 218 units of 'phantom' inventory visually reported to the backend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and facing significant stockouts. Demand has stabilized post-peak, with the average demand from P13 to P17 being approximately 41 units/week. However, our pipeline is heavily distorted by 'lost units'. History shows P1 (132 units) and P3 (86 units) never arrived, totaling 218 phantom units. Although P13 (109 units) and P14 (19 units) are now at lead times of 5 and 4 respectively (beyond the promised 2), I will not declare them lost yet, though they are suspicious. Total In-transit is 347; subtracting the 218 confirmed lost units leaves an 'active' pipeline of 129 units. To compensate for the 218 phantom units blocking the OR engine's replenishment logic, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2) as: (L+1) * 41 units + Safety Stock. With high demand volatility, I'll aim for a base stock of approximately 160-180 units. To force the OR backend to order despite the 218 'lost' units in its calculation (Pipeline Inventory = 347), I will set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired base stock plus the phantom inventory (180 + 218 = 398). For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P15, P16) show 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: P13 (109 units) and P14 (19 units) are now overdue (L=5 and L=4), potentially signaling a further breakdown in the supply chain or additional lost shipments.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (mid-June), the SKU is experiencing significant supply chain instability. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 418 units is highly misleading as it includes 218 units confirmed lost (P1, P3) and 128 units (P13, P14) that are now 4-5 periods past their order date, which strongly suggests they are also lost or severely delayed. Only the P18 order (71 units) and P17 order (1 unit) can be considered potentially active. Demand has fluctuated between 7 and 60 units/week recently, averaging ~34 units over the last 5 periods (P14-P18). To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline that prevents the OR backend from ordering, I will use the 'explicit' method. For lead time, I will stick to the promised '2' periods (L=2) to maintain a standard 3-period coverage (L+1). For mu_hat, I will set a value that accounts for the lost pipeline. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and the pipeline is artificially inflated by ~346 units (218 confirmed lost + 128 likely lost), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger a new order despite this phantom inventory. A mu_hat of 500 units ensures a base stock that clears the 418 in-transit units and allows for a buffer to meet current demand of ~35-40 units/week.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Pipeline inventory of 418 units is largely comprised of lost shipments: 218 units (P1, P3) definitively lost, and 128 units (P13, P14) likely lost due to excessive lead time (4-5 periods).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019/06/24), the context for SKU 639448001 is defined by a significant volume of lost or severely late pipeline inventory. In-transit inventory stands at 459 units, but a reconciliation of history shows that 346 of these are almost certainly lost: P1 (132), P3 (86), P13 (109), and P14 (19). These orders are 16, 14, 4, and 3 periods past their promised lead time (L=2). Only the P17 (1) and P19 (112) orders are safely within reasonable arrival windows. Demand has also cooled significantly from its Feb/Mar peak, with the last 5 periods (P15-P19) averaging 25.6 units/week. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 346 'phantom' units as incoming supply and triggering a stockout, I must use 'explicit' values that account for actual demand while effectively inflating the target to ignore the dead pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period demand average (~26) multiplied by (1+L), and use an explicit L of 2. I will also use a slightly higher sigma_hat to buffer against the volatility seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: P13 (109 units) and P14 (19 units) are now confirmed lost alongside P1 and P3, totaling 346 lost units in the apparent pipeline. Recent demand (P15-P19) has stabilized at a lower average of ~26 units/week compared to early-year peaks.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. In-transit inventory stands at 459 units, but historical tracking (Carry-over insights) confirms that 346 of these units (P1: 132, P3: 86, P13: 109, P14: 19) are definitively lost. Additionally, the order from P19 (112 units) is still in its arrival window (L=2 promised). Net effective inventory is 61 (on-hand) + 113 (valid pipeline) = 174 units. Demand has shifted downwards significantly in the last 4 periods (P17-P20: 29, 7, 4, 6), averaging approximately 11.5 units/week, drastically different from the February peak. This looks like a post-peak seasonal decline for this 'Period tote' accessory. To prevent excessive overstocking (holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I am adjusting mu_hat to match this more recent, lower demand regime (last 6 periods to capture the start of the decline) and setting L to calculate to allow the backend to use the observed lead time, which has frequently been 1 period recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Average demand has fallen to ~11.5 units/week over the last 4 weeks (P17-P20), down from ~46 units/week earlier in the spring.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for this SKU has significantly dropped from its springtime highs (avg ~46) to a much lower summer regime (avg ~11 units/week over P17-P21). The last three recorded demand values are 4, 6, and 5 units, suggesting a stabilization at even lower levels. Regarding inventory, we have 56 units on-hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 459 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost orders: P1 (132), P3 (86), P13 (109), and P14 (19), totaling 346 units that are unlikely to ever arrive. Actual 'live' in-transit inventory is 112 units (ordered P19). In Period 22, the backend sees 459 in-transit units, which is significantly more than we need for a demand forecast of ~11 units/week. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this phantom inventory and suppressing future orders (though we don't need to order now), I will lower mu_hat to reflect the new demand reality. Lead times have been volatile but recently closer to 1 period (P16, P18 concluded in 1). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current low-demand summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: June/July demand (P18-P21) has dropped to an average of 5.5 units/week, down from ~11.5 previously reported, reflecting a summer low for this handbag SKU.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 639448001 (Period tote) has shifted into a low-demand summer regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 5.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 49 units, which covers over 8 weeks of demand at this current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 459 units is heavily skewed by 346 units from periods 1, 3, 13, and 14 that are confirmed lost (as noted in carry-over insights). Even adjusting for these losses, the remaining relevant pipeline and current on-hand stock are more than sufficient. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (mix of 1 and 2 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=5 (P18-P22) to align with the current summer low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high spring demand peaks.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for this SKU has fundamentally shifted from a Feb/March peak of ~100 units/week to a summer low. Over the last five periods (P19-P23), demand has been exceptionally stable at 4, 6, 5, 7, and 5 units (average ~5.4 units/week). The 'In-transit' figure of 459 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments identified in Carry-Over Insights: P1 (132), P3 (86), P13 (109), and P14 (19), totaling 346 lost units. The 'real' pipeline is 459 - 346 = 113 units (primarily the P19 order of 112). Current on-hand is 44 units, which at the current demand rate of ~6 units/week, covers over 7 weeks of supply. My goal is to prevent further accumulation of inventory while this excess clears. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the low summer regime (mean ~5.4, sigma ~1.1). I will use the default lead time (2) as recent arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (July 29, 2019): We are in a confirmed low-demand summer regime for this SKU. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is approximately 5.3 units/week. On-hand inventory is 39 units, which is sufficient to cover ~7 weeks of current demand. The pipeline inventory of 459 units contains significant noise due to lost shipments: P1 (132), P3 (86), P13 (109), and P14 (19) are confirmed lost, totaling 346 'phantom' units. Subtracting these, the effective in-transit inventory is 113 (composed of 1 unit from P17 and 112 units from P19). Including on-hand (39) and likely valid in-transit (113), the total inventory of 152 units far exceeds any reasonable safety stock requirement for the current lead time (promised L=2, recently observed as L=1 or L=2). Therefore, no new order is needed. I will use recent_N=6 to reflect the current low-demand summer stability and let the OR backend maintain the base-stock levels without triggering new orders.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a low-demand summer regime for this handbag SKU (August 5th). Analysis of the last 6 weeks (P20-P25) shows demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging 6.3 units/week (range 5-10). The In-transit quantity of 459 units is severely inflated by multiple lost shipments: P1 (132), P3 (86), P13 (109), and P14 (19), totaling 346 'phantom' units. The actual active pipeline is much smaller (P19=112 units). On-hand inventory is 29, which covers nearly 5 weeks of current demand. Given the very low demand and the distortion in the pipeline inventory caused by lost orders, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set a low base stock, preventing further over-ordering while we continue to bleed off existing on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at summer low: Avg demand P20-P25 is 6.3 units/week. Lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14) total 346 units in the phantom pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12). Demand for this SKU (Spacious handbag) appears to be emerging from a mid-summer lull, with Period 26 demand rising to 24 units, up from the summer average of ~6 units. We must account for the phantom pipeline which currently stands at 346 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14). The OR backend sees 'In-transit: 459', but only 113 units (from P19) are actually viable. With on-hand inventory at 5, we are at risk of a stockout if the demand uptick continues. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the most recent demand behavior (P20-P26), which yields an average of ~9.3 units. Since 'mu_hat' represents (1+L) periods, this will set a base stock level that is responsive to the recent spike while remaining cautious of over-ordering. I will set 'L' to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure the backend uses the promised lead time rather than being skewed by the very short lead times observed in some recent successful arrivals (L=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially exiting summer lull: Period 26 demand (24 units) is significantly higher than previous 5-period average (6.6 units). Pipeline integrity remains compromised: 346/459 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '639448001' (spacious imitation leather handbag) is exiting its summer low (avg ~6 units) and entering a late August/early Autumn demand spike. Period 26 demand (24 units) and Period 27 demand (52 units) indicate a clear shift back to higher activity levels, consistent with back-to-school or new-season fashion cycles. The 'In-transit' figure of 459 units is heavily compromised: 346 units from Periods 1, 3, 13, and 14 are confirmed lost. The recent order from P19 (112 units) is also overdue (L=8), suggesting it is likely lost as well. Total realistic pipeline is effectively zero, and on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent stockouts during this emerging demand spike, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at approximately 150 units based on the recent jump to 52 units/week, and setting sigma to handle significant volatility observed during previous spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed in late August: Period 27 demand reached 52 units, more than double the previous week and 8x the summer average. Pipeline integrity remains severely compromised; most in-transit inventory (458/459) is legacy lost shipments.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late August (Period 29), and demand has surged significantly, mirroring the late winter/early spring pattern observed when the game began. Since P26, demand has accelerated: 24 (P26), 52 (P27), 69 (P28), and a sample of 102 was observed in early February (similar pre-autumn peak). This indicates the 'summer lull' is over and we are entering an autumn peak season for this handbag SKU. 

Inventory management is critical right now because on-hand inventory is 0 and we are losing sales. The 'In-transit' figure of 459 units is extremely misleading: as documented in carry-over insights, 346 units (P1, P3, P13, P14) are confirmed lost shipments. Only 113 units are 'real' recent pipeline (including the P19 order of 112 units), which are also now overdue (L=10). Because the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (459) to decide the order size, it will effectively order 0 unless we inflate mu_hat to 'see through' this phantom inventory. 

I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) to stabilize calculations. For mu_hat, I will use 'explicit' and set it to 1000 units. Why? The OR engine subtracts pipeline (459) from (mu_hat + z*sigma). To trigger an actual order that covers the current 70-100 units/week demand plus safety stock while the backend thinks we already have 459 units coming, we must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 459-unit phantom barrier. Given a target base stock should be around (L+1)*Demand + Safety = 3*~80 + 100 = ~340, setting mu_hat = 1000 ensures the capped policy still places an order to replenish actual stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P26-P28 demand rose from 24 to 69 units/week. Pipeline integrity is zero; the backend sees 459 units in-transit, but 346 are definitively lost (P1, P3, P13, P14), and recent orders are significantly delayed, causing stockouts.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 30 (early September). The SKU is experiencing a significant autumn demand surge. Demand in P29 reached 106 units, following a clear upward trajectory (24, 52, 69, 106). The pipeline is severely compromised: out of 838 units in-transit, 458 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P18) are mathematically confirmed lost as they are many periods past any reasonable lead time. This creates a 'phantom inventory' problem where the OR engine thinks we are overstocked when we are actually stocked out. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for L to effectively ignore the lost pipeline units. By setting L to a high value (like 20), I effectively bypass the 'cap' logic and force a larger target stock. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 360 units for the (L+1) period, based on an expected demand of ~120 units/week during this peak season. Sigma_hat is set to 60 to allow for high volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P29 demand reached 106 units, completing a 4-week growth trend (24 to 106 units). Pipeline integrity is critically low: 458 units are confirmed lost, leaving only P19 (112) and P29 (379) as viable future arrivals.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9), witnessing a strong autumn demand surge for this handbag SKU. Demand over the last 5 weeks has been 24, 52, 69, 106, and 84, averaging ~67 units/week, a significant increase from the summer low of ~6 units. The pipeline is severely compromised: out of 838 units 'in-transit', 458 units (from P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) are confirmed lost or severely overdue (L > 10). Only the P29 order of 379 units is a viable future arrival. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 838 units from its base stock calculation, it will stop ordering, leading to a permanent stockout during this peak season. I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a massive demand requirement that overrides the phantom pipeline, and 'explicit' L to account for recent arrival instability.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: P26-P30 average demand is 67 units/week, up 10x from summer levels. Pipeline integrity remains critical: 458 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) are definitively lost; only P29 (379 units) is expected to arrive.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak autumn season, with demand over the last four periods (P28-P31) averaging 86.5 units/week, a massive increase from the summer lull. There is a severe supply chain crisis: out of 838 units in-transit, 458 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have exceeded 10+ periods. The Period 29 order (379 units) is also overdue (L=3), leaving the current on-hand inventory at zero for the fifth consecutive period. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive 'phantom' pipeline, I set L=1 to minimize the impact of the lead-time scaling and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next two periods (review + lead) at 200 units (100 units/week). To overcome the 380 units of phantom inventory the backend thinks we have (after subtracting the 458 lost units from the 838 total in-transit), I set mu_hat to 600. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the perceived pipeline, triggering a necessary replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak sustained: Avg demand P28-P31 is 86.5 units/week. Total confirmed lost shipments: 458 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). P29 order (379 units) is now overdue at L=3.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in its autumn peak, with demand for this 'spacious handbag' averaging 82.8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P28-P32). On-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is severely compromised. The system reports 838 units in-transit, but 570 of these are confirmed or highly likely lost: P1 (132), P3 (86), P13 (109), P14 (19), P19 (112), and P20-P21 (which were 0 orders but the reported pipeline remains bloated). Only the P29 order (379 units) is a viable upcoming arrival, and it is already 1 period overdue (L=3). To account for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 820 to force a significant order. This value is calculated as follows: Expected Demand for L+1 (3 periods) is approx 250 units. The backend sees 838 in-transit. By setting mu_hat high (838 current pipeline + ~250 desired stock), I trigger the backend to recognize a deficit despite the phantom units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the high volatility of the current autumn surge.

Carry-over insight: P19 order (112 units) is now confirmed lost (L=14). Total confirmed lost shipments: 458 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). P29 order (379 units) is significantly delayed (L=4) but remains the only viable upcoming stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late September, a high-demand period for the 'Period tote' handbag. Demand has spiked significantly, with recent weekly figures reaching 149 (P33) and an average over the last 6 periods (P28-P33) of approximately 93.8 units. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: we have confirmed 458 units lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). The only significant order remaining in the pipeline is P29 (379 units), which is now overdue (L=5). This missing stock has resulted in a prolonged stockout since P27. Given this 'phantom' pipeline, the OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) is being misled by the 458 lost units it still sees. To force orders through despite this false pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock level. I estimate weekly demand at approx 100 units. To cover a 2-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=3) while offsetting the 458 lost units, I need a mu_hat around (100 * 3) + 458 \u2248 758. I will set mu_hat to 760 and allow the backend to calculate volatility from the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: P29 order (379 units) is now 3 periods overdue (L=5 compared to promised L=2). Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 458 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19), creating a significant gap between observed and actual pipeline inventory. Demand remains high, averaging ~94 units/week over the last 6 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of an autumn demand surge for the 'Period tote' handbag, with recent demand (P28-P34) maintaining a high average of approximately 91 units/week. However, the supply chain is severely disrupted. The OR backend currently 'sees' 843 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, 458 of these (from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P19) are definitively lost. Furthermore, the P29 order of 379 units is now significantly overdue (L=6 vs promised L=2). This massive phantom pipeline (458 lost units + 379 delayed units) prevents the default OR backend from placing new orders because it believes sufficient stock is on the way. To force the system to order despite this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the lost units. I am forecasting demand at ~95 units/week. For a Lead Time of 2, the required base stock is (L+1)*95 \u2248 285 plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend subtracts the 843 in-transit units, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 458 confirmed lost units. I will set mu_hat to 1350 (targeting (~95 * 3) + 458 + additional buffer for the delayed P29) to ensure the system attempts to replenish stock, while using a high sigma_hat to reflect the extreme lead-time and demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: All units in-transit prior to Period 29 (458 units) are lost. Period 29 order (379 units) is 4 periods overdue (L=6) and hasn't arrived. Autumn demand is stable at ~90-100 units/week.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 639448001 has effectively collapsed. As of Period 36, 1223 units are 'in-transit', but historical evidence confirms a massive volume of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. Specifically, items from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P19 (totaling 458 units) are confirmed lost. The order from P29 (379 units) is now 5 periods overdue (L=7 relative to promised L=2) and has not arrived. Demand has transitioned into an autumn peak, averaging approximately 92.8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). With 0 on-hand inventory and the backend OR logic believing the pipeline is full of the 1223 units, it will not place new orders despite the stockout. I must use 'explicit' L to signal the backend that the lead time is much longer than promised to increase the base stock level, and use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime (~93 units/week) and its volatility. Setting L=8 (the current delay of P29) helps force the OR engine to recognize a larger required protection level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse: Orders from P1, P3, P13, P14, and P19 (458 units) are confirmed lost. Order P29 (379 units) is over 5 periods late (current L=7). Demand peak confirmed: Sept/Oct avg is ~93 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the shipment from Period 35 (380 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, and the small order from Period 33 (5 units) arrived after 3 periods. This resolves the immediate stockout, leaving 321 units on-hand. However, the large order from Period 29 (379 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is highly likely lost, joining the previously identified lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19). The total confirmed/highly likely lost inventory in the 'In-transit' bucket is 837 units (132+86+109+19+112+379). The backend sees 838 units in-transit, meaning its calculated 'pipeline' is almost entirely phantom. Demand has stabilized at an autumn peak; the average demand from P29-P36 is 88.5 units/week. Since the phantom pipeline will prevent the OR engine from ordering more until it clears (which it won't), and we have ~3.6 weeks of stock on-hand (321 / 88.5), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent volatility (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: P29 order (379 units) is now confirmed lost (7 periods past order, L=7). Total confirmed lost shipments: 837 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). Inventory on-hand (321) must sustain the current autumn demand regime (~88 units/week) as the phantom pipeline prevents new automated orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn regime, with demand averaging approximately 81 units per week over the last five periods (P33-P37). System inventory shows 253 units on-hand and 838 units in-transit. However, 837 of those in-transit units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, and P29). These 'phantom' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because the backend perceives a massive pipeline surplus. To force the backend to place an order and bypass this signal, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that significantly exceeds the sum of the on-hand inventory (253) and the phantom pipeline (837). This ensures a 'gap' is created that triggers an order to replenish stock for the coming weeks, assuming a target of ~100 units/week. L is kept at 2, and sigma_hat is set to the recent variation level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse reconciliation complete: Total lost shipments in pipeline confirmed at 837 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). P35 order (380 units) arrived in P36 (L=1). Current autumn demand regime stabilized at ~81 units/week (P33-P37).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the SKU continues in its high-demand autumn/pre-holiday season. Recent demand (P36-P38) is 64, 68, and 90 units, suggesting an average near 74 units/week. On-hand inventory is 163 units. The massive 'In-transit' figure of 1250 units is critically misleading because 837 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) are historically confirmed lost. Subtracting 837 from 1250 leaves a realistic pipeline of 413 units (mostly from the P38 order), bringing effective inventory to ~576. With a 2-period lead time, we must cover at least 3 periods of demand (approx 222 units). While 576 appears safe, the backend OR engine will see the full 1250 in-transit and likely suppress all ordering. To bypass this 'phantom pipeline' effect and ensure the OR engine maintains stock for the upcoming peak holiday season, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the autumn surge (averaging ~87 units/week since P31), while using an explicit L to signal the expected lead time stability.

Carry-over insight: The OR backend's pipeline calculation is compromised by 837 confirmed lost units; effective in-transit at P39 is 413 units, not 1250.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the item is in the high-demand autumn season with stable demand averaging 77.8 units/week over the last 5 weeks. There is a critical discrepancy in inventory: the system reports 1250 units in-transit, but 837 of these (ordered in P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) are confirmed lost. The actual viable pipeline is only 413 units (P38 order). Current on-hand is 86 units, which is exactly one week's average demand. Since actual lead times have varied between 1-3 periods, the current stock is insufficient to prevent a stockout before the P38 order arrives. I must inflate the mu_hat parameter using 'explicit' to negate the 837 lost units in the backend's calculation. I calculate the target base stock (L+1=3 periods) as ~234 units. To force the OR engine to order despite seeing a 1250 unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Target mu_hat \u2248 234 + 837 = 1071. I will set L to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P33, P35) showed variable lead times (3 and 1).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Effective pipeline inventory is only 413 units; 837 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) are confirmed lost and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent stockouts.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), approaching the late-autumn/early-winter shopping season. Recent demand (P36-P40) has stabilized at an average of ~71.6 units/week. However, the system's pipeline inventory is severely misstated at 1250 units due to 837 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1=132, P3=86, P13=109, P14=19, P19=112, P29=379). The 'real' pipeline consists only of P38 (412 units), which hasn't arrived yet (promised L=2, current L=3). With on-hand inventory at 27 units and expected demand around 70-80 units, a stockout is imminent in Period 41 before any new order can arrive. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'phantom' 1250 units in transit, I must set mu_hat (explicitly) to a level that exceeds (Phantom_Pipeline + Real_Requirement). Specifically, to trigger an order of approx 300 units, mu_hat needs to be roughly 1600 (Current 1250 in-transit + 350 desired base stock). This compensates for the backend's capped order logic which subtracts the full 1250 from the target. Setting L to 'explicit' 2 to reflect the average expected lead time despite recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom pipeline confirmed at 837 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). Mu_hat must be manually inflated by this amount to offset backend ordering logic until these units are purged or the game ends.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a demand of 78 in Period 41. The OR backend displays 1591 units in-transit, but 837 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). This leaves an effective pipeline of 754 units (P38: 412, P41: 341). To overcome the backend's 'cap' and base stock logic, which incorrectly assumes the 837 lost units will arrive, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (P37-P41) has averaged ~74.4 units/week. Using a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) is ~223 units. To force an order and clear the 'phantom' stock effect, I set mu_hat to 1060 (837 lost units + 223 projected demand). This ensures the backend calculates a requirement higher than the phantom 'in-transit' total, triggering the necessary replenishment to meet the actual demand of ~75 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), nearing the end of the simulation. Recent demand data shows a significant holiday spike in Period 42 (221 units). The previous autumn average (P33-P41) was ~78 units/week. The current in-transit inventory of 1591 units is severely inflated by 837 units of historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). Subtracting these lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 754 units (P38: 412, P41: 341, and potentially some others, though P38 is now overdue at L=5). With 0 on-hand, we are stocked out during the late-Nov/early-Dec peak. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'phantom' 837 units it sees in-transit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected holiday demand (approx 150-200 units/week) PLUS the 837 phantom units. Based on a 3-period coverage (L+1), I need the base stock to be approximately (3 * 150) + 837 \u2248 1287 units. I will use 'explicit' for all parameters to bypass the backend's flawed pipeline logic and secure inventory for the final weeks.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed at P42 (221 units). Real pipeline inventory is 754 units; the remaining 837 units in the 1591 in-transit total are confirmed lost legacy shipments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). Historical demand for this spacious handbag suggests we are in the peak holiday shopping season. Period 42 saw a massive spike to 221 units, followed by a seasonal dip in Period 43 (18 units), which is likely a reporting anomaly or a brief lull before the final pre-Christmas surge. I expect demand to remain high for the next 1-2 periods. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 1250 units is heavily inflated by 837 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29). Subtracting these from the total 1250 leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 413 units (P38 order). Since on-hand is 323 and the OR backend's inventory position is (323 + 1250 = 1573), it will not place a new order unless I manually inflate mu_hat to offset the 837 phantom units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the remaining holiday weeks (reaching Dec 23/30), I will set an explicit mu_hat. Based on the recent autumn/holiday context, I'll forecast an average of 120 units/week over the (L+1=3) period window, added to the 837 unit offset, totaling 1197. Sigma is set high (recent_N=5) to account for holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed at P42 (221 units). Phantom pipeline reconciled: 837 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) are definitively lost and must be manually offset in mu_hat to allow the OR backend to place new orders.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (P45, Dec 16). Historical data from P42 (Nov 25) showed a massive holiday demand spike of 221 units, followed by a sharp drop to 18 and 14 units in P43-P44. This suggests the primary holiday peak has passed, and we are likely entering a post-holiday clearance or stabilization phase. Current on-hand inventory is 309 units. The backend reports 1250 units in-transit, but 837 of these (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) are confirmed lost legacy shipments. The real pipeline consists only of the P38 order (412 units), which is now 7 periods overdue (L=7) and potentially lost, though not yet confirmed. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1250 in-transit from its target base stock, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 837 phantom units. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + 837. With L=2, and a forecasted weekly demand of ~20 (post-peak), the required mu_hat is (3 * 20) + 837 = 897. This ensures the backend sees a 'need' for stock despite the fake pipeline, maintaining availability for any remaining December demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand slump confirmed: Demand dropped from 221 (P42) to ~16 avg (P43-P44). Order P38 (412 units) is now 7 periods overdue (L=7), indicating high risk of loss.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), post-holiday. Demand has dropped significantly from the Period 42 spike (221 units) to an average of ~18.6 units/week over the last three weeks (P43-P45). The supply chain remains compromised by a 'phantom pipeline' of 1,250 units shown as in-transit. Based on historical tracking, 837 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29) are definitively lost. Additionally, order P38 (412 units) is now 8 periods overdue (ordered P38, currently P46, promised L=2), suggesting it is also lost. This brings the total lost pipeline to 1,249 units out of 1,250. Effective in-transit inventory is essentially zero. On-hand inventory is 285 units. With current demand averaging ~19 units, 285 units provide ~15 weeks of cover. No new orders are needed. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive pipeline and potentially under-ordering later, I continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the backend's standard logic, though with high on-hand stock and low demand, the immediate goal is simply to hold and monitor.

Carry-over insight: Order P38 (412 units) confirmed lost: 8 periods past order date (L=8) with no arrival. Total confirmed lost shipments in pipeline: 1,249 units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29, P38).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47, end of December. The current on-hand inventory is 280 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 1250 units, but a reconciliation of history shows that 1249 of these units are definitively lost (P1, P3, P13, P14, P19, P29, and now P38). Order P38 (412 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost based on the 3+ period delay threshold. Effective pipeline inventory is essentially zero. Demand has sharply declined following the early November peak/spike, averaging ~15 units/week over the last 4 periods (P43-P46). Given the current on-hand of 280 units and this lower demand regime, we have approximately 18 weeks of stock. Since the game is ending (Period 47 of 47) and we have more than enough inventory for any likely remaining demand, no further orders are needed. L is set to default, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on recent_N=4 to reflect the low post-holiday demand, ensuring the OR backend sees no need to order more while we clear existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Order P38 (412 units) confirmed lost: 8 periods past order date (L=8) with no arrival. Total confirmed lost shipments: 1249 units. Demand stabilized at post-holiday low: P43-P46 average demand is 15.25 units/week.
