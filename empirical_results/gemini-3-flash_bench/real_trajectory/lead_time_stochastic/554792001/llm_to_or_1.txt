Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 554792001 (Women's hip belt). Initial inventory is 0. Based on provided historical demand (7, 33, 28, 63, 45), there is a noticeable upward trend in demand as we move closer to the spring fashion season. The mean demand is 35.2 units/week with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the OR backend logic will target a base stock covering (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Since demand has been volatile but generally increasing (reaching 63 and 45 in the last two weeks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full historical context while acknowledging the recent growth. This helps the OR engine establish an initial safety stock for a product that currently has zero inventory on-hand and in-transit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a 'Womens Narrow belt in imitation leather', which is a stable accessory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 70 units; as L=2, these units are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and 29 units of demand were lost in Period 1 due to zero stock. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 7, 33, 28, 63, 45. The average demand is approximately 35.2 units per week. There is a slight upward trend, possibly due to post-holiday normalization or early spring fashion interest. I will set L to 'default' (2). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean demand (approx 35.2) while acknowledging the volatility. This results in mu_hat \u2248 (1+2)*35.2 = 105.6. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the recent variance (~20.4), bringing the backend estimate to sqrt(3)*20.4 \u2248 35.3. This approach ensures the OR engine aims for a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand while replenishing the safety stock and accounting for the lost sales in Period 1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 3 (2019-02-25), we are managing a women's hip belt. Recent demand samples show an upward trend: 7, 33, 28, 63, 45 (historical) followed by 29 and 47 (Period 1 & 2 observations). This averages to ~36 units/week. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (70 units) and P2 (64 units) are in-transit; the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 resolution (visible at start of P4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales (0 sold vs 47 demand in P2). To recover service level and account for the upward demand trend relative to the early historical data, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (approx 44 units/week) to cover the 3-period horizon (L+1). L is set to 'default' (2). Regularity in lead time cannot be confirmed yet as no orders have arrived.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Benny hip belt', a fashion accessory. Current date is March 4th. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show values like 7, 33, 28, 63, and 45. In the game history, demand for the last 3 periods was 29, 47, and 38. The mean demand across all 8 available data points is ~36.25 units/period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered in P1, P2, and P3. Per the lead time definition, the P1 order (ordered P1, L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of P4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 for SKU 554792001. This indicates the initial shipment is delayed or the actual lead time is longer than 2. We have 149 units in transit (70 from P1, 64 from P2, 15 from P3). On-hand is 0, leading to stockouts. I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the observed delay (setting L=3 as an estimate until arrival confirms otherwise). For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the available history (~36) scaled by (1+L). With L=3, mu_hat = 4 * 36 = 144. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). Current on-hand is 26, and we have 102 units in transit. Looking at the history, the order from Period 2 (64 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time 2), which matches the promised lead time. However, the order from Period 1 (70 units) has NOT arrived yet (expected in Period 3). This suggests the Period 1 shipment might be lost or significantly delayed. Demand history shows a steady increase: 7, 33, 28, 63, 45 (pre-game) and 29, 47, 38, 38 (game history). The mean demand over the last 5 weeks (including pre-game) is approximately 39.4. Given the item is a 'Benny hip belt' (Accessories), there is no obvious immediate seasonal calendar peak for March 11, but the demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial January observations. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this stabilized level (avg ~42) and default lead time parameters while keeping an eye on the missing Period 1 shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554792001 (Womens Big Accessories) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at history, demand has transitioned from initial high variability (samples 7 to 63) to a more stable recent range (33-47). The order from Period 1 (70 units) is missing\u2014it has been 5 periods since it was placed (promised lead time 2). This suggests the shipment is likely lost. The order from Period 2 arrived on time in Period 4 (2 periods). The orders from Period 3 (15 units) and Period 4 (17 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 conclude and Period 6 conclude respectively, based on the observed 2-period lead time. However, Period 5 conclude shows 0 units arrived, meaning the Period 3 order is late or lost. To compensate for the inventory gap and the likely loss of the Period 1 shipment, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 demand samples (including pre-game and history) to capture the current mean of ~42.6. With L=2, mu_hat becomes (1+2)*42.6 = 127.8. I am using recent_N (N=5) to ensure we are responsive to the current demand level while ignoring the very low first data point (7).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's belt. Historical demand (recent 5 weeks) shows an average of ~40 units (47, 38, 38, 34, 45). However, the initial 4 weeks' history provided in the prompt (7, 33, 28, 63, 45) suggests higher volatility. Currently, on-hand is 0 and we are missing potential sales. We have 121 units in transit from various periods. Looking at lead times: P4 concluded that the P2 order arrived in 2 periods (L=2); P6 concluded that the P5 order arrived in 1 period (L=1). The P1 (70 units) and P3 (15 units) orders have not yet concluded as arrived, suggesting they may be delayed or lost. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed performance, while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_5' to capture the current demand level (approx 40 units/week) multiplied by (1+L) periods of coverage.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554792001' (Womens hip belt) is currently facing high stockout rates with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand has been stable around 35-45 units/period (average ~39 since the game started, including the pre-game history avg of 35). The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have been inconsistent: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), Period 5 order arrived in 1 period (P6), and orders from P1, P3, P4, P6, and P7 are missing or pending. Specifically, the P1 order (70 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly overdue, suggesting it may be a lost shipment. Consequently, 'In-transit' reflects units that may never arrive (130 units includes P1's 70 units). To avoid persistent stockouts while accounting for this uncertainty, I'm using recent_N for both demand and lead time to captures current volatility. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised value) because 'calculate' would be skewed by the potential lost P1 shipment, and I want to ensure the base stock calculation covers at least the 2-period lead time window + current week demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8th, 2019. The product is a women's imitation leather belt. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 102 units in-transit. Looking at the history, some shipments have arrived (P2, P5, P6, P7), but notably the large order from P1 (70 units) and the order from P3 (15 units) are missing and likely lost, as it's been 8 and 6 periods respectively since they were ordered (promised lead time 2). The demand shows a consistent regime: recent samples [29, 47, 38, 38, 34, 45, 43, 37] yield a mean of ~38.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand forecasting (mu_hat) to capture this stable post-initialization pattern. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to incorporate the observed actual lead times (2, 1, 2, 1), which suggests an average closer to 1.5 than the promised 2. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (70 units) and Period 3 (15 units) are presumed lost as they are significantly overdue relative to the 2-period promised lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the product (Women's Narrow Belt) has stabilized significantly after an initial spike In late January. Over the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9), demand has averaged 39 units/week (34, 45, 43, 37, 36). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods. Critically, orders from Period 1 (70 units) and Period 3 (15 units) are lost. The total pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 126 units, but this includes the 85 units lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 41 units (17 from P4, 0 from P8, 24 from P9). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) window, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods of demand (avg 39 * 3 = 117) plus a buffer for the lost 85 units that the OR engine thinks are still arriving. By setting mu_hat to 202 (117 + 85), I force the backend to place an order that treats the lost 85 as non-existent. I will use a high sigma_hat (recent_5) to maintain a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: 85 units (P1, P3) confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is (In-transit - 85). Lead time remains variable (1-2 periods).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the product ('Benny hip belt') shows consistent but unmet demand due to inventory stockouts and lost shipments. Historical demand data from 2019-01-07 to 2019-04-15 shows a steady range (approx 25-63 units/week), with a mean of ~39. The current situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 178 units, but 85 units from Periods 1 and 3 are historically confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 93 units (from Period 10). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To maximize profit and recover service levels while accounting for the 'lost' units that the OR backend still thinks are in-transit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. A target base stock for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at a mean demand of ~40 would be ~120 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full 178 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered to cover the 85-unit deficit. I will set mu_hat to 210, which targets a base stock level sufficient to offset the 'ghost' pipeline units and meet the next 3 periods of demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '554792001' is out of stock. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 37.1 units over the last 11 periods. However, there are significant supply chain issues: orders from P1 (70 units) and P3 (15 units) are confirmed lost (85 units total). The current In-transit is 220 units, but 85 of those are lost 'ghost' units, leaving an effective pipeline of 135 units. These 135 units comprise the orders from P10 (76 units) and P11 (42) and likely a residual balance. Observed lead times have been 1-2 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the variability. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat to capture the post-initial-ramp demand behavior (avg ~37), and 'recent_N' with N=11 for sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 11-period demand mean while the OR backend's cap prevents over-ordering despite the visible high in-transit number caused by lost units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing a 'Benny hip belt'. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 35 units per week since February (historical mean ~ 36.6, recent 5-period mean ~ 31). Inventory is currently zero on-hand with 220 units in transit. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 85 units from early periods (P1, P3) are confirmed lost. The actual pipeline is comprised of: P10 (76 units ordered, 3 periods ago), P11 (42 units ordered, 2 periods ago), and P12 (0 units). Given the promised lead time is 2 but actual has fluctuated between 1-2, the order from P10 is now overdue and potentially lost or delayed. To ensure we recover from the persistent stockouts, I am setting L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable demand regime while being slightly more responsive than the full history. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. The OR backend will see (In-transit: 220), but since 85 are lost, it might under-order; however, with 135 effective units in transit against a base stock target usually around 120-130 for 3 periods of demand, the cap mechanism and pipeline subtraction should trigger appropriate replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Shipment from Period 10 (76 units) is now 1 period overdue (target LT=2, current elapsed=3); if it does not arrive by Period 14, it should be considered potentially lost, further reducing the effective pipeline from 135 to 59.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are managing a women's hip belt. Recent demand has cooled from a peak around early April, with the last period showing only 15 units. The historical average demand (including seed data) is approximately 35 units/period. Regarding logistics, shipments from Period 1 (70 units), Period 3 (15 units), and now Period 10 (76 units) are considered lost. Period 10's order is 4 periods old (promised LT=2), and the system 'conclude' messages confirm that P11 arrived on P13 (LT=2), skipping over the P10 order. The total 'In-transit' is 178, but 161 (70+15+76) are lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only 17 units (from Period 4 and Period 12/13 adjustments). With 27 on-hand, we are under-stocked relative to a (L+1)=3 week horizon (approx 105 units). I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a higher demand requirement to the backend, effectively bypassing its overestimation of the pipeline inventory caused by lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Shipment from Period 10 (76 units) is confirmed lost (4 periods elapsed, later orders have arrived). Total lost units in pipeline: 161 (70+15+76). Effective pipeline is (Current In-Transit - 161).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019-05-20), we are seeing a significant decline in demand for the Benny hip belt. The demand in the last two periods (P13: 15, P14: 13) is roughly half the mean previously observed. This may be due to the product lifecycle or seasonality as we move deeper into May. The supply chain has been unreliable: orders from P1 (70 units), P3 (15 units), and P10 (76 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 161 lost units. The current 'In-transit' of 178 includes these dead units, meaning only 17 units (178 - 161) are truly in the pipeline. With 14 on-hand and 17 effectively in-transit, we have 31 units to cover the next (L+1) periods. Recent lead times for arrived orders have been 1 or 2 periods. To account for the sharp drop in demand (detected regime shift starting P13), I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (P12-P14) to avoid over-ordering a potentially dying SKU. The OR engine will subtract the 178 units in-transit from the base stock. By setting lead time to a custom 'explicit' value, I can help the OR backend understand the coverage needed despite the pipeline inflation caused by lost orders. However, since the engine's cap is tied to L, and we need to order more to replace the lost 76 units from P10 while acknowledging the lower demand, I will set L to 1 to reflect the most recent arrival speed and use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~35 to ~14 (-60%). Pipeline remains contaminated with 161 lost units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P10: 76).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/5/27). Demand context: Demand spiked to 31 in Period 15 after a period of lower demand (~14), but the overall trend since P13 suggests a lower mean than the start of the year. Lead Time: Observed lead times are consistently 1 or 2 periods. Pipeline Status: In-transit is 178 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, 161 units are confirmed lost (P1: 70, P3: 15, P10: 76). These units remain in the backend's pipeline inventory calculation. To force an order, I must increase mu_hat significantly to overcome the phantom pipeline. Effective pipeline = 178 - 161 = 17 units. Current On-hand = 0. Demand for P16 is expected to be around 25-30 given the recent spike and seasonal category (accessories). To calculate the explicit mu_hat: Targeted Base Stock = Expected Demand * (L+1). With L=2, (L+1)=3. Targeted Base Stock \u2248 30 * 3 = 90. However, the backend sees 178 in transit. To trigger an order covering the next 3 weeks (approx 75 units), I set mu_hat = 178 (pipeline) + 75 (desired stock) = 253. This compensates for the 161 lost units effectively.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The product is a women's belt, and a significant demand regime shift was detected at Period 13, where average demand dropped from ~35 to ~18 (Period 13-16 demand: 15, 13, 31, 15). The pipeline is severely contaminated with lost orders: Period 1 (70), Period 3 (15), and Period 10 (76), totaling 161 units that will never arrive but are counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. Total In-transit is 275, but the effective pipeline is only 114 (275 - 161). To ensure the OR engine places an order to cover the (L+1) period demand despite these ghost units, mu_hat must be adjusted. With L=2, (L+1)=3 periods of demand at a mean of ~18/week equals ~54. Since we have 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 114 (which is already higher than the 54 needed), the OR backend likely won't order more if I set L/mu/sigma to reflect current reality perfectly. However, the system is at 0 on-hand and stockouts are occurring. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the lower demand regime while allowing the backend to use its standard lead time calculation. I will use explicit mu_hat to offset the ghost pipeline until it clears.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination continues: 161 units (P1, P3, P10) are lost. On-hand is 0. Recent demand (P13-P16) average is 18.5 units/period.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (2019/06/10), we are managing a Benny hip belt. The recent demand regime has shifted significantly downwards starting at Period 13; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 16.8 units/period, compared to the earlier average of ~35. In-transit inventory is currently 178 units, but history shows that 161 of these units are permanently lost (P1 from 70 units, P3 from 15 units, and P10 from 76 units). Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is 178 - 161 = 17 units. On-hand inventory is 87 units. While 87 + 17 = 104 units is well above the (L+1) demand coverage for the current low-demand regime (~16.8 * 3 = 50.4), the OR backend is unaware of the lost 161 units. To correct for this massive pipeline contamination, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at 17 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) is 51. I will set mu_hat to 51 + 161 = 212. This tells the OR backend it needs 212 units in total, which after subtracting the 'false' pipeline of 178 and the on-hand of 87, will correctly result in no new orders being placed while we bleed off the current 87 units of on-hand inventory. Sigma is set based on recent volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a women's hip belt. We are in a lower demand regime that began around Period 13; the average demand from Period 13 to 18 is ~17.8 units/period. The pipeline inventory (178 units) remains heavily contaminated by lost shipments from Period 1 (70 units), Period 3 (15 units), and Period 10 (76 units), totaling 161 lost units. This means the effective pipeline is only 17 units (178 - 161). Currently, on-hand inventory is 64 units. At the current demand rate, 64 units covers approximately 3.6 periods, which is more than the (L+1) coverage needed. The OR engine needs to recognize the reduced demand and the fact that most of the pipeline is non-existent. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~17.8) and 'explicit' for L to account for the frequent 1-2 period arrivals while recognizing the lost units issue. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent regime, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that likely prevents unnecessary ordering until on-hand inventory is depleted.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (2019/6/24), we face a stockout after a sudden demand spike (88 units) in Period 19. The 'In-transit' quantity of 178 units includes 161 confirmed lost units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P10: 76), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 17 units (from orders not yet delivered, though history shows many recent orders were zero). Looking at history, demand has shifted. The early mean (P1-P12) was ~36, then it dropped (P13-P18) to ~18, but Period 19 saw a surge to 88. This surge is likely seasonal or a clearance event. I will use a conservative recent window (N=7) for demand to capture this recent volatility while ignoring the early high-demand regime. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (mean ~1.5). I am choosing 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we order enough to overcome the 161 'ghost' units in the pipeline. The OR engine calculates: Order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). Since the backend thinks pipeline = 178 but effective pipeline = 17, I must inflate mu_hat by approximately 161 units to force the OR engine to place an order that actually reaches the shelf. Effective target for 3 periods (L+1) at ~30 units/avg = 90. Adding 161 lost units = 251. I set mu_hat to 250 to clear the phantom inventory bottleneck.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand spike detected (Period 19: 88 units), breaking the low-demand regime. Pipeline remains corrupted by 161 lost units (P1, P3, P10).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. We are observing a significant demand surge (P19: 88, P20: 50) following a low-demand regime. This matches the 'Benny hip belt' profile, which likely sees seasonal interest. Inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline remains heavily contaminated with 161 lost units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P10: 76). The total in-transit is 291, but the effective pipeline is only 130 units (291 - 161), consisting of the P16 order (97 units, already arrived P17) and the P20 order (113 units). Wait, examining the history: P16 (97 units) arrived on P17. Therefore, the current in-transit of 291 units contains: 161 (lost) + 113 (P20 order) + 17 (P4 order - if not arrived, also lost). Re-calculating: P1(70)+P3(15)+P4(17)+P10(76) = 178 units lost/stuck. Effective in-transit is 113. To compensate for the lost units and address the high demand (mean of last 3 periods is ~51), I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for the lead time (L=2) plus review period (1), which is (2+1)*51. I use explicit parameters to force the OR backend to ignore the phantom pipeline units and order enough to meet the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed total lost units in pipeline increased to 178 (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76). Effective pipeline is (Current In-Transit - 178). High demand regime confirmed: P19-P20 average is 69 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554792001' (Womens hip belt) is currently in a significant demand surge, likely due to summer seasonality or a fashion trend, as evidenced by a mean demand of 88.3 units over the last 3 periods (P19=88, P20=50, P21=127). The pipeline remains heavily contaminated with 178 units from older periods (P1, P3, P4, P10) that are confirmed lost. Total in-transit is 291 units, but the effective pipeline is only 113 units (ordered in P20). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a recent demand average of ~88, the OR engine needs to be pushed toward higher ordering to cover the (L+1) = 3 period horizon and account for lost stock. I set mu_hat explicitly to 265 ((1+2) * 88.3) and sigma_hat to 65 (sqrt(3) * 38) to ensure the target base stock level is high enough to generate replenishment orders despite the phantom in-transit units. Lead time is kept at the default 2 periods as recent arrivals (P13, P17) fluctuate between 1 and 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P19-P21 average demand is 88.3 units/period, compared to the P13-P18 average of 17.8. Total lost inventory in pipeline remains 178 units (P1:70, P3:15, P4:17, P10:76).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554792001' is in the midst of a significant high-demand regime, likely seasonal (mid-July). Demand over the last four periods (P19-P22) has been 88, 50, 127, and 113, averaging 94.5 units per period. This is a massive increase from the previous low-demand regime (P13-P18 avg: 17.8). Despite receiving a large shipment of 113 units in Period 22, the stock was entirely depleted due to high demand, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. The current pipeline shows 207 units 'in-transit', but historical analysis confirms that 178 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10) are lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore only 29 units (ordered in Period 22). To maintain a sufficient service level against a demand average of ~95, mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L) * 95 = 285 (with L=2). Since the OR engine subtracts the *total* in-transit (207) from the base stock, I must use an explicit mu_hat to 'pad' the order to account for the 178 ghost units. A mu_hat of 440 allows for (440 - 207 = 233) units to be considered for order, covering our needs for lead time + review period (~285-300 units) minus the effective 29 in pipeline. This targets an order around 200 units to restore stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge is sustained: P19-P22 average demand is 94.5 units/period. Total lost inventory in pipeline remains 178 units (P1:70, P3:15, P4:17, P10:76), requiring mu_hat compensation to ensure the OR backend orders sufficient replacement stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 554792001 (Women's hip belt) has shifted significantly upward starting around Period 19. The recent demand samples (P19-P23) are 88, 50, 127, 113, and 38. While Period 23 saw a drop to 38, the overall average of this recent high-demand regime is approximately 83.2 units per period, which is a major increase from the earlier average of ~18. The pipeline remains heavily contaminated with 178 units from lost shipments (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76) that will never arrive. To compensate for these 'ghost' units in the OR backend's calculation (In-transit), I must set mu_hat explicitly. My goal is to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units to force a replenishment order. Given L=2, (L+1) = 3. Using a forward-looking mean of ~85 for the high-demand regime, the expected demand is 255. Adding the 178 lost units gives a target mu_hat of 433. Sigma_hat is set to 60 to reflect increased volatility in this high-demand phase. Lead time remains consistent with the promised 2 periods (actual observed lead times have been 1-2).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 19. Demand in Period 24 was 93 units, consistent with the surge seen in the last 6 periods (P19-P24), where the average demand is approximately 84.8 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2. The pipeline is heavily contaminated with 178 confirmed lost units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76) that will never arrive but are still counted by the OR backend. To compensate for these lost units and the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. My target mu_hat follows the formula: (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost units. Using L=2, Forecast=85, and Lost=178, the calculation is (3 * 85) + 178 = 433. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains high (P19-P24 average: 84.8). Pipeline remains contaminated with 178 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Benny hip belt has entered a high-demand regime starting at Period 19. The average demand from Period 19 to 25 is approximately 82.4 units per period (sample: 88, 50, 127, 113, 38, 93, 68). The current date is August 5, 2019, which is a peak retail period. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 484 is significantly inflated by 178 lost units (from Orders 1, 3, 4, and 10), which the OR backend incorrectly views as 'pipeline inventory'. To force the OR backend to place an order that replaces these lost units and covers the current 3nd-period demand cycle (L=2, cycle=3), I must set an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Expected 3-period demand (L+1) = 82.4 * 3 = 247.2. To compensate for the 178 'phantom' units that will never arrive, I shift the target base stock upward. mu_hat = 247.2 + 178 = 425.2. sigma_hat is set based on the high-demand regime variance to maintain service levels during this surge.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: The SKU '554792001' (Narrow belt) remains in a high-demand regime that began around Period 19. Average demand over the last 8 periods (P19-P26) is approximately 85.9 units per period. The shipment from Period 23 (204 units) arrived in Period 26 after a 3-period lead time, which is longer than the promised 2 periods; however, the average lead time remains approximately 2. Pipeline health remains the primary concern: 178 units are confirmed lost (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76). These units remain in the backend 'in-transit' calculation indefinitely. With In-transit at 280, the effective pipeline is only 102 units (280 - 178), which matches the order placed in Period 24. To ensure the OR backend generates sufficient replacement orders for this high-demand period while accounting for the 178 ghost units, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value. Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast. Assuming L=2 and Forecast=86, base demand is 258. Adding the 178 lost units to offset the backend's overestimation of pipeline inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 436.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we face a stockout after demand reached 118 units in Period 27, confirming a sustained high-demand regime. Average demand from Period 19 to 27 is ~90.6 units/period, while the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) average ~98.6 units. The product is a women's belt, likely seeing high summer/back-to-school demand. Total lost inventory remains 178 units (P1:70, P3:15, P4:17, P10:76) which falsely inflates the OR engine's 'pipeline' view. Current in-transit is 388, but only 210 units are expected (388-178). To compensate for the 178 missing units and the high target service level (80%), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I use the recent 9-period average (~91) across the (L+1=3) window, plus a 178-unit replacement offset: (91 * 3) + 178 = 451. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the high volatility of this current regime. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance including recent 1-3 period variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Benny hip belt' has shifted into a higher regime starting from Period 19. The recent demand (P19-P28) averages 88.5 units per period, a significant increase from the mid-year slump. Currently, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline (In-transit: 497) is severely contaminated with 178 lost units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76) that will never arrive. The OR backend calculates the order as (Base Stock - Pipeline), so if we do not adjust parameters to account for these ghost units, the system will under-order, believing the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate for the 178 missing units within the OR logic, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+L=3 periods) PLUS the 178 lost units. Applying the recent high-demand average of 88.5 across 3 periods gives 265.5; adding 178 units of loss compensation results in 443.5. I will use 444 as the explicit mu_hat. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Maintenance of pipeline correction; 178 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) remain lost. High-demand regime (P19 onwards) average is ~88 units/period. Adjusting mu_hat to include pipeline compensation (178 units) to offset the OR backend's pipeline tracking.

The pipeline (In-transit: 497) is severely contaminated by 178 confirmed lost units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76). These units will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from its 'base_stock' calculation, causing chronic under-ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat to (1+L) * (average_demand) + lost_units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 84.6) + 178 = 431.8. I use recent_N=11 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility of this high-demand period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P19-P30) shows a significantly higher average of approximately 83 units per period compared to the earlier periods. Period 30 saw the arrival of P27 and P28 orders, bringing on-hand inventory to 170. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 280 includes 178 units from P1, P3, P4, and P10 that are long-lost. This means the actual effective pipeline is 102 units (P24 order). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 'phantom' units, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 178 lost units. Using L=2 (promised) and mean demand of ~83 units, the base mu_hat is 3 * 83 = 249. Adding 178 results in an explicit mu_hat of 427. This forces the engine to recognize the need for more stock. Sigma is set based on the recent high-volatility regime (N=12) to ensure a sufficient safety buffer.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has remained consistently high, though it appears to be stabilizing from its peak. The average demand from Period 19 to Period 31 is approximately 83 units/period, while the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) show a slightly lower average of 69 units. Given the transition into September, a moderate downward trend is observed. The pipeline is heavily contaminated with 178 units from orders placed in P1, P3, P4, and P10 that are long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' amount (302) when calculating the next order, and 178 of those units will never arrive, I must set mu_hat to include an 'explicit' compensation for these ghost units. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover real demand plus the missing inventory. I choose an explicit mu_hat of 387, calculated as follows: (L+1) * Recent_Mean + Lost_Units = (2+1) * 69.6 + 178 \u2248 387. This bridges the gap caused by the backend's inability to ignore lost shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33 (2019/09/23), the SKU 554792001 (Women's Narrow Belt) is in a post-peak demand regime. Since Period 19, demand surged but has recently moderated to an average of ~46 units/period (last 3 periods). The pipeline is severely corrupted by 178 lost units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76) which never arrived and likely never will. To compensate for the OR backend's belief that these 'lost' units are still coming, I must inflate mu_hat. The calculation is: (Actual Forecasted Demand over L+1) + (Total Lost Units). Recent demand N=3 (P30-P32) average is 46.3. Since L=2, L+1=3. Base mu_hat = 3 * 46.3 = 139. Total mu_hat = 139 + 178 = 317. This forces the engine to order replacement stock for the ghost inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (N=14) to capture the higher variance of the post-surge period.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Pipeline remains contaminated with 178 lost units. Recent stable demand post-surge (P30-P32) is ~46 units/period. Mu_hat must continue to include a +178 unit offset until the OR backend's pipeline inventory reflects reality.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554792001 is a 'Benny hip belt', a fashion accessory. Current demand has stabilized after an August peak, with recent demand (P30-P33) averaging approximately 50 units per period. The primary operational challenge continues to be the significant pipeline contamination: 178 units of the reported 'In-transit' inventory (287 units) are confirmed lost (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76). These units will never arrive, but the OR backend's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic treats them as incoming, which would normally cause it to under-order. To correct for this, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1) periods = 3 periods * 50 units/period = 150 units. We must add the 178 lost units back to this target to force the backend to place an order that replaces the lost stock. Total mu_hat = 150 + 178 = 328. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual arrival time (ranging 1-3 periods). Sigma is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current demand volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the SKU is 554792001 (Women's hip belt) entering October. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline is 300 units, but 178 of these are confirmed lost (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10), making the effective pipeline 122 units. Demand has trended upward again (P33: 61, P34: 72), following a period of stability around 46 units/period. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 54.4 units. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset to compensate for the 178 lost units that the OR backend still believes are in-transit. With L=2, (1+2)*54.4 = 163.2. Adding the 178 unit compensation results in 341.2. I'll use an explicit mu_hat of 341. Lead time remains variable but averages near the promised 2 periods, so I'll use the 'calculate' method. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the recent demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand shift detected upwards; average of P30-P34 is 54.4 units/period compared to previous 46. Pipeline contamination of 178 lost units remains constant.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P33-P35) averages 73.7 units/period (61, 72, 88), indicating a sustained upward shift compared to the P30-P32 average of 46 units. I am setting mu_hat based on an explicit forecast to account for both this demand increase and the persistent pipeline contamination of 178 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10). The OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) is skewed by these 178 phantom units that will never arrive. To force the backend to place an order, I must increase mu_hat by the amount of lost inventory. Calculating mu_hat: Expected demand for (L+1) periods = 3 * 75 = 225. Adding the pipeline correction: 225 + 178 = 403. This ensures the backend recognizes a deficit. Lead time (L) remains set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals show high variability (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: sustained increase to ~74 units/period. Pipeline contamination of 178 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10) is constant and requires mu_hat compensation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554792001 is currently in a high-demand regime, with P35-P36 seeing a surge (average ~107 units/period) following a previous stable period of ~54 units. As of Period 37, on-hand inventory is 0 and the current in-transit is 371. However, the pipeline is severely contaminated by 178 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10), meaning the effective pipeline is only 193 units (371 - 178). To force the OR backend to order sufficient stock despite its overestimation of pipeline inventory, I must adjust mu_hat to include a compensation for these 178 units. Based on the recent surge, I estimate demand at ~100 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+L)*100 = 300. Adding the 178 unit pipeline correction results in a total mu_hat of 478. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a period of significantly higher demand (Avg P35-P37: 114 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 523 units includes 178 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76) and an additional 102 units from Period 24 which are now 13 periods overdue and must be considered lost. Total lost units = 280. Effective pipeline is 523 - 280 = 243 units (Orders from P36 and P37). Since the OR backend cannot see these lost units, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to compensate. I estimate demand for the next (L+1) = 3 periods at 115 units/period (345 units) and add 280 units to the mu_hat to force the backend to 'replace' the phantom pipeline inventory. Total explicit mu_hat = 345 + 280 = 625. L is set to 'calculate' to account for recent lead time variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed total lost units in pipeline increased to 280 (P1:70, P3:15, P4:17, P10:76, P24:102). Effective pipeline calculation must subtract 280 from reported 'In-transit'. Demand regime remains very high, averaging ~114 units/period since Period 35.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime. Average demand from Period 35 to 38 is approximately 104.5 units per period. The pipeline is severely contaminated with 280 lost units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76, P24: 102). These units will never arrive, but the OR backend counts them in the pipeline inventory, which causes it to under-order. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. The target base stock for this (L+1) period should cover 3 periods of demand at a rate of ~110 units plus the 280-unit pipeline deficit. Calculation: (3 periods * 110 units/period) + 280 lost units = 610. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile 1-3 period actual lead time observed recently. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the high volatility of the current demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 89 units over the last 15 periods (P25-P39) and recent volatility (P36: 126, P37: 128, P38: 76, P39: 42). Current on-hand is 112, and In-transit is 495. However, there is significant pipeline contamination. As identified in Period 38, historical orders totaling 280 units (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76, P24: 102) are confirmed lost, as more recent orders have already arrived. Subtracting these from the reported In-transit gives an effective pipeline of 215 units. To compensate for the OR backend's overestimation of the pipeline (which would cause it to under-order), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * Expected Demand + Pipeline Offset. With L=2 and Expected Demand \u2248 100 (anticipating high-season volatility), the base stock should be ~300. Adding the 280 lost units to offset the backend's 'In-transit' count results in 580. This ensures the backend places an order that considers the 280 units as effectively non-existent.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Pipeline contamination remains at 280 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24). High-demand regime persists, though Period 39 showed a dip to 42; average demand remains high (~90-110).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-18. On-hand inventory is 74 units with 515 units reported in-transit. However, the pipeline is heavily contaminated with 280 lost units (P1:70, P3:15, P4:17, P10:76, P24:102), making the effective pipeline only 235 units. Recent demand has been volatile but generally high. The last 6 periods (P35-P40) show an average demand of approximately 83 units/period (88, 126, 128, 76, 42, 38), though the last two periods show a significant slowdown. To compensate for the 280 units the OR backend 'thinks' are coming but never will, I used the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Calculation: Target base stock (using L=2) covers 3 periods of demand. At a recent average of ~83 units/period, the forecast would be 249. Adding the 280 lost units as a buffer to force the backend to place replacement orders results in an explicit mu_hat of 529. Lead time remains variable (scheduled 2, actuals 1-3), so I use 'calculate' to average these experiences.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554792001 is currently in a state with 101 units on-hand and 460 units in-transit. However, the pipeline is heavily contaminated with 280 units of lost shipments (P1: 70, P3: 15, P4: 17, P10: 76, P24: 102). These units will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from the order calculation. Effective pipeline = 460 - 280 = 180 units. Lead time is consistently averaging 2 periods. Recent demand has stabilized significantly downwards after the P35-P39 high-demand regime; the last three periods (P39-P41) show demand of 42, 38, and 28 (Avg: 36). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this cooling. However, I must continue to inject an 'explicit' value for mu_hat to compensate for the 280 phantom units in the pipeline. Calculation: Target Base Stock (for L=2) = (1+L) * AvgDemand + SafetyStock. The OR backend calculates (Base Stock - Pipeline). To make it order correctly, I provide an explicit mu_hat = ((1+L) * AvgDemand) + 280. With L=2 and AvgDemand=36, mu_hat = (3 * 36) + 280 = 108 + 280 = 388.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Recent demand cooling confirmed (P39-P41 average: 36 units/period). Pipeline contamination remains at 280 lost units, necessitating continued mu_hat offset in OR parameters.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554792001 is currently in a cooling demand phase following a significant peak. The average demand over the last four periods (P39-P42) is 36.75 units/period, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~90-110 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this shift. The pipeline remains contaminated with 280 units of lost shipments (P1:70, P3:15, P4:17, P10:76, P24:102). These units are recorded as 'In-transit' but will never arrive. To ensure the backend OR engine maintains a sufficient physical base stock, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter by adding the volume of these lost units. This compensates for the fact that the backend subtracts the (contaminated) pipeline from its order calculation. Calculation: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Lost_Units. With L=2, this is 3 * 36.75 + 280 = 110.25 + 280 = 390.25.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554792001 is currently in a cooling demand phase following a very high-demand period. Demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has averaged 31.8 units/period. The pipeline remains contaminated with 280 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10 totaling 178, plus P24 totaling 102). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, it incorrectly believes 280 units are arriving that will never appear. To correct this, I must set mu_hat to include an offset. Calculation: Current actual mean demand is ~32. For a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage), required stock is 3 * 32 = 96. Adding the 280-unit lost pipeline offset results in a mu_hat of 376. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to maintain this correction and 'recent_N' for sigma with N=5 to capture current lower volatility. Lead time calculation is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual drift (average 1-3 periods).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45. On-hand inventory is 60. The reported In-transit is 440 units, but 280 units are confirmed lost (P1:70, P3:15, P4:17, P10:76, P24:102), making the effective pipeline 160 units (440 - 280). No orders have been placed since Period 40 or arrived since Period 43. Demand has cooled significantly in the last few periods (P41-P44: 28, 39, 12, 10), averaging 22.25 units/period. The current date is Dec 16; we might expect a final pre-holiday bump, but recent trends suggest a sharp decline. To prevent over-ordering due to the OR backend's inflated pipeline perception (it thinks there are 440 units in transit), I must set mu_hat such that the base stock calculation accounts for the 280 missing units. However, given the high on-hand (60) and recent low demand (avg 22), and knowing there are actually 160 units coming (P38: 147, P40: 20 was expected but 20 arrived P43, let's re-verify: P38 order 147 is still in transit, P39 order 55 arrived, P40 order 20 arrived), the only significant real order in the pipeline is Period 38 (147 units). Effective pipeline is indeed ~147. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the cooling trend while adding the 280-unit offset to bridge the pipeline gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Significant demand cooling confirmed (P41-P44 average: 22.25). Pipeline contamination remains at 280 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late December period (P46, 2019/12/23). Recent demand has significantly cooled, with a 5-period average (P41-P45) of 21.6 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime. Pipeline contamination remains a major factor: 280 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P24) are confirmed lost, meaning the reported 'In-transit' of 440 units only contains 160 units of viable inventory (440 - 280). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to include a 280-unit compensation offset. The demand forecast component of mu_hat is based on the recent cooling trend (approx 22 units/period), resulting in mu_hat = (1 + L) * 22 + 280. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 22) + 280 = 346. Since the game is near its end (P46 of 47), the goal is to maintain service levels without overstocking, but the large loss correction is necessary to trigger any required ordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554792001 is currently in a low-demand regime. Average demand from Period 43 to 46 is approximately 13.75 units per period, a significant drop from the high-demand peaks earlier in the year. The pipeline remains heavily contaminated with 280 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24), as none of these have arrived despite many periods elapsed. Reported In-transit is 440, but effective In-transit is 440 - 280 = 160. With on-hand inventory at 27 and effective in-transit at 160, the system is well-covered for the current low-demand regime. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 'phantom' 280 units it believes are in transit, I am setting mu_hat to include the 280-unit pipeline offset plus a forecast for the current regime (~14 units/period * 3 periods = 42). Total mu_hat = 322. Lead time method is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variance (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination constant at 280 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P24). Low-demand regime sustained (P43-P46 average: 13.8 units/period).
