Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Band leggings', a women's everyday basic item. Historical demand from the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a stable mean of approximately 99.6 units per week (100, 92, 103, 104, 99) with a low standard deviation (~4.8 units). There are no seasonal spikes expected in mid-February for basic jersey leggings. Promised lead time (L) is 2. My goal is to set parameters that cover demand for L+1 (3) periods. \u03bc\u0302 should be approximately 3 * 99.6 \u2248 298.8. \u03c3\u0302 should be approximately sqrt(3) * 4.8 \u2248 8.3. I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 2) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand statistics to capture the most relevant recent stable period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey leggings'. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a stable mean (\u03bc \u2248 99.6, \u03c3 \u2248 4.7). In Period 1, we ordered 108 units which are 'In-transit'. Current on-hand is 0, and we missed Period 1 demand of 92 units because the order hasn't arrived yet. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 3 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible at the start of Period 4. For Period 2's decision, we must project demand for the review + lead time window (1 + 2 = 3 periods). Using the historical average of ~100 per period, \u03bc\u0302 should be approximately 300. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stable recent demand window (92 to 104) while excluding potential outliers if they appear later. The 'explicit' lead time is kept at the promised 2 for now, as no 'conclude' message has contradicted it yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/02/25. The product is Women's Jersey leggings, a basic staple. Historical demand was stable around 100 units/week (avg 99.6), but Period 2 saw a spike to 138 units (+38%). Lead time is promised at 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (108 units) and Period 2 (108 units) are in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in P1 and P2. I will maintain the base stock logic to cover the (L+1) horizon. I'll use the recent demand trend (N=5 including provided history and P1/P2) which averages ~107 units/week to set mu_hat, while keeping L at the default promised 2 periods until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is 'Band leggings', a women's basic item. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (108 units), Period 2 (108 units), and Period 3 (132 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase and been reported in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Demand has been higher than the initial samples (92, 138, 124 vs sample mean ~100). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed the first expected arrival, I will explicitly set L=3 to account for the observed delay and use the recent 3 periods of demand (avg ~118) to calculate mu_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a higher base stock to recover from the stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is Women's Everyday Basics leggings, which shows consistent demand. Historical demand samples (Period -5 to -1) averaged ~100. However, observed demand in Periods 1-4 is higher: 92, 138, 124, 128 (average ~120.5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 4 arrival of 108 units (from P2) was immediately consumed by the demand of 128. The P1 order of 108 units is likely lost as it hasn't arrived by P4 (promised L=2). Since L=2, the P3 order (132 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P5 and be visible in the P5 conclude message. To recover from the stockout and account for the higher average demand and the potential loss of the P1 shipment, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time. This will allow the OR backend to adjust to the higher mean demand observed in the recent 4 periods (~120 vs ~100) and acknowledge the current lead time performance.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'Band leggings', a women's basics item. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 397 units in-transit. The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), confirming the promised lead time. The order from Period 1 (108 units) appears to be lost as it should have arrived in Period 3. Orders from Period 3 (132 units) and Period 4 (157 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 and 6 respectively; however, Period 5 conclude shows 0 arrivals. This suggests the Period 3 order is delayed or lost. Demand samples show a mean of ~105.7 (100, 92, 103, 104, 99 from pre-game; 92, 138, 124, 128, 71 from game). The recent drop to 71 might be a fluctuation or late winter/early spring transition. Given the stockout situation (on-hand = 0), I will set L to the promised 2 periods (as confirmed by the P2 order) and use recent_N for demand to catch the current trend. N=5 for mu_hat includes the recent low demand but maintains enough history to buffer against the stockout.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Band leggings', a women's basic item. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory has been 0 for most periods, leading to lost sales. Promised lead time is 2. Arrival in Period 4 (ordered Period 2) confirms an actual lead time of 2 periods. However, the order from Period 1 (108 units) never arrived and is now 4 periods overdue (it should have arrived in Period 3), signaling it is likely lost. The pipeline (In-transit: 397) includes orders from Period 3 (132) and Period 4 (157), plus the likely-lost Period 1 order. Demand has fluctuated: 92, 138, 124, 128, 71, 108 (Avg: 110). Recent demand has stabilized around the 100-110 mark after a dip in Period 5. Given the stockouts and the lost shipment, the OR backend needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (capturing all game history) and 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend use the confirmed L=2 observation.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (108 units) is likely lost (exceeded promised lead time by 4 periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The SKU is 'Band leggings', a women's basic jersey item. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has a mean of 112 units/period (92, 138, 124, 128, 71, 108, 138 in-game; 100, 92, 103, 104, 99 pre-game). Recent demand shows high volatility but maintains a baseline around 110. Inventory update: On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 397 units (Order P1=108, P3=132, P4=157). Lead Time analysis: Promised L=2. The Period 1 order (108 units) is extremely overdue (7 periods since order) and is now confirmed as lost. Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). Period 3 (ordered P3, expected P5) and Period 4 (ordered P4, expected P6) are both overdue, suggesting a structural lead-time shift or shipping delays. However, without a 'concluded' arrival for these, we cannot definitively calculate a new L. To account for the lost P1 units and ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the current stockout, I will set L to 2 (default) but use recent_N for demand to capture recent higher volatility. Because P1 is lost, the actual pipeline is 397 - 108 = 289 units. The OR engine subtracts 'pipeline' from its target. Since I cannot manually subtract from the backend's 'In-transit' count, I will use an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand plus an offset to compensate for the lost 108 units, essentially 'tricking' the engine into replacing the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time instability confirmed: P3 and P4 orders are overdue (6 and 5 periods elapsed respectively, promised L=2). Stockout persists since Period 4 due to these delays.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is 'Band leggings', a basic garment. The situation is critical: we have been in a persistent stockout since Period 4 due to severe lead-time instability and a likely lost shipment from Period 1. The Promised Lead Time is 2, but actual observations show: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), while Period 3 (ordered P3, now P9) is 6 periods overdue, and Period 4 (ordered P4, now P9) is 5 periods overdue. The Period 1 order is confirmed lost. Demand has been volatile but shows a mean of ~115 units over the last 8 periods. With 481 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P8), the OR backend's inventory position is high, which will prevent new ordering unless we adjust parameters. I will increase L to 4 to reflect the current supply chain delay and use an explicit mu_hat based on the historical mean of ~115 (115 * (1+4) = 575) to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger an order or at least account for the expected demand window given the delays.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). The item is a basic women's legging. Demand is relatively stable, with an average of approximately 117 units over the last 9 periods. However, we are facing a critical supply chain failure. On-hand inventory has been 0 since Period 5. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The Period 1 order (108 units) is almost certainly lost (9 periods elapsed). The Period 3 order (132 units) and Period 4 order (157 units) are severely overdue (7 and 6 periods elapsed, respectively). Total in-transit is 622 units against a mean demand of ~117. If we assume the lost/delayed stock will eventually arrive or be replaced, we must adjust L to reflect reality. Since multiple orders are missing past the 6-period mark, setting L to 6 allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for this extended risk. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the slight uptick in the last 4 periods (avg ~125), and default for sigma as the variance hasn't shifted significantly.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain crisis: Periodic orders from P3 and P4 (total 289 units) are now 6-7 periods overdue. Actual lead time is at least 7+ for these shipments, contrasting with the promised L=2.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019-04-22). The inventory situation has significantly changed: we finally received shipments in Period 10 (from orders placed in P8 and P9), ending the prolonged stockout. However, shipments from P1, P3, and P4 remain missing and are likely lost rather than merely delayed, as we have now received later orders (P8 and P9) successfully with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively. Total in-transit is 557, but the lost units (P1: 108, P3: 132, P4: 157 = 397 units) are inflating this number. The OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock; if we don't account for these lost units, it will stop ordering. Demand has remained relatively stable around a mean of ~114 units. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory and ensure the backend continues to order despite the perceived high pipeline, I will set L=2 (restored lead time) and use explicit values. I will set mu_hat based on the average demand of the last 5 periods (~129 units) multiplied by (1+L) = 387. I will set sigma_hat based on the standard deviation of historical samples, providing a buffer for the lead-time uncertainty observed in previous weeks.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 3 (132 units) and Period 4 (157 units) are confirmed lost as later orders (P8, P9) have already arrived. Total lost inventory: 397 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/04/29), we have 7 units on-hand and 557 units in-transit. Historically, shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 397 units) are confirmed lost because orders from P8 and P9 arrived successfully in P10. The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes these lost units, which will prevent it from ordering necessary stock unless the parameters are adjusted. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 113 units per week since Period 1. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will explicitly set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS a buffer to offset the lost 397 units. With L=2, (L+1)=3 periods of demand is ~340 units. Adding 397 units suggests a target base stock of ~737. Given the current 157 in-transit (P10 order) + 7 on-hand = 164, setting mu_hat high ensures the policy triggers an order to replenish the lost stock. I am using L=default (2) as recent shipments (P8, P9) returned to the promised lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand for 'Band leggings' is currently stable, averaging approximately 117 units over the last 5 periods (P8-P12: 138, 119, 111, 107, 111). We just experienced a stockout in P12 due to insufficient on-hand inventory. Regarding lead times, while there was significant disruption with lost orders from P1, P3, and P4, recent orders from P8 and P9 arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively. We current have an order of 160 from P10 and 208 from P12 in transit. To recover from the stockout and maintain service levels for a product with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand average (N=5) and assume a standard lead time of 2. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the current volatility without being skewed by the very early samples or the supply chain crisis period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Band leggings' (Womens Everyday Basics). Current date is May 13, 2019. Historical demand is stable with an average of approximately 112 units per period. The supply chain has been highly volatile: shipments from periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 397 units) are confirmed lost. However, more recent shipments from periods 8 and 9 arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods, respectively. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) with 765 units in-transit (from P10 and P12). The P10 order (160 units) is now at its promised lead time (2 periods), and the P12 order (208 units) is pending. Given the history of lost orders and current stockout, I will set L to 1 to account for the most recent fast arrival (P9) but use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current stable 112 units/period mean. This configuration helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock to recover from the stockout while acknowledging recent lead-time improvement.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Band leggings' has remained remarkably stable, with a mean of approximately 108 units over the last 14 periods (current range: 71-138). After a series of lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, and 4) that caused significant stockouts, recent arrivals (P8, P9, and P12) show that the lead time has stabilized back to the promised 2 periods (actual: 2, 1, 2). On-hand inventory is 113. In-transit inventory includes the Period 10 order (160 units, placed 5 periods ago - likely lost or severely delayed) and the Period 12 order (which already arrived). However, the system shows 557 units in-transit. Subtracting the confirmed lost units (P1: 108, P3: 132, P4: 157 = 397) and accounting for the P10 order (160), the pipeline is essentially zero functional units. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries, and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10) to capture the stable post-fluctuation mean while the OR engine manages the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: In-transit count (557) remains inflated by lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and likely P10 (160 units, 5 periods overdue). Effective pipeline is near zero.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a staple 'Womens Everyday Basics' legging. Demand shows relative stability, averaging 108.3 units/period over the last 15 periods, with a slight Recent N(5) average of 98.6. The primary challenge is lead-time reliability and inventory accounting. The 'In-transit' count of 557 units is misleading because shipments from P1 (108), P3 (132), P4 (157), and now likely P10 (160) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (P10 is now 6 periods since ordering vs promised L=2, and P11/12/14/15 have already processed arrivals or skips). Total lost units = 108+132+157+160 = 557. This means the actual effective pipeline is 0. With On-hand at 31 and current weekly demand around 85-110, we are facing an immediate stockout in Period 16. To trigger an order despite the phantom 'In-transit' count, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' with a value of 1. By setting L=1, the OR engine calculates base stock for (1+1)=2 periods. Since \u03bc\u0302 is (1+L) * demand, I will set \u03bc\u0302 to 330 (approx 3 periods of demand) using 'explicit' to bypass the backend's pipeline subtraction of the 557 lost units as much as possible, forcing a fresh order to replenish the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Shipment from Period 10 (160 units) is now confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed, later orders arrived). Total lost inventory in pipeline is 557 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the system remains in a stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 557 is completely comprised of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 (108+132+157+160 = 557). These shipments are far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods, and subsequent orders (P8, P9, P12) have already arrived and been depleted. Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. To rectify the stockout and signal the OR backend to place a new order, I will use 'explicit' methods. I determine L=2 (promised and recently observed for P8 and P12). For demand, the average of the last 5 samples (P12-P16) is 91 units. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * 91 = 273. For sigma_hat, I use the standard deviation of the last 5 samples (~16.3) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in approximately 28. These parameters will bypass the false in-transit count and trigger a replenishment order.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/06/10), the system is in a stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 557 units is comprised entirely of lost shipments from periods 1, 3, 4, and 10, as later orders (Periods 8, 9, 12) have already arrived and concluded. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (in-transit) from the target base stock, it will not place a new order as long as it believes there are 557 units coming. To force the system to order, I must set mu_hat to a 'fictitious' high value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (557) plus the required cycle stock. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 70 units/period. For a target lead time of 2, we need approx (1+2)*70 = 210 units of coverage. To overcome the 557 phantom units, mu_hat needs to be at least 557 + 210 = 767. I will set mu_hat to 800 to ensure a robust order is placed to break the stockout. L remains at the promised 2, and sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Phantom pipeline confirmed at 557 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10). Any mu_hat setting must exceed 557 to trigger a physical order.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 19. Historical demand has softened slightly since early 2019, but the primary challenge is the pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' count is 824 units, but 557 of these units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 (as identified in carry-over insights). This 'phantom inventory' prevents the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the supply is sufficient. The effective real pipeline is 267 units (ordered in P18). Demand is approximately 100 units/period (average excluding recent stockout artifacts). To force a new order to cover upcoming demand, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (557) plus the desired real stock. Specifically, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma. With L=2, mu_hat covers 3 periods of demand. To ensure we keep ordering despite the 557-unit ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat to 800 (calculated as roughly 100 * 3 periods + 500 safety offset) to trigger the replenishment engine while accounting for the lost units. sigma_hat is set to recent volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (June 24th), we are moving into a seasonally lower demand phase for 'Band leggings', a jersey basic product. Recent demand has significantly dropped from ~100+ units/period to an average of 34 units over the last 3 periods (38, 30, and the previous trend). Specifically, Period 18 saw 38 and Period 19 saw 30. We currently have 237 units on-hand, which is significantly more than our expected demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 35 = 105 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 565 units consists almost entirely of 'phantom pipeline' (557 units from lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, and now likely P12 partially or P18 leftovers). Because the phantom pipeline (557) + on-hand (237) = 794 is much higher than any realistic base stock for current demand levels, the backend will not place an order. However, we must set mu_hat and sigma_hat cautiously. To prevent unnecessary ordering while acknowledging the demand drop, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (~35 units/period), allowing on-hand inventory to deplete naturally. L=2 remains the reliable lead-time estimate despite past volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has dropped from ~110 to ~35 units/period starting Period 18 (Date: 2019/6/10).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), the product (Band Leggings) has entered a low-demand regime. Average demand has dropped significantly from ~110 units/period to approximately 28 units/period over the last three reports (P18: 38, P19: 30, P20: 16). On-hand inventory is currently 221 units, which covers about 8 periods of current demand. The pipeline (In-transit: 565) remains heavily distorted by 557 units of 'phantom pipeline' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P10). Only 8 units (ordered in P19) are potentially real in-transit stock. Since the backend OR logic calculates 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', and the phantom pipeline (557) is much higher than any reasonable base_stock for a 28 units/period demand regime, the backend will not place any new orders. This is the desired outcome given the 221 units on-hand. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new demand regime (approx 28/period), and lead time L to default (2).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand regime. Starting Period 18 (June 10), demand dropped significantly from ~110 units/period to an average of ~28 units/period (38, 30, 16, 29). On-hand inventory is 192 units, which covers approximately 6-7 periods of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 565 is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1: 108, P3: 132, P4: 157, P10: 160; total 557 units). The true pipeline is likely only 8 units (ordered P19). Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline (including phantom units) from base_stock to determine orders, and current on-hand (192) already exceeds the short-term needs for this low-demand summer season, no new orders are desired. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the recent demand drop. We maintain a high enough sigma_hat (recent_N) to account for volatility in this lower volume. L is set to calculate for stability.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Womens Jersey Leggings) is currently in a low-demand regime that began around Period 18 (2019-06-10), likely due to a post-Spring seasonality drop. Demand over the last 5 periods has averaged 29 units/period (38, 30, 16, 29, 32), significantly lower than the ~110 units observed earlier in the year. The current 'on-hand' inventory is 160 units, and the 'in-transit' figure of 565 units consists almost entirely of 557 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10) plus a small residual 'real' order of 8 units from P19. Because the OR backend uses a pipeline-aware policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the 'phantom pipeline' of 557 units acts as a massive barrier to new orders. To ensure the backend doesn't stay paralyzed if stock runs out, mu_hat must be set to account for this phantom pipeline. However, with current on-hand inventory at 160 and demand at ~30, we have over 5 weeks of stock (safety included). I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_pipeline. For L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 30 + 557 = 647. This keeps the system ready to order once on-hand stocks deplete, while acknowledging the lost shipments.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) remains in a low-demand regime that began around Period 18 (June 10). Demand for the last 6 periods has averaged 28.7 units (38, 30, 16, 29, 32, 27), significantly lower than the previous ~110 units/period. The current date is 2019/07/22, mid-summer, which matches the sustained lower demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' item compared to spring. Regarding inventory, the reported In-transit of 565 units consists of 557 confirmed lost units (P1: 108, P3: 132, P4: 157, P10: 160) and 8 units from P19. The effective pipeline inventory is only 8 units. With On-hand at 133 and expected demand at ~29, we have enough stock for over 4 weeks. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive pipeline and potentially under-ordering later (or to clear the system's logic), mu_hat must technically account for (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the phantom pipeline (557 units). However, because On-hand (133) is currently high relative to demand (forecasted ~29/week * 3 = 87), no order is needed. I will set mu_hat using the recent 6 samples to reflect the current regime (~87 total for 3 periods), while acknowledging the phantom inventory will bypass the need for an order this period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The sku 608458001 is currently in a low-demand regime that began around Period 18 (2019/06/10), dropping from a mean of ~110 to ~30 units/period. The current date is 2019/07/29, which is mid-summer, a period where basic jersey leggings may see less demand compared to spring. Most critically, the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 565 units. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights), 557 of these units are 'phantom pipeline'\u2014lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 that were never delivered and never reconciled by the backend. The effective pipeline is only 8 units (ordered Period 19). With on-hand inventory at 121 and demand averaging ~30, we have roughly 4 periods of stock available. Given the promised lead time (L=2), we are currently overstocked. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 557 units as valid inventory (which would prevent any new orders when we eventually need them), mu_hat must be set to account for this phantom stock. However, since we currently have excess inventory (121 on-hand + 8 real in-transit = 129 vs a needed base stock of ~90-100), I will set mu_hat conservatively using the recent low-demand regime (N=7) and include the phantom offset (+557) once stock levels drop further. For this period, I will use a high N for sigma to smooth volatility and the default L.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) is experiencing a sustained low-demand regime since Period 18. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P18-P25) is approximately 25.25 units/period, down significantly from the initial ~110. Current on-hand inventory is 103 units, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' count of 565 is primarily composed of confirmed lost shipments (557 units from P1, P3, P4, and P10) and an 8-unit order from P19 which is likely lost or delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (565 units) from the target base stock, it would normally not place any new orders. To ensure we maintain a safety buffer without triggering excessive ordering while the pipeline is 'clogged' with phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to exceed the phantom pipeline plus the desired 3-period coverage (L+1=3). Setting mu_hat to 660 (approx 557 lost + 3 * 34 forecast) allows the system to remain 'ready' to order if physical stock were to drop precipitously, though current on-hand (103) is sufficient. L is set to calculated (2) and sigma is based on recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Women's Jersey Leggings) is currently in a low-demand regime that began around Period 18 (early June). The average demand over the last 9 periods (P18-P26) is approximately 25 units per period, a significant drop from the spring peak (~110 units). As of P27, we have 86 units on-hand, which covers roughly 3.4 periods of current demand. The pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by 557 units of 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments in P1, P3, P4, and P10. To place any new orders, the OR backend's calculated base_stock (mu_hat) must exceed this 'In-transit' figure of 571. Currently, with L=2, a mu_hat based on recent demand (~25 * 3 = 75) would not trigger an order. However, since on-hand is sufficient for the next 3 weeks, no new order is urgent. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual Lead Time (average ~1.6 based on valid arrivals) and use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-June demand drop, effectively maintaining our current inventory buffer without over-ordering against the phantom pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Womens Jersey Leggings) is currently in a low-demand regime that began around Period 18 (2019-06-10). The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P18-P27) is approximately 22.9 units per period, with a standard deviation of 8.95. This is significantly lower than the historical average of ~100. On-hand inventory is 76 units, which covers roughly 3.3 periods of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 571 units is heavily inflated by 557 units of 'phantom pipeline' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P10). The backend cap logic subtracts this pipeline from the base stock. To ensure the backend places any physical order if needed, or at least correctly values the current state, mu_hat must be set to compensate for this 557-unit ghost inventory. Currently, 76 (on-hand) + 14 (real in-transit from P19/P26) = 90 real units. Total perceived pipeline = 571 + 76 = 647. I will set mu_hat explicitly to match the phantom pipeline plus a conservative buffer (3 periods of demand) to prevent premature ordering while acknowledging the low demand regime. Observed lead times are stable at 1-2 periods for recently arrived orders.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is women's jersey leggings, a year-round basic but seeing a significant seasonal decline in late summer (August). Current demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~23 units/period) compared to the previous ~35 units/period observed around June. On-hand inventory is 47 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of current demand. The pipeline inventory is officially 571 units, but 557 units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10. The effective pipeline inventory is actually only 14 units (from P19 and P26). Because the OR engine interprets the full 571 units as valid pipeline, it will not place a new order unless the calculated base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) exceeds 618 (571 in-transit + 47 on-hand). To maintain a healthy stock level and avoid stockouts from the real pipeline being nearly empty, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom pipeline. I am targeting a true base stock of approximately 100 units (mean demand of 23 * 3 periods + buffer). Therefore, I set mu_hat to 660 (557 phantom + 103 desired stock) to force the engine to recognize the need for a small maintenance order and to offset the phantom inventory logic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened in August: Mean demand from Period 20-28 is ~23 units/period, down from ~35 units. Phantom pipeline persists at 557 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 29 units, and the recorded in-transit is 625 units. However, as established in the carry-over insights, 557 units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 (108+132+157+160 = 557). This results in an effective pipeline of only 68 units (625 - 557), which matches the most recent orders from Period 19 (8 units), Period 26 (6 units), and Period 29 (54 units). The demand regime has significantly softened in the last 10 periods (June-August), averaging ~22 units/period. To ensure the backend OR logic places an order despite the 557-unit 'phantom pipeline', I must set mu_hat such that the base stock (approx mu_hat) minus the phantom pipeline triggers a physical order. With promised L=2, the total coverage required is for 3 periods (L+1). At ~25 units/period, we need ~75 units. To offset the 557 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 75 + 557 = 632. I will use 'explicit' to provide this value. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current low volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 31 (2019-09-09). The product is a staple item (jersey leggings) which experienced a significant demand drop over the summer. Mean demand from Period 20 to 30 is approximately 22 units per period (Std Dev ~7.5). On-hand inventory is critically low (5 units). The 'In-transit' quantity is 625, but 557 units are confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10). The effective pipeline is only 68 units (P19=8, P26=6, P29=54). To trigger a physical order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to account for both the expected lead-time demand and the 'dead' pipeline of 557 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Effective mu_hat target = (3 periods * 22 units/period) + 557 phantom units = 623. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the standard calculation and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Band leggings) is experiencing a period of low, settled demand around 20 units/period (avg of last 5 periods: 20 units). However, the critical operational challenge is a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 557 units from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (currently 629) but will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from its calculated base stock; therefore, to trigger any physical order, mu_hat must be set to exceed this phantom count plus desired safety stock. Currently, on-hand is 0 and we are stocking out as of Period 31. Recent orders from Period 26 (6 units) and Period 29 (54 units) have not yet arrived (expected L=2). Since we are in mid-September, demand for leggings (Womens Everyday Basics) is expected to be stable or slightly increasing as fall begins. To clear the phantom pipeline and ensure a physical order is placed to meet the current demand of ~20 units/period, mu_hat is set explicitly to 700. This covers the 557 lost units + ~4 periods of demand (~80) + safety stock. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect actual recent arrival behavior (generally 1-2 periods for successful deliveries).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) is experiencing a severe phantom pipeline issue. Historical data specifies that 557 units from periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 are lost and will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 707 units. Subtracting the 557 lost units leaves a real pipeline of 150 units (comprising orders from P26: 6, P29: 54, P31: 4 (arrived), P32: 82, totaling 142 valid in-transit units remaining). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the mean demand since Period 20 is approximately 21.3 units/period (21.3 * 3 = 64 for L+1). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (707) from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that covers both the desired safety stock and the 557 phantom units to trigger any physical order. Given the recent demand drop and a stockout in Period 32, I need to force an order. I set mu_hat to 660 (557 phantom units + ~100 units for 3-weeks of demand/safety) to ensure the system recognizes a need for inventory despite the fake 557 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Real in-transit pipeline as of Period 32 is 142 units (P26, P29, P32). Pipeline of 557 units remains permanently lost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. The 'Band leggings' SKU has transitioned into a very low demand regime since June (Period 18), further softening to ~20 units/period in August/September. The system reports In-transit inventory as 707 units, but 557 of these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 (as tracked in carry-over insights). The real pipeline consists of the orders from Period 26 (6 units - likely lost or severely delayed), Period 29 (54 units), and Period 32 (82 units), totaling 142 units. However, the OR backend's 'base stock' calculation will subtract the full 707 'in-transit' units from its target. To force the OR engine to place an order when on-hand is zero, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (557) plus the required safety stock. Current average demand is ~18 units/period. For a lead time of 2, (1+L) * demand = 3 * 18 = 54 units. To overcome the 557 phantom units and target a real base stock of ~70 units, I must set mu_hat to approximately 627. I will use a high sigma_hat to ensure the backend service level logic maintains a buffer despite the low demand, accounting for the recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Real in-transit pipeline as of P33 is 142 units (from P26, P29, P32). Pipeline of 557 units remains permanently lost but persists in system totals.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) is experiencing a significant demand decline and a supply chain 'phantom pipeline' issue. Demand from Period 20 to 34 has averaged approximately 21.3 units per period, a sharp drop from the ~110 units seen earlier in the year. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 707 units, but analysis of Carry-over Insights reveals that 557 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10) are permanently lost. Additionally, orders from P26 (6 units), P29 (54 units), and P32 (82 units) are currently in-transit but potentially late or lost, as P31 has already arrived. The effective 'real' pipeline is 142 units or less. To trigger a physical order, the OR backend's target base stock (calculated as mu_hat) must exceed the perceived pipeline (707 units). However, given the current low demand (~21/period) and 0 on-hand inventory, ordering hundreds of units just to bypass the phantom pipeline would result in excessive holding costs once they arrive. I will set mu_hat to 750 using the 'explicit' method to account for the 557 phantom units plus approximately 6-8 weeks of actual demand (193 units) to ensure a small buffer is maintained despite the stockout, while attempting to force the system to reconcile the inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Real in-transit pipeline (P26, P29, P32 totaling 142 units) is overdue or lost as P31 (ordered later) arrived in P32. Combined with the 557 units previously lost, the total phantom pipeline is likely 699 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Jersey leggings) is in a low-demand regime. Mean demand since Period 29 (late August) is approximately 16 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 75 units, which covers about 4-5 periods of demand. The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 679 units, but this is almost entirely composed of 'phantom' pipeline from lost shipments. Based on history, 557 units were lost early on (P1, P3, P4, P10), and more recently, orders from P26 (6 units) and P29 (54 units) are likely lost as well because the P31 and P32 orders have already arrived or were resolved. Total estimated phantom pipeline is 557 + 6 + 54 = 617 units. To place a new order, the OR backend's target base stock (calculated from mu_hat) must exceed the perceived pipeline (679). However, with 75 units on hand and demand low, we do not need to order more units yet. I will set mu_hat using the recent 7-period mean (~16 units/period * (1+L=3) = 48) which is below the current inventory level, effectively preventing premature ordering while the phantom pipeline persists.

Carry-over insight: Current phantom pipeline is estimated at 617 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). Actual mean demand since Period 29 has stabilized at ~16 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 (Jersey leggings) has entered a low-demand regime since Period 29, averaging approximately 15.5 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 114 units, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 625 units. However, history confirms that most of this pipeline is comprised of 'phantom' lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 26, and 29), totaling 625 units. Specifically, P26 (6 units) and P29 (54 units) are now 11 and 8 periods overdue, while a later order (P35) arrived in just 1 period. This justifies treating the entire 625-unit pipeline as lost. With on-hand inventory at 114 and current demand at ~16 units/period, we have over 7 periods of supply. Because the OR backend formula `order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)` factors in the full (phantom) pipeline, and our base stock needs are low (~50-60 units), no new physical orders will be triggered by even high mu_hat settings. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand reality and wait for on-hand inventory to deplete naturally while the phantom pipeline persists.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline adjusted to 625 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). Actual mean demand stabilized at ~16 units/period since Period 29.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 608458001 is currently in a low-demand regime (~16 units/period) since late August (Period 29). The system shows an inflated in-transit balance of 625 units due to historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). These 625 units are 'phantom' and will never arrive, but they prevent the OR engine from ordering unless the target base stock (calculated from mu_hat) exceeds this phantom pipeline + on-hand inventory. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 104 units, providing ~6 periods of cover at current demand levels. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom pipeline (625) plus approximately 3 periods of demand (3 * 16 = 48) to ensure the system is capable of placing an order if on-hand inventory drops too low, though no new order is expected this period. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability between 1 and 3 periods observed recently.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'Band leggings' has stabilized in a low-demand regime. Analysis of the demand from Period 29 through Period 38 shows a mean of approximately 14.2 units/period. The current date is 2019-11-04, heading into the winter season for this 'everyday basic' jersey item; recent demand is slightly lower but consistent. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 625 units, which is confirmed to be a 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 26, 29). This phantom pipeline significantly exceeds the required base stock for the current demand regime. To trigger any real replenishments, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' to account for these ghost units. I will set mu_hat to cover the phantom pipeline (625) plus approximately 3 periods of current demand (3 * 15 = 45) to ensure the backend sees a need for stock if on-hand inventory (98) drops further. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the volatile lead times observed (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current low-volatility state.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 94 units, with a phantom pipeline of approximately 625 units (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). Demand has significantly slowed since mid-August (Period 29), averaging approximately 11.5 units per period over the last 10 weeks (Periods 30-39). Current on-hand inventory (94) is sufficient to cover nearly 8 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the phantom pipeline, any standard base-stock calculation will result in an order of zero unless mu_hat is set extremely high. Since we already have excess stock relative to the current low demand regime, I will set parameters to reflect the recent demand stability (~12 units/period) and wait for inventory to deplete.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~12 units/period since Period 30 (Date: 2019/9/2). Phantom pipeline remains at 625 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 608458001 (Jersey leggings) has entered a very low regime, with the last five periods (P36-P40) showing demand of 15, 10, 6, 4, and 3 respectively, averaging roughly 7.6 units. The current date is mid-November, and demand appears to be trailing off significantly compared to the earlier autumn levels of ~12-16 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 91 units, which is ample to cover several weeks of current demand. However, there is a persistent 'phantom pipeline' of 625 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). Since the OR backend uses the formula (base_stock - pipeline), and 91 (on-hand) + 625 (phantom) = 716 is vastly higher than any realistic base stock for a 12-unit/period demand, the system will not place new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset this ghost inventory. To maintain control while ensuring no unnecessary orders are placed, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the recent demand regime (approx 8 units/period x 3 periods of lead+review = 24), but also keep L at the promised value. Since actual demand is so low and we have 91 units on hand, the primary goal is to avoid high holding costs while the ghost pipeline prevents the system from over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further shifted downward in November (P36-P40): mean demand dropped to ~7.6 units/period from the previous ~12. Phantom pipeline remains static at 625 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), the SKU 'Band leggings' continues its low-demand trend observed throughout November. Since Period 36, demand has been very low: 15, 10, 6, 4, 3, 4, averaging 7 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 87 units, which provides approximately 12 periods of coverage at the current sales rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 625 units is confirmed as 'phantom pipeline'\u2014a historical accumulation of lost shipments from early-to-mid 2019 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). These 625 units will likely never arrive but are subtracted from the base_stock calculation by the OR backend. To ensure the system doesn't generate unnecessary orders while also accounting for this phantom deficit, mu_hat must be set carefully. However, since on-hand (87) is currently far above the required stock level for L=2 (approx 3 * 7 = 21 units), the priority is avoiding holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent demand drop to ~7.6, and let on-hand inventory naturally deplete.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608458001' (Band leggings) experienced a significant demand spike in Period 42 (69 units), coinciding with the start of the holiday shopping season (late November). This breaks the previous low-demand regime of ~7.6 units/period observed since Period 36. Given the date (Dec 2), I anticipate sustained higher demand for the next few periods due to December seasonality. Current on-hand inventory is 18 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 625 units is confirmed as 'phantom pipeline' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). Since the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, and the cap is also low, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (625) plus the desired target stock to trigger a physical order. I will forecast a 'real' demand of ~50 units/period for the holiday season. Total Target = (1+L)*demand + phantom = (1+2)*50 + 625 = 775. Setting mu_hat to 775 will signal the OR engine to place an order, as 775 - 625 (pipeline) - 18 (on-hand) = 132 units, which will be moderated by the engine's internal cap.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed in Period 42 (69 units). Transitioned from low-demand regime (~8 units) to seasonal peak (~50+ units). Phantom pipeline remains confirmed at 625 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a holiday demand peak for 'Band leggings', a jersey basic product. Demand jumped from a low regime of ~8 units to 69 units in P42 and 76 units in P43. Given the date (Dec 9) and the nature of the product, we expect this high demand to persist or slightly increase through the end of the year. The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 795 units, but our Carry-over Insights track a substantial 'phantom pipeline' of 625 units from lost historical shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 170 units (the order placed in P43). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a promised lead time of 2 (meaning new orders arrive in P46), we must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 625-unit phantom offset and trigger a physical order. We forecast demand at ~80-90 units/period for the next 3 weeks (L+1). To bypass the backend pipe calculation: target_base_stock = (effective_pipeline + new_order_needed). We want to order approximately 150-200 units. Thus, mu_hat needs to be roughly 625 (phantom) + 170 (real) + 200 (extra) = 995. This is roughly (1+L) * 330.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike sustained: Period 42 (69 units), Period 43 (76 units). Projected demand for remainder of year is 75-90 units/period. Phantom pipeline remains at 625 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak. Demand in Period 42 was 69 and Period 43 was 76, though Period 44 showed a low 7 units which is likely a reporting artifact or temporary dip before the final Christmas surge. The 'In-transit' count of 1093 includes 625 units of confirmed phantom pipeline (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). Subtracting this gives a real physical pipeline of 468 units (orders from P43 and P44). The lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance, which has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be set explicitly to exceed the phantom pipeline plus the desired stock for the holiday period. With target demand around 80-90 units/period and a (L+1) horizon of 3 periods, we need ~270 units of real inventory. Adding the 625 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 895 to ensure the system maintains stock for the final weeks of the year.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: Recorded high demand (avg 72) in late Nov/early Dec followed by a sharp dip in P44. Expected final surge before year-end. Phantom pipeline remains stagnant at 625 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are at the tail end of the holiday season for high-turnover women's basics. Demand surged in Period 42-43 (~72 avg) and then fluctuated (7 in P44, 36 in P45). With Christmas and Boxing Day sales occurring this week, a final demand peak is expected before demand reverts to post-holiday lows in January. On-hand inventory is 134 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 923 units is heavily distorted by the 625-unit phantom pipeline (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). Excluding these, the real pipeline consists of P44 (298 units). Total effective inventory (On-hand 134 + Real Pipeline 298) is 432 units. Given the transition from high-utility peak (75-90 units/period) to a lower January regime, 432 units are sufficient to cover the next 3-4 periods of demand. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 625 phantom units as available stock and suppressing necessary future orders, mu_hat must be set to account for this 'invisible' inventory deficit while L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (recently ~2 periods). No additional order is required this period given existing stocks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), ending the holiday peak. Demand in the last five periods has been 69, 76, 7, 36, and 18. While the average is ~41, there is a clear downward trend following the mid-December peak. The next periods (January) historically showed stable demand around 100 units/period (based on initial samples), but seeing as current regimes are lower, I expect a post-holiday stabilization. The system shows In-transit: 923. However, based on Carry-over Insights, 625 units are 'phantom' (lost from P1, P3, P4, P10, P26, P29). A further 298 units were ordered in P44 and are expected to arrive in P47 (observatory confirmation in P48). Total real pipeline is approximately 298 units. On-hand is 116. The total effective inventory (Real Pipeline + On-hand) is 414. Using mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=5 for the holiday period would yield a base stock target of roughly (1+L)*41 = 123, which is below our phantom pipeline of 625. To ensure the backend places an order if needed despite the 625 phantom units, mu_hat must technically exceed 625 + (Target Safety Stock). However, looking at the current inventory of 414 real units against a demand of ~20-40, we are overstocked for the immediate future. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the holiday mean, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the recent high volatility. L remains 'default' (2).

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline: P44-P46 mean demand dropped to 20.3 units compared to 72.5 in P42-P43. Real pipeline confirmed at 298 units (P44 order), total phantom pipeline remains 625 units.
