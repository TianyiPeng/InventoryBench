Historical Analysis: 5 weeks of data (Jan 7 - Feb 4) show a very stable mean (~99.6 units) with low variance (range 92-104). Calendar Context: Current date is Feb 11. No major demand spikes expected for basics in mid-February, though spring transition often maintains steady sales for leggings. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the order for Period 1, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods) because the order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4. Inventory: On-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. Targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (~100 units/period) plus a small safety buffer for the initial fill.",

  "rationale": "(a) Product: Band leggings (Jersey basic). Date: Nov 11. Historically, demand for this basic item peaked in Spring (~100-130) and troughed in Summer (~15-30). We are currently in a deep Autumn/Pre-Winter trough with demand averaging ~11 units/week over the last 6 periods and the most recent demand hitting a low of 4 units. (b) Demand Analysis: The regime is extremely low compared to the Spring peak. Average demand (P34-P39) is ~11.5 units. There is no evidence of a Year-End holiday spike for this specific SKU yet. (c) Lead Time & Lost Orders: Total confirmed lost units reach 1035 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P24, P29). Subtracting these from the 1055 'In-transit' leaves only 20 units actually in the pipeline (likely the order from P26 which is extremely overdue, or more likely, the pipeline is effectively empty and those remaining 20 units are also lost/ghosts). (d) Inventory: On-hand is 149 units. (e) Final Logic: At a demand rate of ~11 units/week, 149 units covers approximately 13 weeks of demand. With only 8 periods remaining in the game (up to Period 47), the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would only increase holding costs without increasing sales.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Current demand regime (Autumn/Late-year) stabilized at ~11 units/week, significantly lower than Spring levels. Total confirmed/likely lost units now include Period 29 (50 units), bringing the cumulative loss to 1035 units. Current on-hand inventory (149) exceeds remaining game-life demand requirements.",

With 146 units currently on hand and only 7 periods remaining in the simulation, total expected demand through Period 47 is approximately 40-70 units. My current stock levels are more than double the maximum foreseeable demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1.0/unit) without increasing sales.

Based on current demand levels, the total expected demand for the remainder of the game is significantly less than the 142 units currently on-hand (estimated ~25-40 units total). The holding cost is $1.0 per unit/period, while the profit is $4.0 per unit. Maintaining excess inventory is extremely costly at this stage. The in-transit figure (1055) is primarily composed of historical lost orders (1035 units) which should be ignored. With 142 units on-hand and minimal demand projected, no further orders are required to maintain a 100% service level through the end of the simulation.

Historical data from early 2019 showed demand ~100 units/week. While demand might stay elevated through the holiday season (December), we have 73 units on hand and 5 periods remaining. Total expected demand for the rest of the game (Periods 43-47) at a conservative rate of 15-20 units/week is ~75-100 units. Given the $1.00 holding cost and only 5 periods left, the risk of overstocking significantly outweighs the benefit of extra units, especially since any order placed now (Period 43) with a lead time of 2-3 periods would only arrive for Period 45 or 46.

Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a significant retail spike in late November/early December (Period 42: 69 units, Period 43: 76 units), which typically corresponds to the holiday shopping season (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Given the 2-period promised lead time (actual lead time has recently fluctuated between 1-3 periods), any order placed now (Period 44) will arrive at the earliest in Period 45 or 46. If it arrives in Period 46, it can satisfy demand for Periods 46 and 47. Based on the recent spike, I estimate the remaining holiday demand will be approximately 50-70 units per week. I need to cover the remaining 4 periods. Since I have 0 on-hand and total in-transit units (1055) are effectively all confirmed losses from early game periods (1035 units confirmed lost per carry-over insights), I have no viable pipeline.

After a very quiet autumn (~5 units/week), demand spiked to ~70-75 units/week in late November/early December (Periods 42-43) before dropping significantly to 7 units in Period 44. Historically, 'Band leggings' (everyday basics) may see a secondary peak right before Christmas followed by a clearance or stabilization. On-hand inventory is currently 0. An order of 210 units was placed in Period 44. Given lead times typically range from 1 to 3 periods, this order is likely to arrive in Period 45, 46, or 47. Since there are only 3 periods remaining (45, 46, 47), and a large pipeline of 210 units (plus historical undelivered units which are likely lost but remain in the IT figure) is already active, placing additional orders is risky. If the P44 order arrives in Period 45 or 46, it will sufficiently cover the remaining demand (forecasted at roughly 30-50 units/week for the holiday tail). Adding more inventory now increases the risk of high holding costs at the game's end with no further periods to sell through. I will maintain the current pipeline and not place a new order.",
