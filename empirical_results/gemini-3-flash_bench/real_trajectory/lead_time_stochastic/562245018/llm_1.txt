This is a staple 'Everyday Collection' item, typically exhibiting steady baseline demand with moderate seasonal peaks in spring and autumn. Calendar Context: Currently Period 1 (Feb 11, 2019). We are approaching Spring seasonal transitions. Demand Regime: Historical data shows a clear upward trend: 101, 101, 117, 123, 157. The most recent period (Feb 4) saw a jump to 157, suggesting the start of a spring demand lift. Lead Time Logic: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the order, I need to cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. Demand Forecast: Estimating a conservative average of ~140-150 units per period for the next 3 periods, given the recent upward trend. Total needed for 3 periods \u2248 450 units. Order Logic: Order = (Forecasted Demand during coverage window) - (On-hand) - (In-transit) = 450 - 0 - 0 = 450.",

Total expected demand for P2+P3+P4 is ~450-480 units. I already have 450 units in transit (expected at start of P4). However, as I am currently stocked out and the first arrival won't hit until P3 or P4, I must order more to ensure I don't continue to stock out once the initial shipment is depleted or if demand continues to rise.

Seasonally, early March is a transition period into Spring shopping, so demand is expected to remain firm or slightly increase. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (450 units) should arrive in P3's resolution, becoming visible at the start of P4. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. Looking at the timing rule: P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3 and be visible in 'P3 conclude'. Since 'P3 conclude' says arrived=0, the shipment is likely delayed or lost. I have 0 on-hand inventory and 710 in-transit. Based on demand of ~170/week and L=2, the pipeline requirement for L+1 (3 weeks) is ~510 units. While 710 is in-transit, the apparent delay of the P1 order (450 units) creates a risk.

The remaining 200 units in-transit are from P10; if they haven't arrived by now (P13), they are likely lost as well given the typical 1-2 period lead time. Thus, I treat 'reliable' in-transit as 0. My current on-hand of 643 units covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand (643 / 152). With a lead time of 2, I have sufficient stock to cover the lead time and a safety buffer.

The supply chain remains highly unreliable: of the 2,020 units currently in transit, 1,670 units are classified as 'phantom stock' (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P26, P29, and now likely P34 which is 4 periods old). The 'reliable' pipeline consists of P36 (200 units, 2 periods old) and P38 (150 units). On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in P38. Total reliable inventory (0 on-hand + 350 reliable in-transit) must cover the lead time + 1 period (approximately 3-4 periods of demand). Given a demand estimate of ~150-180 units/week and the high risk of further order losses, a safety-oriented order of 300 units is placed to ensure availability for the upcoming November weeks and to compensate for the likely loss of the P34 shipment.",

Demand in Period 39 was 109, but the average since the October peak (P33) has been around 140 units/week. On-hand inventory is 91. The total in-transit count of 2120 contains 1670 units of 'phantom' stock confirmed lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P26, P29, P34). Therefore, the 'real' in-transit pipeline consists of P38 (150) and P39 (300) for a total of 450 units. Lead times are currently fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.5 lately). To cover a lead time of 2-3 periods at an expected demand of ~140/week (requiring ~420-560 units total), we calculation: [On-hand (91) + Real In-transit (450)] = 541 units.

Recent demand (P38-P40) has been 187, 109, and 132 units. I estimate a base demand of ~135 units/week for the next 3 weeks. Regarding the pipeline: the 'In-transit' count of 2270 is heavily inflated by 1670 units of 'phantom' stock confirmed lost (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P26, P29, and now P34). The reliable in-transit pipeline consists of: P38 (150), P39 (300), and P40 (150), totaling 600 units. Since on-hand is currently 0, I expect the P38 order (150) to arrive in P41 and the P39 order (300) in P42. To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current decision period (total 3 periods of demand at ~135/week = 405 units) while maintaining a small safety buffer against supplier inconsistency, I need to ensure the reliable pipeline + on-hand covers our needs. Current reliable total is 600 units, which covers the immediate 3-week window.
