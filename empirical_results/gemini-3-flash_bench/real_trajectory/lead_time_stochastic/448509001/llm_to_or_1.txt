Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a type of high-waist jeans. Historical demand samples (last 5 periods) are 65, 117, 162, 118, 146. The mean demand is approximately 121.6 units per week. Although we are in February, there isn't yet enough confirmation of a specific seasonal trend change beyond the initial samples provided. Given the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the promised lead time of 2 periods plus the review period (total 3 periods of demand). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a buffer for volatility while we await confirmation of actual lead times.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The SKU is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a basic trousers item from the Divided Collection. Total demand history (last 6 weeks) shows values of 65, 117, 162, 118, 146, and most recently 149 in Period 1. The demand seems to have stabilized around a mean of ~140-150 units per week over the last four observations. In Period 1, we ordered 183 units with a promised lead time of 2. This order is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, leading to a stockout in Period 1 (demand 149, sold 0). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current stable demand level (avg ~144 per period). With L=2, the backend will target (1+2=3) periods of demand. Sigma will reflect recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during the recovery phase.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand data (Jan 7 to Feb 4) showed a rising trend (65, 117, 162, 118, 146). Periods 1 and 2 demand were 149 and 150 respectively, indicating a stable regime around ~150 units/week. On-hand remains 0 because the first order (placed P1, promised lead time 2) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the P3 conclude message. Total in-transit is 358 (183 from P1, 175 from P2). Given the stable demand of ~150, I will use recent_N (N=5, including the pre-game samples and P1-P2) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the lead time + review period (2+1=3 periods).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a type of trouser. Inventory is currently 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Customer demand over the last 8 weeks (including pre-game samples) has averaged ~128 units/week. However, since the game started, we have seen demand of 149, 150, and 115. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (183 units) are expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible at the start of P4. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is likely at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and consistent demand (stockouts in P1-P3), there is high urgency to build stock. I will explicitly set L to 3 to reflect the observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (P3, P2, P1 plus two pre-game samples) to capture the current demand level of approximately 139 units/week, scaled by (1+L). This lead-time adjustment will increase the OR backend's target base stock to account for the longer pipeline needs.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a pair of 5-pocket ankle-length jeans. Looking at the historical demand samples (65, 117, 162, 118, 146) and the concluded game periods (149, 150, 115, 173), demand is relatively stable but shows slight growth as we enter the spring season. The promised lead time is 2. Our history shows the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). However, the Period 1 order (183 units) has NOT arrived as of the end of Period 4; since it was placed in Period 1 with a promised L=2, it was expected in Period 3. Its absence at the start of P5 suggests it might be delayed or potentially lost. I will use L=recent_N (N=1) based on the confirmed arrival of the P2 order which was 2 periods. For demand (mu_hat), the last 4 periods have an average of 146.75, which is consistent with the recent samples. I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture this stable post-initialization demand. I will maintain a standard sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for recent volatility. The current in-transit is 397 (P1: 183, P3: 101, P4: 113). Since P1 is likely missing/delayed, the OR backend needs to ensure we cover the lead time + 1 demand cycle. Setting L=2 explicitly reflects the most recent confirmed lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS', a garment item. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: P5 demand was 225, up from an average of ~140 in P1-P4. This suggests a seasonal shift into Spring. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) and missing an arrival from Period 1 (ordered P1, promised L=2, should have arrived in P3 or P4). However, Period 2's order arrived correctly in P4 (L=2). The Period 3 order (101 units) is expected to arrive this period (P6). Because demand has jumped to 225, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the trend while being cautious. I will set L to 3 to account for the potential delay seen in the missing P1 order, which forces the OR backend to maintain a larger pipeline buffer. Sigma is set to default as the standard deviation of recent samples is broadly consistent with the mean shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: P5 demand (225) is ~60% higher than P1-P3 average (~138). Missing shipment from Period 1 (183 units) is overdue.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The item is a 'Slim Mom Denim', likely seeing spring seasonality. Historical demand shows a significant increase: P1-P4 averaged 146.75, while P5-P6 averaged 195.5 (+33%). The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals are unstable: P2 arrived in 2 periods (P4), P5 arrived in 1 period (P6), and significantly, the P1 order (183 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. The P3 (101 units) and P4 (113 units) orders are also late compared to the promised 2-period lead time. With 0 on-hand inventory and consistent stockouts (sold < demand in P5 and P6), we must aggressiveley forecast for the new demand regime (approx 195-200 units/week) and account for the unreliable supply chain. I am setting L=3 to account for the current delays and using the last 2 periods of high demand to set mu_hat. This will increase the safety stock and base stock level to recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: P1 order (183 units) confirmed lost (overdue by 4 periods). Lead time is volatile; P5 order arrived in 1 period, but P3 and P4 are currently delayed > 2 periods. Demand regime stabilized at higher level (~195 units/week) since P5.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU has 0 units on-hand and 850 in-transit. The history shows significant supply chain disruption: the Period 1 order (183 units) is confirmed lost, and orders from Period 3 (ordered 5 periods ago) and Period 4 (ordered 4 periods ago) have yet to arrive, despite a promised lead time of 2. While Period 5 arrived in 1 period, the inconsistency suggests we should use an explicit lead time estimate of 3 to account for current delays. Demand has shifted from an early average (~140) to a higher regime (~175) starting in Period 5, coinciding with the spring season for denim trousers. To address the 'In-transit' bloat (850 units) while accounting for the lost Period 1 shipment and current stockout, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current demand stabilization (~177 units/week) and explicit L=3 to ensure the OR logic covers current transit risks. High sigma_hat (recent_N=3) is used to reflect the volatility in demand since Period 5.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption continues: Period 1 shipment lost; Period 3 and 4 shipments delayed > 4 periods. Effective lead time estimated at 3 periods due to inconsistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $852.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 starts with on-hand inventory of 192 units. Historical analysis reveals significant supply chain instability. The Period 1 order (183 units) is confirmed lost. Period 3 and 4 orders (101 and 113 units respectively) are significantly overdue (now 6 periods and 5 periods ago), so they should be discounted from reliable pipeline inventory calculations. Recent arrivals (Period 6 and 7 orders) showed lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, but the inconsistency remains high. Demand shows a clear upward trend with the last observed demand at 261 units. To prevent stockouts caused by lost or delayed shipments and increasing demand, I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a buffer for the OR backend's base-stock calculation. mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the higher demand regime established since Period 5 (avg ~198). sigma_hat is set to explicit (140) to account for the high volatility in both demand and lead-time-induced supply gaps.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: P1 order lost; P3 and P4 orders (214 units total) are >5 periods overdue and likely lost. Effective planning must assume a higher lead time (3) to buffer against these pipeline failures. Demand has shifted higher, averaging ~198 since Period 5 compared to ~138 in periods 1-3.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the demand remains in a higher regime than the initial weeks. Since Period 5, demand has averaged approximately 189.8 units/period (225, 166, 139, 261, 158), compared to 138 in periods 1-3. The supply chain has been highly unstable: exports from Period 1 (183 units), Period 3 (101 units), and Period 4 (113 units) are significantly overdue (6-9 periods) and are now confirmed as lost. Recent arrivals (P5, P6, P7) show lead times of 1-2 periods, but the frequency of lost shipments necessitates a more conservative approach. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for this historical unreliability and ensure the base stock covers a wider window. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 5 periods (since the regime shift) to calculate a mean of ~190, which for (1+L)=4 periods results in 760. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly over the recent 5 periods to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure update: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are definitively lost (>6 periods overdue). Period 5-9 demand confirms a stabilized higher-demand regime averaging ~190 units/week.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/04/22. Demand analysis shows a shift in the regime starting Period 5; since Period 5, demand has averaged ~183 units/week (range 115-261). The most recent demand (Period 10) was lower at 115, but given the volatility and previous spikes (P5: 225, P8: 261), we must remain cautious. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern. Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 297 units) are confirmed lost as they are >6 periods overdue. However, recent shipments (P5, P6, P7, P9) arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods. I will set the effective lead time (L) to 2 periods to cover the promised duration while accounting for potential short-term variability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the higher-demand regime observed since Period 5 (P5-P10), ensuring the OR engine calculates base stock based on the ~183 average rather than the lower P1-P4 mean (~146). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the significantly higher volatility (std dev ~53 since P5 vs ~24 before).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain performance has bifurcated: early orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, while recent orders (P5-P9) show lead times of 1-2 periods. Demand stabilized at a higher mean (~183) with significantly higher volatility since Period 5 compared to the start of the year.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29th, 2019. The 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' (5-pocket jeans) shows a clear seasonal pattern in demand. History confirms a high-demand regime since Period 5 (start of March), averaging ~162 units/week (P5-P11), compared to the earlier Jan/Feb period. Supply chain issues have stabilized: while P1, P3, and P4 orders are confirmed lost, recent shipments (P2, P5, P6, P7, P9) have arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 123, with 499 units in-transit (orders from P10 and likely P12 upcoming). Although promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time has frequently been 1 period recently (P5, P7, P9). However, because of the historical volatility and lost shipments, I will maintain L = 2 for safety. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the shift that occurred since mid-March, excluding the initial lower demand. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to account for the higher volatility observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovered from disruption: P5-P9 orders handled correctly with 1-2 period lead times, confirming early losses (P1, P3, P4) were isolated incidents. Demand regime remains elevated compared to Q1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has exited the high-demand volatility seen in March/April. Recent demand samples show a significant downward trend: Period 10 (115), Period 11 (109), and Period 12 (84). This suggests a transition from a peak spring period into a quieter phase. The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~103 units. Regarding lead time, early losses (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed isolated events; more recent orders (P6, P7, P9) arrived with lead times of 2, 1, and 1 respectively. Consequently, I am reverting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (currently ~1.4 for successful deliveries). I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent cooling of demand, preventing overstocking while maintaining a buffer for the current on-hand of 39 and in-transit of 499 (which includes the high P10 order).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase detected: Weekly demand dropped from ~190 (P5-P9) to ~103 (P10-P12), a 45% reduction. Supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time averaging 1.4 periods over the last 5 successful arrivals.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (P10-P13) shows a significant cooling phase compared to the high-demand regime of March/April. Demand has dropped from an average of ~183 (P5-P9) to an average of ~93 in the last 4 periods (115, 109, 84, 63). We are out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline remains heavy (499 units in-transit), driven by an order of 102 units in P10 and subsequent orders not placed due to high inventory. Lead times have mostly stabilized at ~1.5 periods (averaging last 5 arrivals). However, the critical task is to align mu_hat with the new, lower demand level to avoid over-ordering as current stock-outs are likely temporary pending arrivals. We use recent_N=4 to capture the specific cooling trend since P10.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~183 (P5-P9) to ~93 (P10-P13), a ~49% reduction. Lead time stability remains at ~1.5 periods for recent successful shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Historical data confirms a significant demand cooling phase starting around Period 10, with the most recent four periods (P11-P14) averaging ~80 units/week, compared to the ~180-190 units/week seen in the mid-Spring peak. The product is 'Slim Mom Denim TRS', and as we move further into May, the peak demand observed in early April (P8) has clearly subsided. Regarding supply, orders from P1, P3, and P4 are long lost and removed from practical pipeline consideration. Recent lead times have stabilized between 1-2 periods. I am currently out of stock (0 on-hand) with 499 units in-transit (this includes a large order from P10 of 102 units and potentially older un-concluded units that are likely lost). Given the demand drop, mu_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the current mean of ~80. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time of ~1.5 periods seen in recent successful arrivals, which will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering during this low-demand, high-pipeline phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Average demand P11-P14 is ~80 units/week, down ~58% from the Period 5-9 peak of ~190.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has significantly cooled as we approach the end of May. Analysis of the demand history reveals a clear cooling regime: the peak period (P5-P9) averaged ~190 units/week, while the most recent five periods (P11-P15) have averaged ~76 units/week (80, 63, 65, 59). In P15, demand was 59 units. The supply chain has settled after early-season losses, with recent successful arrivals (P2, P5, P6, P7, P9) showing lead times of 1 or 2 periods (mean ~1.4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 499 units in-transit (predominantly the P10 order of 313 plus smaller earlier residuals, though P1/P3/P4 are assumed lost). Given the high cost of holding ($1) relative to profit ($4), and the 499 units in-transit which are sufficient to cover roughly 6 weeks of current demand (~76/week), I am using 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the cooling phase and setting Lead Time to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average performance (~1.4 periods) which is more aggressive than the promised 2 periods, helping to prevent over-ordering while waiting for the large in-transit pipeline to arrive.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '448509001' (Slim Mom Denim TRS) has entered a low-demand phase consistent with the end of the spring season. Since Period 11, demand has continuously declined from 109 to 47 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P13-P16) is ~58.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 499 units in-transit, which is extremely high (equivalent to ~8.5 weeks of current demand). Over-ordering must be avoided to minimize holding costs given the $1.0/unit/period rate. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' as the recent logistics performance has stabilized at 1-2 periods. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (~58.5/week) and ensure the OR backend's target base stock accounts for the massive pipeline relative to this new cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase has deepened: Average demand P13-P16 is ~59 units/week, a ~68% drop from the P5-P9 peak (~183-190). Pipeline inventory (499 units) is now significantly excessive relative to the current demand regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a deep demand cooling phase as the season progresses into June. Demand has declined steadily from a peak of ~190 in Period 5 to just 40 in Period 17. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 54.8 units. The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.5) for recent orders, though earlier orders (P1, P3, P4) remain lost. Currently, there are 499 units in-transit (from an order likely placed around Period 10, which is overdue but could arrive any time). With on-hand inventory at 0 and current demand at ~55/week, the 499 units in-transit represent over 9 weeks of cover, which is excessive given the declining trend. To prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime and setting L to calculate to capture the actual observed lead time stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase has deepened: Average demand (P13-P17) is ~55 units/week, a ~71% drop from the P5-P9 peak (~190). Pipeline inventory (499 units) is extremely high relative to the current sales rate.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand for SKU 448509001 has entered a sustained cooling phase, with recent demand dropping to 30 units in Period 18. The average demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) is approximately 44 units/week. However, a significant operational hurdle exists: the system reports 499 units in-transit, which are definitively lost shipments (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10) based on lead-time analysis. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the 'base stock' to determine the order quantity, and 499 units far exceeds the true demand requirements (approx. 150 units for a 3-period window), the backend will continue to order 0 units unless the base stock is set explicitly high to 'override' these ghost units. To resume replenishment and avoid further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to 650. This value is calculated to cover the ghost pipeline (499) plus approximately three weeks of current demand (3 * 50 = 150), ensuring the backend places an order. I am using recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility of the current cooling regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a deep cooling phase: P15-P18 average is ~44 units/week (down ~77% from P5-P9 peak). Pipeline inventory of 499 is confirmed as 'ghost units' (lost shipments) including the P10 order. Explicit mu_hat adjustment is required to trigger ordering.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for the SKU 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' has significantly cooled, from a peak of ~190 units/week (P5-P9) to an average of ~33 units/week over the last 3 periods (P17-P19). The 'In-transit' figure of 671 units is composed of 499 'ghost units' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P10) and 172 units ordered in P19. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is currently low but present, we need to bypass the 'ghost units' inflating the pipeline inventory. The OR backend uses 'order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. Since (671 + 0) is much larger than any reasonable base_stock for a 40-50 unit demand regime, the backend will not order. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5: P15-P19) to capture the true current demand (~42 units/week). To ensure an order is actually placed to replenish the 0 on-hand stock (since the P19 order won't arrive until P21 or P22), I will maintain the L=2 setting as a safety buffer. Note: the system is essentially blocked by the 499 lost units; using 'explicit' overrides is usually the only way to force an order if the pipeline is permanently clogged, but the prompt asks for standard parameterization where possible.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 671 includes 499 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10) that will likely never arrive, effectively blocking the standard OR backend from ordering. Mean demand has stabilized in a 'deep cooling' phase at ~40 units/week (P16-P19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a 'deep cooling' demand phase, with the average demand over the last four periods (P17-P20) dropping to ~31 units per week. The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 671 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 499 of these are 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10). The remaining 172 units were ordered in Period 19. With a promised lead time of 2, these units should arrive in Period 21 (visible in Period 22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the backend OR logic functions despite the 'ghost' pipeline inventory blocking new orders, I must set mu_hat explicitly. The backend logic is: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. It then subtracts pipeline_inventory (671). To trigger an order or maintain appropriate stock levels when on-hand is 0, mu_hat must be high enough to exceed the 671 ghost units + current demand needs. However, since 172 units are actually expected next period, and the demand is very low (~31), let's set mu_hat to cover the ghost units plus a buffer for the cooling regime demand (3 periods * 31 units = 93). 671 + 93 = 764.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost units in pipeline confirmed at 499 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand cooling persists: P17-20 average is 31 units/week.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 22 shows zero on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 778 units. The pipeline consists of 499 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10) and 279 real units from recent orders (P19: 172 units, P21: 107 units). Demand has stabilized at a 'deep cooling' level; the average demand for P18-P21 is 31 units/week. To allow the OR backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the distorted pipeline (which the backend sees as 778 units). I will set explicit mu_hat = (1+L) * 31 * K, where K accounts for the ghost units. With 499 units lost, the backend's effective pipeline check (Base Stock - 778) prevents ordering. To bridge this, mu_hat is set to (3 * 31) + 499 \u2248 592 to target a base stock that triggers an order despite the 499 ghost units. Using L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P5-P9) returned to 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=4 to reflect the low volatility in this cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Ghost units in pipeline remain at 499 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand regime continues in 'deep cooling', averaging ~31 units/week (P18-P21). Period 19 order (172 units) is due to arrive in Period 22 arrival phase (visible P23).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we observe on-hand inventory is 0. However, the Period 19 order (172 units) and the Period 21 order (107 units) should arrive in coming periods. The In-transit total of 778 consists of 499 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10) and 279 valid units (P19=172, P21=107). Current demand is highly volatile; after several periods in the 20-40 range, Period 22 saw a spike to 97. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is ~44 units/week. Since the pipeline inventory is effectively blocked by the 499 ghost units, the OR backend's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] will not place orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed 778. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1100 to force the backend to account for the ghost units while ensuring we maintain stock for the current demand regime (~44 units * 3 periods = 132 units needed). L is set to calculated as recent lead times have stabilized.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand volatility increased (P22 demand spiked to 97 from a plateau of ~31). Ghost units (499) continue to inflate the pipeline inventory and block standard replenishment logic.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Situation: Current on-hand is 16. In-transit inventory of 1037 units contains significant 'ghost' or lost units. Specifically, orders from P1 (183), P3 (101), P4 (113), and P10 (102) never arrived and are over 10 periods overdue, totaling 499 units. Additionally, the P19 order (172 units) is now 5 periods overdue, which is considerably longer than the promised 2 periods or the recent sample of 2 periods (P21 order arrived P23). Given this, 671 units (499 + 172) are highly likely lost or extensively delayed. 

Demand Context: Demand has exited the 'deep cooling' phase (~31-40 units) and spiked significantly in the last two periods (P22: 97, P23: 91). This suggests a mid-summer demand resurgence for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim', potentially correlating with peak retail season for denim. 

Strategy: To trigger replenishment through the OR backend, mu_hat must be set 'explicitly' at a level that offsets the 671 ghost units in the pipeline. If we target a base stock of roughly 3 periods of demand at the new ~95 average (~285 units) plus a safety buffer, we must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - pipeline) generates an order. Since pipeline (1037) - ghosts (671) = 366 effective units, and we just ordered 366 in P23, we should maintain a high mu_hat to ensure we reach the targeted service level during this demand spike. I will estimate mu_hat based on the current 2-period demand spike (avg ~94) and set the OR parameters to reflect this new regime, while using an explicit L=3 to account for the recent unreliability and losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence detected: P22-P23 demand (avg 94) is ~3x the previous cooling phase average (~31). Ghost units in pipeline increased to 671 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be plagued by lost shipments. In-transit inventory of 1138 units contains 671 high-confidence 'ghost units' (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19 which is 5 periods overdue). These units must be ignored by and bypassed in the OR logic by inflating mu_hat. Demand has rebounded from the 'deep cooling' phase (~31 units/week) to a 'resurgence' phase (P22-P24 average is 84 units/week). The Period 21 order (107 units) arrived in P23 with a 2-period lead time, but Period 19 remains missing. To offset the 671 ghost units and cover the new demand regime (approx. 84 units/week) over the 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=3), I calculate a target base stock of approx. 671 (offset) + (84 * 3) = 923. Setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method allows us to force the backend to place orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'ghost units' (lost shipments) increased to 671 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Demand resurgence confirmed: P22-P24 average demand is 84 units/week, up from the cooling phase average of ~31.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be plagued by 'ghost units' (lost orders) that haven't arrived. Currently, orders from P1 (183), P3 (101), P4 (113), P10 (102), and P19 (172) are all severely overdue (P19 is now 7 periods old). Total ghost units are estimated at 671. The current 'In-transit' of 1138 is composed of these 671 ghost units plus active orders from P23 (366) and P24 (101). Since the OR backend uses pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, these 671 ghost units will block any new orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset them. Demand has transitioned from a cooling phase (~30 units/week) to a resurgence phase (P22-P25 average is ~83 units/week). To trigger replenishment in the face of 671 ghost units and a demand of ~83/week with a 2-period lead time, the required 'base stock' must exceed 671. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 850 (roughly 10x current weekly demand) is a tactical bypass to force the OR backend to place an order despite the phantom pipeline, ensuring the on-hand inventory doesn't remain at zero during this demand resurgence.

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'ghost units' (lost shipments) confirmed at 671 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). These units block standard replenishment logic. Demand resurgence confirmed: P22-P25 average demand is ~83 units/week, up from the cooling phase average of ~31.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In-transit inventory (772) is dominated by 671 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) which are significantly overdue and unlikely to arrive. These ghost units prevent the OR backend from ordering by falsely satisfying the base stock requirement. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand has clearly resurrected since Period 22, with the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaging approximately 90 units per week. The date (mid-August) suggests late-summer demand for denim trousers remains strong. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * 90, where L=2, totaling 270. With on-hand inventory at 246 units and the real pipeline (P24 order of 101) providing another 101 units, the total real inventory is ~347. Setting mu_hat to 270 prevents unnecessary ordering this period while the system digests the arrival from P23 (366 units). I will continue to monitor the P24 and P23 orders to evaluate if lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand resurgence solidifies (Avg P22-P26: ~90 units/week). Ghost units in pipeline remain at 671 (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Lead time for recent arrivals (P21, P23) suggests L is 2-3 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is currently in a significant resurgence phase as we move into late August (Back-to-School season). The demand reached 182 units in Period 27, marking a clear escalation from the Period 22-26 average of ~90 units. This mirrors the high-demand regime seen earlier in the year (P5-P9). Inventory management is severely complicated by 772 units in-transit, of which 671 are 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) that will never arrive. The OR backend's replenishment logic is blocked by these ghost units. To force an order and bridge the on-hand gap until the Period 24 order (101 units) arrives, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate 'true' demand at ~185 units/week. Given a lead time of 2-3 periods (L=3 to be safe), I need a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods, approximately 740 units. Since on-hand is 64 and effective pipeline is only 101, I must bypass the ghost units (671) by adding them to the mu_hat calculation. Explicit mu_hat = (185 * 4) + 671 = 1411. This should trigger a necessary replenishment order to meet the rising seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence has significantly accelerated, reaching 182 units in Period 27 (Date: 2019/8/12), likely driven by seasonal back-to-school shopping. Ghost units in-transit remain at 671 (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' is surging due to the August Back-to-School season, with the last two periods showing 182 and 158 units respectively. Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1194, but this is heavily distorted by 671 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) that have never arrived. To allow the OR backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline inflation. Based on the demand resurgence (P27-P28 avg = 170) and a lead time of 2 (setting L=2), mu_hat is calculated for (1+L)=3 periods of coverage: 170 * 3 = 510. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the perceived pipeline, triggering a replenishment order to meet the high seasonal demand while on-hand remains at zero.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School seasonal surge confirmed: Demand in late August (P27-P28) averaged 170 units/week, up from ~90 in early August. Ghost units in pipeline remain at 671.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak of the 'Back-to-School' seasonal surge (August/September). Demand has significantly spiked: Period 27 (182), Period 28 (158), and Period 29 (114), averaging ~151 units/week over the last three weeks, compared to the previous 'resurgence' average of ~90. The in-transit pipeline of 1194 reflects 671 'ghost units' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) which are effectively lost and must be offset. Additionally, an order of 422 units was placed in P28 and is expected to arrive around P30/P31 (L=2-3). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the ghost units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to set a high base stock. Based on a mean demand of ~160 (accounting for the surge) and a lead time of 2, the required inventory to cover L+1 (3 periods) is approximately 480 units. By setting mu_hat to 1200, I effectively offset the 671 ghost units and target a service level for the current 480-unit demand window.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School seasonal surge confirmed: Late August/Early September demand (P27-P29) is averaging 151 units/week. Ghost units in pipeline remain at 671 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand phase driven by the 'Back-to-School' and early autumn season, with demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) averaging 154 units. Historical data suggests this is significantly higher than the mid-summer 'deep cooling' phase. Pipeline management remains critical: current 'In-Transit' inventory is 837 units, but 671 of these are confirmed 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19) that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline consists only of the Period 24 order (101 units) and the Period 30 order (65 units). The Period 24 order is now significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering), suggesting it might also be lost, but I will monitor for one more period before classifying it as a ghost. Lead time for the most recent successful arrival (P28 order) was 2 periods. To ensure the OR backend orders despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime (~155 units/week) across the lead time plus review period (1+2=3 periods). Given the 671 ghost units that the backend incorrectly subtracts from the base stock, mu_hat must be boosted to offset this 'pipeline inflation' so that the final order calculation triggers correctly.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-School/Autumn demand surge confirmed: P27-P30 average demand is 154 units/week. Total 'ghost units' in pipeline remains 671 (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Period 24 order (101 units) is now highly suspect as lost (7 periods overdue).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has settled into an Autumn/Back-to-School regime following the August surge. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 151 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 122 units. The in-transit pipeline of 923 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost units' from lost orders: P1 (183), P3 (101), P4 (113), P10 (102), P19 (172), and Period 24 (101). Total ghost units = 772. The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P30 (65) and P31 (86), totaling 151 units. To prevent the OR backend from being blocked by the 772 ghost units in the 'in-transit' figure, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (L+1) * 151 + buffer. With L=3, target base stock for a ~150 mean should be around 750-800. Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit), and current (on_hand + in_transit) = 1045, I must use an explicit mu_hat that forces the base stock above 1045 to trigger necessary replenishment as demand remains high. I estimate a requirement of ~1200 to ensure continuity, though the cap may limit the final order.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost units in pipeline confirmed at 772 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Demand regime for Autumn has stabilized at ~150 units/week (P27-P31 avg: 151).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized in an 'Autumn/Back-to-School' phase, with the last 6 periods (P27-P32) averaging 148 units/week. This is a significant increase from the summer cooling phase. The supply chain has stabilized for recent orders, with lead times of 1-2 periods for orders placed in P28, P30, and P31. However, the in-transit pipeline (922 units) is severely inflated by 'ghost units' (lost shipments) from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, and 24, totaling 772 units. These units will not arrive but prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it perceives a high pipeline. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Ghost_Units. With L=2 and mean demand ~150, (3 * 150) + 772 = 1222. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock level high enough to account for the dead inventory and still trigger new orders to meet the current demand surge.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim TRS' has surged significantly in late September (Period 33 demand: 275), likely reflecting a seasonal peak or promotional event. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P27-P33) is approximately 167 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). The in-transit pipeline of 1120 units is severely compromised by 'ghost units'\u2014lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P24, totaling 772 units. These lost units trick the OR logic into thinking the pipeline is full, preventing necessary replenishment. To force the OR backend to place an order, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L) * (average demand + ghost units/ (1+L)). With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * (167 + 772/3) \u2248 1272. This adjustment compensates for the phantom inventory. I am setting L to 2 periods based on the most recent successful arrivals (P30, P31, P32).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand peak detected at P33 (275 units), increasing the Autumn plateau average from ~150 to ~167 units/week. Total 'ghost units' in pipeline remain 772 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn demand regime with an average demand of approximately 178 units over the last 8 periods (P27-P34). The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in P34. In-transit inventory of 1350 is highly misleading due to 772 'ghost units' (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24) which have not arrived for 7+ periods and must be discounted. The active pipeline consists of orders from P32 (150), P33 (198), and P34 (230), totaling 578 units. Observed lead times for recent successful arrivals (P28, P30, P31) have been 1-2 periods. I will set L to 2 to maintain stability. To bypass the OR engine's 'ghost unit' logic block, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the current demand regime (~178/week) plus a significant adjustment to account for the 772 lost units, effectively 'forcing' an order by raising the target base stock above the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to capture the increased volatility of the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost units in pipeline confirmed at 772 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Autumn demand regime (P27-P34) averages ~178 units/week, significantly higher than the previous Summer trough.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-autumn demand regime (Period 36, mid-October). The 'ghost units' in-transit (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24) totaling 772 units have not arrived and are significantly past any reasonable lead time, effectively blocking the OR backend's replenishment logic as it perceives a massive pipeline surplus. Recent actual demand (P27-P35) has averaged approximately 158 units/week, with a peak of 275 in P33. To bypass the 'ghost unit' block and ensure the OR engine places orders to meet this sustained higher demand level, I am setting 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value. I've calculated the target base stock needed: (1+L)*Mean Demand + Z*Sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=2 (promised/recent avg), Mean=158, and Z ~ 0.84 (for 80% service level), base stock is ~580. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1352 (which is 580 + 772 ghost units), the backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly yield a replenishment order. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual recent lead time variability (ranging 1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total 'ghost units' (lost in-transit) confirmed at 772 units. Replenishment logic requires explicit mu_hat inflation equal to these 772 units to offset the false pipeline inventory and maintain a base stock for the current ~158 units/week demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in an Autumn demand regime (P27-P36) averaging ~148 units/week, though recent demand has softened (79 units in P36). The primary challenge continues to be the 'ghost units' in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24), totaling 772 units. These orders are significantly past any reasonable lead time and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (1164 units) from the calculated base stock, it will fail to place new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset these 772 non-existent units. Current on-hand is 183. To target a base stock covering ~3 periods (L=2 + 1) of demand (~150 * 3 = 450) while neutralizing the 772 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1222 (450 + 772). This ensures the backend clears the 'pipeline' hurdle and maintains availability. Actual lead time has fluctuated between 1-3 periods, so L is set to 2 to reflect the average recent performance (P28, P30, P31, P32, P33).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost units in pipeline remain at 772 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Demand for October shows a cooling trend (P36: 79) compared to the September peak, but still requires significant replenishment due to pipeline distortion.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-peak Autumn cooling phase, with demand dropping from a late-September peak of 275 to an average of ~86 units/week over the last two periods (P36-37). However, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost units' in the pipeline inventory. Currently, in-transit inventory is 1164. Based on history, 772 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). The remaining 392 units in-transit consist of orders from P34 (230 units, now 4 periods old and potentially delayed/lost) and P36 (162 units, expected soon). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders; with 1164 units falsely appearing in the pipeline, it will not order. To force replenishment for the actual demand regime (estimated at ~100/week to be safe), I must inflate mu_hat significantly. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock for (~100 units * 3 periods) + Ghost Units (772) + Suspect P34 units (230) \u2248 1300. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat ensures the backend clears the 'pipeline' hurdle. I will set L to 2 (promised) and sigma_hat to a value reflecting the recent volatility (~45).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: In-transit 'ghost units' (lost shipments) potentially increased to 1002 units, as the Period 34 order (230 units) is now 4 periods overdue with no arrival. This continues to block the OR engine's replenishment logic.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from lost shipments ('ghost units') which have reached a total of 1002 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and now P34, which is 5 periods overdue). Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts in-transit inventory from the base stock, these ghost units prevent new orders from being placed. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand 0). Demand for the last 4 periods (P35-P38) has adjusted to a mean of approximately 104 units/week following the Autumn surge. To bypass the inventory blockade, I am setting 'mu_hat' explicitly. I calculate the required base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=2 + 1 review period) at 104 units/week (~312 units) and add 1002 units to offset the false pipeline. Total mu_hat = 1314. Lead time calculation is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average of 2-3 periods for successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total 'ghost units' (lost in-transit) significantly increased to 1002 units after Period 34 order (230 units) surpassed expected lead time by >3 periods. Demand has stabilized at a post-peak level of ~104 units/week (P35-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Denim TRS) is currently in a post-Autumn cooling phase, following the Back-to-School surge in late August/early September. Evaluation of the last 4 periods (P36-P39) shows an average demand of ~92 units/week. However, the simulation remains severely distorted by 'ghost units' in the pipeline inventory. By analyzing the history, orders from P1 (183), P3 (101), P4 (113), P10 (102), P19 (172), and P24 (101) are significantly past any reasonable lead time and are confirmed lost (772 units). Furthermore, the order from P34 (230 units) is now 6 periods overdue, increasing total ghost units to 1002. With in-transit at 1188, only 186 units (P38 and P39 orders) are 'real'. Because the backend subtracts the full 1188 from the base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 1002 ghost units. Targeted base stock = (1+L)*demand + ghost units. With L=2 and demand ~92, base stock needs to be ~1278. Setting mu_hat to 1278 ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 1188 in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total 'ghost units' (lost shipments) confirmed at 1002 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and now P34). These units permanently inflate pipeline inventory, requiring explicit mu_hat inflation equal to current desired base stock + 1002 to trigger replenishment. Demand has cooled to ~92 units/week post-autumn peak.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Perrie Slim Mom Denim' has cooled significantly following the autumn peak, averaging approximately 75 units/week over the last 5 periods (P36-P40). However, the replenishment logic remains severely hampered by 1,002 'ghost units' in-transit (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and now P34 which is 6 periods late). These units are officially in-transit but logically lost. To force the OR backend to order, I must set mu_hat explicitly. This explicit value must cover the base stock for the current demand regime (Target: ~3 periods of demand = 3 * 75 = 225) PLUS the 1,002 ghost units that are falsely subtracting from the order quantity. Therefore, mu_hat = 225 + 1002 \u2248 1227. I am using L=2 (default) but estimating mu_hat based on the total pipeline correction needed. sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility seen during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost units in pipeline reached 1002 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P34). Post-autumn demand has cooled further, averaging ~75 units/week since P36.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly cooled post-autumn peak, with the last 6 periods (P36-P41) averaging ~63 units/week, and the most recent 3 weeks (P39-P41) averaging ~56 units/week. Supply chain performance remains consistent for recent orders (P36 and P39 arrived with lead times of 3 and 2 respectively). However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 1184 is heavily distorted by 1002 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and P34). These lost units block the standard OR replenishment logic. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that equals the current target base stock for a ~60 unit/week demand regime (approx 3 periods of demand = 180) plus the 1002 ghost units. This will signal the backend to maintain a small physical safety stock while accounting for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation to handle current volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new patterns detected; total ghost units remain at 1002.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we see a significant demand spike (274 units) in Period 42, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales (November 29). This follows a 'cooling phase' where demand averaged ~65 units/week. While on-hand inventory is 0, the pipeline inventory of 1184 units is heavily distorted by 1002 units 'ghost units' (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P34). The actual valid pipeline consists of orders from P38 (114), P40 (32), and P41 (36), totaling 182 units. To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the 1184 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1450. This value accounts for the current demand spike and the necessary offset for the 1002 ghost units. I also set L to explicit 2 (the promised lead time which has held for recent successful arrivals) and sigma_hat to reflect the increased holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 demand reached 274 units (Black Friday effect), ending the post-autumn cooling phase. Total ghost units in pipeline remain at 1002 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P34).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing a complex supply chain environment with 1,002 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P34). These units permanently occupy in-transit slots, preventing the backend OR logic from ordering unless target levels are explicitly inflated. We just satisfied the tail end of the Black Friday surge (P42=274, P43=108). Lead times for recent successful arrivals range from 2-3 periods (Average ~2.5). Inventory is currently zero on-hand. We must maintain replenishment for the December/Holiday demand. I am using an explicit mu_hat set to 1500; this value accounts for the desired base stock for the current demand regime (around 450-500 units) plus the 1,002 ghost units. This shift ensures the OR logic 'sees' a need for new orders despite the false pipeline data. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical instability, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the high volatility seen during the autumn/holiday peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike (Black Friday) confirmed: P42 demand reached 274. Ghost units in pipeline solidified at 1002 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P34). Successive lead times for arrivals in P39-P43 have been 2, 3, 2, 3, and 2 periods, suggesting a stable but longer actual lead time than the promised 2.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in the holiday/December shopping period (P45, Dec 16). Recent demand has spiked significantly due to Black Friday/Holiday effects (P42: 274, P43: 108, P44: 163), ending the post-autumn cooling phase. The pipeline inventory (1596 units) is heavily distorted by 'ghost units'\u2014lost shipments that will never arrive but block replenishment in the OR backend. These ghost units are confirmed as Orders P1 (183), P3+P4 (214), P10 (102), P19 (172), P24 (101), and P34 (230), totaling 1002 units. Actual lead times for recent successful arrivals have stabilized between 2-3 periods. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 1002 ghost units inflating the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 4 periods of the current high demand regime (~180 units/week to be safe for late December) plus the 1002 ghost units. Base stock target = (4 * 180) + 1002 = 1722. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent recent delays.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: P42-P44 demand average is 181 units/week (+140% vs P39-P41). Ghost units in pipeline remain at 1002 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak Holiday demand season (Period 46, Dec 23). Recent demand (P42-P45) has averaged ~178 units/week, driven by Black Friday and Christmas shopping. In-transit inventory is currently 1486 units, but this is heavily distorted by 1002 'ghost units' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P34). These dummy units block the OR engine's replenishment logic because it perceives a massive pipeline that will never arrive. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a target base stock that ignores these lost units. My goal is to cover (L+1) periods of demand at the current holiday rate (~180/week) plus a safety buffer for volatility. With actual lead time L averaging ~2.4 periods recently, I target a base stock of ~750 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1752 (Current Target 750 + 1002 Ghost Units). This ensures the backend calculates an order by seeing that (Base Stock 1752 - Pipeline 1486) > 0. Sigma_hat is set to default as the backend's standard deviation calculation is sufficient given the explicit mean shift.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand regime confirmed: P42-P45 demand averages ~178 units/week. Ghost units in pipeline remain at 1002 (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, P34), requiring explicit mu_hat inflation equal to (Target Base Stock + 1002) to maintain replenishment.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in the middle of the holiday demand regime. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is approximately 141 units/week, reflecting a significant uplift from the pre-holiday cooling phase. The pipeline inventory is severely distorted by 'ghost units'\u2014orders that have exceeded a reasonable lead time and are likely lost. These include P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24, and P34, totaling 1002 units. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1617) from its calculated base stock; to counteract this 1002-unit phantom inflation and ensure actual replenishment occurs, I am inflating mu_hat. I target a base stock covering (L+1) weeks of demand. With L=3 (to be conservative given recent volatility) and an average demand of 145, a standard base stock would be ~580. Adding the 1002 ghost units gives a target of ~1582. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1582 to force the backend to place an order that considers on-hand (101) and valid in-transit units, effectively bypassing the blockage caused by lost shipments. Sigma is set to reflect the high volatility during this peak period.
