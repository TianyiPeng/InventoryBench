There is a clear upward trend as we move away from early January. The average demand over the last three weeks is approximately 26 units. Given the date is February 11, we are approaching the spring season where denim typically sees steady demand. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover the next 3 periods of demand (current period + 2 periods lead time), and accounting for 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I need to place an order. Based on the recent average of 26 units/period, 3 periods of demand equals 78 units. I will order 80 units to establish a baseline inventory and provide a small buffer for the upward trend.",

Average demand over the last 3 recorded points (P-1, P0, P1) is roughly 31 units/period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Order placed in P1 (80 units) is expected to arrive at the start of P3 (Resolution) and be visible in the P4 decision phase. Current on-hand is 0. Since I am deciding for P2, and the P1 order won't arrive until after the P2 demand resolution, I will have a stockout in P2 as well. To cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods of demand), I need to account for approximately 3 * 40 = 120 units in the pipeline. I currently have 80 in-transit. Therefore, I need to order an additional 40 units to ensure future demand is met, while adjusting for the fact that the 'Ankle' style may see even higher demand as spring approaches.",

In the game periods (mid-late February), demand exploded into a much higher regime (43 in P1, 179 in P2). This sharp increase likely corresponds to the transition into the spring fashion season where 'ankle-length' and 'washed denim' products typically peak. Promised lead time is 2 periods.

Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 120 in-transit. I have missed 222 units of demand (43+179) due to 0 starting inventory and lead time. To satisfy future demand (expected at ~180 units/period based on P2) and build safety stock for this high-demand regime, I need to cover Period 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 periods).

Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed: P1 (80), P2 (40), P3 (400). According to the timeline: Order P1 (80) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost.

Historical demand shows clear seasonality: a massive spike in late summer (P23-P28 averaging ~95 units) cooling down to a stable late-autumn regime. Over the last 9 periods (P31-P39), demand has stabilized at an average of 33.3 units/period, with a tight range between 24 and 40 units. Using this mean for a 3-period lead time window (L+1 = 3), the required pipeline inventory is approximately 100-110 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 47 units. The in-transit pipeline officially shows 1370 units, but the vast majority of this (1150+ units) stems from old, unrecovered orders from earlier in the year which were previously confirmed lost. Recent reliable arrivals (Period 37 order arrived in P38, Period 36 order arrived in P39) suggest lead times are currently 1-3 periods. Active reliable in-transit orders are from P38 (50 units) and P39 (50 units). On-hand (47) + Active In-transit (100) = 147 units. This covers over 4 periods of demand at the current regime. Therefore, no new order is placed this period to avoid increasing holding costs while the current pipeline resolves.",
  "carry_over_insight": "November demand regime remains stable at ~33 units/period (P31-P39 evidence). Recent lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.",

The relevant in-transit pipeline consists of orders from P38 (50 units) and P39 (50 units), totaling 100 units. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted demand of 30 units/period, I require 90 units. Current inventory + reliable in-transit (23 + 100 = 123) is sufficient to cover this demand and provide a buffer for lead-time variability. Therefore, no new order is placed this period to avoid overstocking and further holding costs as we approach the end of the game (P41 of 47).",

The reliable pipeline includes an order from P38 (50 units) which is now 4 periods old and potentially delayed or lost. Given the current on-hand inventory (42) and the stabilized demand (~30), we have enough stock for the immediate period. However, given the high frequency of shipment losses and a lead time of 1-3 periods, a small safety order is warranted to prevent a stockout in Period 44-45, while keeping holding costs low.

Late November and December typically see a second smaller peak or steady demand due to holiday gifting and winter fashion across many retail markets. Period 42 showed a significant demand surge to 62 units, likely reflecting early December/holiday shopping, up from the mid-November average of ~30. Current on-hand inventory is 0. My in-transit pipeline (1370 units) is heavily inflated by historically lost shipments. Confirmed lost orders include: P1(80), P3(400), P4(150), P10(60), P19(150), P23(150), P24(150), P25(150), P26(150), P29(80), P30(80), P31(80), P34(50), P37(40), and potentially others. The only reliable recent orders are from P38 (never arrived, likely lost), P42 (50 units), and the current P43 order. Given the recent surge to 62 units and the consistent loss of shipments, I need to order aggressively to secure stock for the December period while assuming the majority of 'in-transit' units will never arrive.

Period 42 showed a significant jump to 62 units, followed by a drop to 24 units in Period 43. Given the date is now Dec 9th, we are in the peak holiday shopping window. Historical demand for similar events suggests a potential high-volume period followed by a post-holiday lull. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods) and the shipment loss rate for this SKU is exceptionally high (>80% based on game history). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent orders are P42 (50 units) and P43 (150 units). To satisfy expected demand for the next 3 periods (covering the rest of December), and accounting for the high probability of shipment failure, I will place an additional order. The target is to have at least 150-200 units available for the immediate holiday peak.

Based on seasonal retail patterns, a secondary surge or stable demand is expected through the end of December for gifting, followed by a post-holiday drop. The current demand regime is estimated at ~30-40 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1620 units is misleading, as at least 1520 units are confirmed lost from orders placed in the first three quarters of the year.
