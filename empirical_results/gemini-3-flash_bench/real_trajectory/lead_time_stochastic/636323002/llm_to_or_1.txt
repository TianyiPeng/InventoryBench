Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The historical demand for SKU 636323002 (Ladies Denim Ankle-length jeans) shows a significant upward trend: 1, 3, 27, 17, 34. The mean of all historical samples is 16.4, but the most recent 3 samples (27, 17, 34) average 26, indicating a regime shift that aligns with the lead-up to spring fashion demand in mid-February. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend calculates base stock for (L+1) periods, which is 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime (avg ~26/week * 3 weeks = 78) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to account for the increased volatility (std of 27, 17, 34 is ~8.5). Since there is no lead time history yet, I will use 'default' for L.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is 'Ankle-length jeans', a staples item for ladies' denim. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: 1, 3, 27, 17, 34, and most recently 43 in Period 1. This suggests a transition from a low-demand introduction phase to a higher-volume established phase. In Period 1, we ordered 41 units (currently in-transit) but had a demand of 43, resulting in 43 units of lost sales due to 0 starting inventory. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive in P3 (visible in P4). For P2, since we have 0 on-hand and the P1 order is still in-transit, we need to set parameters based on the recent high-demand regime. I will use the last 4 samples (27, 17, 34, 43) which average ~30 units/period to inform mu_hat. This targets a service level geared towards the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), ensuring we rebuild inventory once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-21: average demand increased from ~2 to ~30 units/period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (Ladies Denim) is experiencing a severe demand surge. Historical data (pre-game) showed demand rising from 1 to 34. Since the game started (Period 1-2), demand has exploded to 43 and then 179 units/period, coinciding with late February. This suggests a seasonal spring transition for denim. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 90 units are in-transit (41 from P1, 49 from P2). With a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order (41 units) is expected to arrive during the upcoming Period 3 (visible in P4 start). Given the massive demand of 179 in P2, the previous orders are insufficient. I must drastically increase the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg of 43, 179, and the pre-game 34 is ~85 units/period). For lead time, I will stick to 'default' (2 periods) until evidence suggests otherwise, and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility seen in the transition.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed: Period 2 demand spiked to 179 from a Period 1 demand of 43, indicating a move into a high-volume seasonal regime for this denim SKU.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for this Ladies Denim SKU, with demand over the last three periods averaging 119.3 units (43, 179, 136). The initial historical samples (1-34) are no longer representative. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 309 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (41 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible now (Period 4 start). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead time delay or a lost shipment. Given the stockout and the high demand, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the current high-volume seasonal regime while ignoring the low-volume pre-season data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay observed: Order from Period 1 (promised L=2) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude, suggesting actual L >= 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $931.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a ladies' denim item. Historical demand showed a significant regime shift starting Jan 21, and recent data from Periods 1-4 shows high but volatile demand (43, 179, 136, 67). The average demand over these 4 periods is 106.25. Regarding lead time, the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), however, the Period 1 order (ordered Feb 11) has not yet arrived as of Period 4 conclude. This suggests the Period 1 order is either significantly delayed (L > 3) or lost. Because the Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2), the 'calculate' method for L is appropriate as it will incorporate the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the very low pre-Jan 21 values. Sigma_hat will also use N=4 to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 5 update: Period 1 order is confirmed missing/lost as Period 2 order (same promised L) arrived first. Demand remains high but highly variable (range 43-179).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a seasonal denim item. The demand history shows a massive regime shift starting in late January, transitioning from single digits to an average of ~92 units per period over the last 5 periods (43, 179, 136, 67, 35). While demand dropped in Period 5 to 35, the overall volatility is very high. Regarding supply: Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4, but the Period 1 order is significantly overdue and likely lost, as later orders would have arrived by now. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 497 units in transit (ordered in P3, P4, P5). Given the lead time seems stable at 2 periods for successfully delivered orders, I will use L=2. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 5 periods to capture the current high-demand regime (mean = 92, and mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 3 * 92 = 276). For volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the last 5 periods to account for the high variance (std ~ 60, and sigma_hat = sqrt(3)*60 ~ 104).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for this skinny denim SKU (late February through March). Recent demand history (samples 1-5 provided in prompt + gameplay periods 1-6) shows a significant shift from low single digits in early January to a much higher average. After filtering the initial low-demand period, the average demand over the last 6 game periods is approximately 85.6 units/period (43, 179, 136, 67, 35, 52). Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1's order is lost, Period 2's arrived in 2 periods, and Period 5's arrived in 1 period. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 494 units in transit (orders from Periods 3 and 4). To provide the OR backend with the best parameters, I will use an 'explicit' lead time of 2 (conservative promise) and 'recent_N' for demand (N=6) to capture the higher seasonal mean (~85 per week) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma). This leads to a mu_hat of approx 257 (85.6 * 3).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high in this high-volume regime (range 35-179). Lead time is volatile but appears to average around 1.5-2 periods when orders aren't lost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The product is a high-waisted skinny ankle denim, currently in a high-demand spring phase. Historical data (pre-game + Periods 1-7) shows a significant demand shift from ~2 to an average of ~79 units/period since late January. Specifically, the last 6 periods show demand values of [179, 136, 67, 35, 52, 41], averaging 85 units per week. Although demand is cooling slightly from the February peak (179 units), it remains significantly elevated relative to early samples. Inventory status: On-hand is 0, with 494 units in-transit. The Period 1 order (41 units) is definitively lost. The Period 3 and 4 orders (219 and 234 units) are still in-transit; with a promised L=2, the P3 order was expected to arrive in P5 or P6, and the P4 order in P6 or P7. Since they haven't arrived, the actual lead time is currently \u2265 4 periods for these large batches. Parameters: 1) L: Setting 'explicit' to 3 to account for observed delays and pipeline congestion. 2) mu_hat: Using 'recent_N' with N=6 (entire high-demand regime) to capture the current mean of ~85 units/week across the (L+1)=4 period window. 3) sigma_hat: Using 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the high variance seen in this volatile replenishment phase.

Carry-over insight: Significant replenishment delays: Orders from Period 3 and 4 (large batches total 453 units) are \u2265 2 periods overdue, suggesting lead time has stretched to at least 4 periods for bulk denim replenishments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a denim jeans SKU currently in a high-demand spring regime (averaging approx. 85 units/period since the surge). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. Crucially, orders from Period 3 (219 units) and Period 4 (234 units) are now 5 and 4 periods overdue respectively, compared to the promised lead time of 2. These 453 units represent the bulk of the in-transit inventory (534 total). Given the 'Carry-over Insights' regarding missing/lost shipments (Period 1 order never arrived), I am treating these overdue units as potentially lost or significantly delayed. For Period 9, I set L=4 (explicit) to reflect the observed stretch in lead time for large batches and to encourage the OR backend to place a larger replenishment order to bridge the gap. For demand (mu_hat), I use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the high-volume regime since late January while smoothing the extreme volatility (range 35-179). For sigma_hat, I also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the high standard deviation observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: In-transit orders from Period 3 and 4 (453 units) are \u2265 4 periods overdue; continuing to monitor for total loss vs. severe lead-time extension to 5+ periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/15. The SKU 'Ankle-length jeans' is in its peak spring season. We are facing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The pipeline inventory is very high (634 units), but shipments from Period 1 (41 units), Period 3 (219 units), and Period 4 (234 units) are significantly overdue. Period 1 is confirmed lost. Period 3 and 4 orders are now 6-7 periods since placement, far exceeding the promised L=2. However, Period 2 arrived on time (L=2) and Period 5 arrived early (L=1), suggesting 'random' loss or severe bottlenecks for large bulk orders rather than a consistent lead-time shift for all orders. Since the backend OR uses pipeline inventory to calculate order size, and 634 units are 'in-transit', the OR will likely order nothing unless we adjust L or mu_hat. I will set L to 'explicit' 4 to reflect the recently observed delays in bulk shipments and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer risk window. Demand is high but volatile (avg ~75 in recent periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this high-volume regime since late January, excluding the initial noise.

Carry-over insight: Bulk replenishment orders (Periods 3 and 4, totaling 453 units) are now \u2265 6 periods overdue as of Period 10, indicating a potential 'lost' status or extreme logistic bottleneck for high-volume shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the SKU (Skinny H.W Ankle Queens Denim) is in a high-volume, highly variable demand regime (avg ~61 units/period since the surge, range 23-179). In Period 10, we finally received 140 units from recent orders (P8 and P9), leaving us with 117 on-hand. However, the bulk orders from Period 3 (219 units) and Period 4 (234 units) are now 7-8 periods overdue. Following the logic established in previous insights where Period 1 (41 units) was confirmed lost when P2 arrived first, these missing 453 units are highly likely lost or indefinitely stuck in a logistics bottleneck. If these were ignored, the OR engine would assume enough stock is coming and stop ordering. Therefore, I will treat the 'In-transit' as effectively empty or unreliable. By setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 2 (ignoring the 'lost' anomalies) and using 'recent_N' (N=8) for mu_hat (to capture the current demand level of ~75/week while excluding the initial low-demand phase), I ensure the backend calculates a base stock sufficient to trigger new replenishment orders despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Bulk orders from Period 3 and 4 (453 units) are now 7+ periods overdue and confirmed as lost/unreliable, as subsequent orders from Period 8 and 9 have already arrived. Pipeline inventory figures are currently misleading.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU (Ladies Denim) is in a high-demand regime with high volatility. We have 93 units on-hand. The pipeline inventory (494 units) is highly misleading because 453 units (from Period 3 and 4) are over 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost/stuck, as newer orders from P8/P9 have already arrived. Only the 41-unit order from Period 1 and any very recent orders should be considered active, but effectively the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard includes these ghosts. To force an order and ignore the phantom pipeline, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but keeping mu_hat aligned with the recent mean. Since sales have recently dipped (23, 24 units), N=5 for demand captures the volatility while acknowledging the recent slowdown. This ensures the base stock calculation doesn't assume we have 494 units coming.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/5/6), the item 636323002 (Skinny H.W Ankle Jeans) is entering a period where historical data from the same time in 2019 showed relatively low demand (samples suggest 23, 24, 22 units in recent periods). The current demand regime reflects a cooling trend compared to the earlier high-volume spike (up to 179 units). On-hand inventory is 71 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of recent demand. Pipeline inventory (494 units) is significantly inflated by 453 units from Periods 3 and 4 that are confirmed lost (7-8+ periods overdue while later orders arrived). Excluding these ghosts, the actual pipeline is 41 units (from Period 1). However, Period 1 is also likely lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is near zero. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly assuming a massive pipeline (494 units) and blocking new orders, I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' to cover expected demand over the lead time plus review period (1+2=3 periods). Given recent average demand of ~23, I expect 3 * 23 = 69 units. Since on-hand is 71, no new order is strictly needed yet, but I'll set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current stable demand level while monitoring for replenishment.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' in the Ladies Denim category is currently experiencing a cooling demand regime following a high-volume seasonal peak that lasted from Period 2 (Feb) to Period 8 (April). Recent demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) has plummeted to an average of 19.25 units/period (23, 24, 22, 8), a significant drop from the previous high-volume average of ~80+. On-hand inventory is 63, which covers over 3 periods of recent demand. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 494 is highly misleading; 453 units from orders in Periods 3 and 4 (219 and 234 units respectively) are now over 10 periods overdue and confirmed as lost, as orders from Periods 8 and 9 arrived long ago. This leaves 41 units (from P1) as also likely lost. Effectively, there is near-zero reliable pipeline inventory. However, given the current demand slowdown and $1.00 holding cost, there is no immediate risk of stockout. I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture the current lower demand regime, and using explicit lead time of 2 (the reliable historical average for non-lost shipments) to ensure the OR engine doesn't over-order based on the 'lost' pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed at Period 14: mean demand dropped from ~80 to ~20 units/period starting Period 10. Pipeline inventory of 494 units is entirely unreliable (lost/stale).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/5/20), the item (Skinny Denim) has transitioned out of its high-demand seasonal peak. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 10; the mean demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is approx. 20 units/period (23, 24, 22, 8, 23). The in-transit inventory of 494 units consists entirely of orders from Period 1 (41 units), Period 3 (219 units), and Period 4 (234 units). These orders are between 11 and 14 periods overdue, whereas subsequent orders (P8, P9) arrived in 1-2 periods. I have confirmed these 494 units as 'lost' or 'dead pipeline'. Because the OR engine calculates order quantities as (Base Stock - Pipeline), these phantom 494 units are preventing any new orders from being placed. To correct this, I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' to bypass the standard logic and force a replenishment order. Calculations: Desired Base Stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1) at ~20 units/period = 60 units. Current On-hand = 40. To trigger a replenishment of approximately 20 units while the system thinks I have 494 in transit, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers (On-hand + Ghost Pipeline + Desired Order). I will set mu_hat explicitly high to clear the ghost inventory hurdle and target a sustainable safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed ghost pipeline of 494 units (from P1, P3, P4) is blocking orders; demand is stable in the low regime (avg 20 units/period).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). The SKU 'Skinny H.W Ankle Queens' has transitioned into a lower demand regime (avg ~19 units/period since Period 10). The current in-transit inventory of 540 units is misleading: 494 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost or stuck indefinitely based on subsequent successful deliveries from P5, P8, and P9. This 'ghost' pipeline prevents the OR backend's capped order policy from triggering new orders because it perceives a massive surplus. To bypass this and ensure stock availability for the current demand regime, I must significantly inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. With a current demand of ~19 units and a lead time L=2, a standard base stock would be ~57. However, the ghost pipeline of 494 units must be mathematically 'offset' so the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) produces a positive result. By setting mu_hat to 600, I account for the expected demand while neutralizing the 494 'lost' units, allowing the system to place small replenishment orders. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the lower volatility of the current regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand regime (relative to the early spring spike), but Period 16 showed a sudden spike to 93 units. Given the seasonality of denim, this could be a late-spring clearance or a secondary peak. However, the moving average since Period 10 is approximately 23 units/period (23, 24, 22, 8, 23, 18), making Period 16 an outlier. I will use recent_N=7 for demand to incorporate the spike without overreacting. Regarding logistics: the 'In-transit' balance of 596 is dominated by 494 'ghost' units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (41+219+234), which are 13+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock calculation, these 494 units are preventing the system from placing necessary new orders. To bypass this 'ghost' pipeline, I set L=explicit at a very high value (13). This forces a much larger mu_hat (L+1 * demand), which should exceed the 494 units and trigger a positive replenishment order to cover the current 0 on-hand stock and actual projected demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18 (2019/06/10), we are managing a denim SKU where demand has shown high volatility. Recent demand (P16: 93, P17: 69) suggests a significant upward shift from the previous 'low' regime of ~20 units/period observed between P10 and P15. The 'In-transit' figure of 494 units is comprised entirely of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that is confirmed lost/void in previous carry-over insights; because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, it will prevent all new orders unless we override the parameters. To ensure the backend places orders despite this ghost pipeline, I will set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus current on-hand, covering the 3-period risk window (L+1=3). Given the recent demand spike, I am forecasting a mean of ~80 units per period. L=1.5 is a realistic average lead time based on the most recent successful arrivals (P15 order took 2 periods, P16 order took 1 period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime upshift detected at Period 18: mean demand returned to high-volume levels (~80 units/period) after a 6-period low-demand phase. The 494 units of 'In-transit' inventory remain confirmed as lost and must be bypassed in parameter calculations.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is skinny high-waisted denim, starting its high-demand summer phase. Period 18 saw a demand of 52 units while being stock-out constrained (33 units available vs. 69 previously), confirming a return to high-volume regime. Mean demand per period is roughly 80 forecast. However, there is a critical inventory calculation issue: 494 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are permanently lost (confirmed 'ghost inventory') but are still counted in the 'In-transit' total of 887. Actual reliable pipeline is only 393 (from Period 18). Total In-Transit (887) - Lost (494) = 393. To force the OR backend to place an order when it sees 887 in-transit while only 393 is real, I must set the target base stock (mu_hat) significantly higher to offset the 494 lost units. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 80 = 240) PLUS the 494 ghost units to trigger replenishment. 240 + 494 = 734. Setting mu_hat to 740 to ensure we replenish and account for high volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand for this denim SKU has entered a high-volume phase again, with the last 4 periods averaging ~70 units (93, 69, 52, 68). The inventory situation is complicated by a known 'ghost pipeline' of 494 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) that are confirmed lost. In-transit shown is 594, but subtracting the 494 ghost units leaves an actual pipeline of 100 units (from Period 19). On-hand inventory is 325 units. Since the OR engine's 'capped policy' subtracts the full pipeline (including lost units) and uses promised lead time (L=2), I must set L and mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock and ensure the engine orders enough. I will use L=explicit 2 (promised). For mu_hat, the calculation needs to cover (1+L) = 3 periods of demand (approx 210 units). However, because the backend will see 594 in-transit + 325 on-hand = 919 pipeline, and the target base stock is usually much lower, it will not order. To force an order that replenishes stock despite the ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds (On-hand + Visible Pipeline). Target inventory should be based on 3 periods of demand (~210) plus safety stock. To bypass the 494 ghost units, I will set mu_hat significantly higher this period to offset the invisible deficit.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified ghost pipeline remains at 494 units. Current demand regime stabilized at ~70 units/period over the last 4 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime (avg ~70-80 units/period) following a lower-demand phase in May. Historical data shows that demand spiked significantly starting late January (Period 2), then stabilized between 30-100 before a temporary dip. We are now seeing demand of 69, 52, 68, and 99 over the last four periods (avg ~72). A critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline: Period 1 (41), Period 3 (219), and Period 4 (234) orders are 17+ periods overdue and confirmed as lost. These 494 units must be excluded from pipeline considerations. Current on-hand is 226, and the only valid in-transit order is from Period 19 (100 units), totaling 326 'real' units. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 2 periods. To avoid the OR backend being misled by the 494 'ghost' units, I set L=2 (promised) and adjust mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of the current demand regime. With an average demand of ~72 and a 3-period horizon (L+1), mu_hat should be ~216. However, to compensate for the OR backend's inventory calculation (which sees 226 + 594 = 820 units vs. the real 326), I will use 'explicit' values to force a replenishment if needed, or maintain levels. Since 326 units covers just over 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate, and lead time is ~2, we are currently safe, but must prepare for the next order cycle once real inventory dips.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a high-volume denim item in a peak season. Demand Analysis: The most recent regime (starting Period 18) shows high demand: 52, 68, 99, 132 (avg ~88). I will use N=4 to capture this current high-volume trend. Inventory Analysis: On-hand is 94. The 'In-transit' figure of 594 is deceptive; 494 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/ghost units from over 15 periods ago. The only valid pipeline unit is the 100-unit order from P19. Thus, effective pipeline = 100. Calculating mu_hat: With actual L averaging 2 (despite some 1-period arrivals), effective coverage needed is (L+1) = 3 periods. 3 * 88 = 264. To offset the OR engine's use of the ghost 494 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = 3 * 88 + safety stock. Given high volatility (sigma ~34), a safe base stock is ~350-400. However, the backend sees 594 in-transit. To force an order and maintain availability, I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - ghost_pipeline) reaches the target. Setting mu_hat to 850 (effectively 850 - 494 = 356 towards the OR logic) to ensure replenishment.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 23 (July 15). Demand is in a high-volume regime (avg ~80-100 units/period). Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has been [69, 52, 68, 99, 132, 97], showing a clear upward trend and high volatility. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is reported at 857 units. However, there is a confirmed 'ghost pipeline' of 494 units from periods 1, 3, and 4 (41+219+234) which are lost and will never arrive. Additionally, the order of 100 units from P19 is now 4 periods old (promised L=2); while not yet confirmed lost like the earlier bulk orders, its absence is concerning. Valid pipeline is at most 363 (P19=100?, P22=263). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 857 units of 'In-transit' from the target base stock, it will effectively order nothing unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 494 lost units. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to force a correction: targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1 review period) at ~95 units/period (~285 units) plus the 494 lost units, totaling approx 779 units. This ensures the backend places an order to replenish the 0 on-hand inventory despite the misleading pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: P23: Ghost pipeline persists at 494 units (P1, P3, P4). Order from P19 (100 units) is now 2 periods overdue (L=4 vs promised L=2), possibly joined the lost pool or indicates logistics lag for batches >100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2257.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime (avg ~105 over the last 5 periods: 68, 99, 132, 97, 126). The 'In-transit' of 599 units includes a significant amount of 'ghost inventory' from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 494 units), which were previously confirmed as lost. Additionally, the order of 100 units from Period 19 is now 5 periods old (exceeding the promised L=2 and the typical L=1 seen recently), suggesting it may also be lost. By setting L to 5 using the 'explicit' method, I communicate to the OR engine that it should ignore the 599 units currently in the pipeline (since 'piped' units are only counted if they were ordered within the last L-1 periods). This forces the engine to place a fresh order to cover the (L+1) demand window based on the current high-demand regime, while effectively bypassing the stalled pipeline. This is critical as the on-hand inventory (137) is insufficient for more than one period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Confirmed ghost pipeline of 594 units (P1, P3, P4 totaling 494, plus P19 totaling 100) is blocking replenishment; the OR backend must be forced to ignore these by setting explicit L > actual delay.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019-07-29), the SKU 636323002 is in a high-demand regime, averaging 99.6 units per week over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). The inventory system is severely compromised by a 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units: 41 (P1), 219 (P3), 234 (P4), and now 100 (P19). The P1, P3, and P4 orders (494 units) are over 20 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The P19 order (100 units) is now 6 periods overdue (promised L=2) and is also likely lost or severely delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock to calculate new orders, this ghost inventory of 594 units blocks all necessary replenishment. To bypass this, I am setting an explicit lead time L=10. This increases the mu_hat (target stock) to (1+10) periods of demand, which will exceed the 594-unit ghost pipeline and force the system to place an order. Based on the current regime mean (~100), mu_hat is set to 1100 (100 * 11). sigma_hat is set to 330 (~30% of mu) to provide a safety buffer against the high demand volatility (74-132 recently).

Carry-over insight: P25: Ghost pipeline status updated to 594 units (added P19 order of 100 units, now 6 periods overdue). The high-demand regime continues (avg ~100/period).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (Ladies Denim) is in a high-demand regime with demand averaging approximately 100 units/period over the last 4 periods (97, 126, 74, 90). The 'In-transit' figure of 863 units is misleading because it includes 594 'ghost units' from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19 that are significantly overdue and presumed lost or stuck in a long-term logistics bottleneck. The actual reliable pipeline consists only of the order from Period 23 (5 units) and Period 25 (264 units), totaling 269 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these 594 ghost units as available supply and thus suppressing new orders, I am setting the lead time L to 'explicit' with a value of 10. This higher L increases the base stock target (mu_hat calculation) and forces the backend to continue ordering to meet demand despite the inflated pipeline inventory. I am using mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand average (~97 units) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the sustained volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: P26: High-demand regime remains stable (avg ~100/period). Total ghost pipeline inventory increased to 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) and remains unreliable.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime, with the average demand over the last 10 periods being approximately 90 units (P17-P26: 69, 52, 68, 99, 132, 97, 126, 74, 90, 94). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 991 units is highly compromised. It includes: 494 units from P1, P3, P4 (confirmed lost, >20 periods overdue); 100 units from P19 (now 8 periods overdue, likely lost); 264 units from P25 (placed 2 periods ago, promised L=2); and 133 units from P26 (placed last period). Excluding the 594 units of confirmed ghost inventory, the 'functional' pipeline is 397 units. To force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 991 pipeline) to place an order, I must set the base stock level to exceed 'on-hand + actual pipeline + desired order'. I am setting L=10 as an 'explicit' value; while actual lead time is likely 1-2, this high L value increases the calculated base_stock \u03bc\u0302 enough to overcome the ghost inventory dampening effect. For \u03bc\u0302, I am using an explicit daily forecast of ~100 units multiplied by (1+L), totaling 1100, which ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the 991 'In-transit' figure, triggering replenishment for the current high-demand phase (August/Late Summer).

Carry-over insight: P27: Ghost pipeline remains 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19). High-demand regime (avg ~90-100/period) confirmed over the last 10 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging approximately 99 units per period over the last 10 periods (P18-P27). Lead times for recently received orders are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P22: L=1, P23: L=3, P25: L=2). The 'In-transit' pipeline of 869 units includes 594 'ghost' units from periods 1, 3, 4, and 19 that are confirmed as lost or severely delayed and should not be relied upon for replenishment. To bypass this, I will set 'L' to an 'explicit' high value of 10. By setting L to 10, the OR backend's inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 594 lost units as part of a massive pipeline required to cover an 11-period window (L+1). This forces the engine to target a much higher base stock, effectively allowing new orders to be placed despite the presence of the ghost inventory. I am using the mean of the last 10 periods (~99.4) to set mu_hat and a recent standard deviation of ~25.5 to capture the high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost pipeline updated to 594 units (P1, P3, P4 totaling 494, plus P19 totaling 100). High-demand regime (avg ~100/period) sustained for 10+ periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-volume demand regime remains stable for SKU 636323002 (Skinny Jeans), with an average demand of approximately 98 units per period over the last 11 periods (P18-P28) and a standard deviation of about 21. Currently, there is a significant 'ghost' pipeline of 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) confirmed as lost or severely delayed, which continues to block the OR backend's replenishment logic because the system counts them as live in-transit inventory. To bypass this, I am setting an explicit lead time L=10. This creates a very large base stock target (11 periods of demand), which forces the OR backend to place new orders despite the 1011 total in-transit units (of which only 417 units from P26, P27, P28 are reliable). Setting L=10 and using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we maintain stock for the high-demand regime while correcting for the inventory data discrepancy.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' (Ankle-length jeans) is currently in a stable high-demand regime, with an average demand of approximately 93 units per period over the last 10 periods. However, the inventory management is complicated by a significant 'ghost' pipeline of 594 units (from periods 1, 3, 4, and 19) that are confirmed as lost or severely delayed and will not arrive. As of Period 30, the 'In-transit' figure is reported as 1060 units. This includes: the 594 ghost units, 133 units (P26), 142 units (P27), 142 units (P28), and 49 units (P29). The true actionable pipeline is only 466 units. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, I will set 'L' to an explicit value that exceeds the aging of the ghost units (e.g., L=10). This bypasses the logic where the backend would otherwise stop ordering. I will set 'mu_hat' to (L+1) * 93 and 'sigma_hat' to represent the typical volatility in this regime, ensuring the base stock level remains high enough to cover demand while accounting for the unreliable system-reported inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 is currently in a sustained high-demand regime, with demand averaging ~96 units over the last 10 periods (P21-P30). Recent arrivals (P27 and P28 orders) arrived in 3 and 2 periods respectively, reinforcing an average actual lead time of 2-3 periods. However, a significant 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (from P1, P3, P4, and P19) remains in-transit but is confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on the arrival of multiple subsequent orders. Currently, the system shows 876 units 'In-transit', but only 282 units (from P26, P29, P30) are likely real. To ensure the OR backend places necessary orders despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 15. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the 'In-transit' units that have been delayed longer than 15 periods. I will use the last 10 samples to capture the stable high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: P31: Ghost pipeline of 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) remains stuck; demand regime is stable at ~95 units/period over the last 10 weeks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '636323002' is in a high-demand regime, though demand has dipped slightly over the last two periods (57 and 37 units respectively). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 88 units/period. The 'In-transit' figure of 1007 units is heavily inflated by 594 units of confirmed 'ghost pipeline' (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) which are significantly overdue and likely lost. Subsequent orders from P27 and P28 have already arrived, confirming these older orders are unreliable. Therefore, the effective pipeline consists of orders from P26 (133 units), P29 (49 units), P30 (100 units), and P31 (131 units), totaling 413 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 594 ghost units, I am setting 'L' to 'explicit' with a value of 10. This forces the base_stock calculation to target a much higher inventory level (11 periods of demand), effectively bypassing the 594-unit blockage while accounting for the recent demand mean of ~88. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime avg, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: P32: Ghost pipeline remains 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19). Demand showed a temporary dip in P30-31 (avg 47) compared to the prior 8-period avg (~98).

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a demand regime characterized by an average of approximately 80-100 units/period, despite a slight softening in the last 3 periods (avg ~43). A critical issue remains: a 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19) that are severely overdue and effectively lost. Currently, 'In-transit' is reported as 776 units, which consists of the 594 ghost units plus more recent orders (P26=133, P29=49). If the OR backend includes the 594 ghost units in its 'pipeline inventory' calculation, it will erroneously believe we are overstocked and stop ordering. To force a replenishment order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting L to 15. This bypasses the logic because the backend sees a massive lead time requirement that necessitates higher inventory levels. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime while reflecting the recent slight dip. Sigma_hat remains default to handle the inherent denim volatility.

Carry-over insight: P33: Demand softened slightly over the last 3 periods (avg 43 vs prior avg 98). Ghost pipeline remains 594 units, necessitating high L parameter to force replenishment.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained demand phase, though the last four periods show a moderate softening (averaging ~43 units/period) compared to the prior high-volume period (~98 units/period). This matches late September seasonality for denim after the peak August 'back-to-school' window. The most significant issue remains the 'ghost pipeline' totaling 594 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19) that have never arrived and are over 10 periods overdue; these must be bypassed because the OR backend's capped policy will subtract them from any new order. To force the backend to place necessary orders, I continue to set L as an 'explicit' value high enough to account for these lost units while ensuring mu_hat reflects the current demand regime. With On-hand at 348 and In-transit at 923 (594 ghost + 329 valid), the physical pipeline is roughly 329 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 4-period mean (~43) to reflect the recent softening, and use a high explicit L to offset the 594-unit pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: P34: Confirmed 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) is permanent. Demand has softened to ~43 units/period over the last 4 periods (P30-P33), shifting from the previous high-demand regime of ~100/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a lower-demand regime compared to the summer peak. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 41 units (57, 37, 36, 40, 34), which aligns with the P34 carry-over insight of ~43 units/period. The 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (from P1, P3, P4, P19) remains a significant issue as it artificially inflates 'In-transit' numbers, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To bypass this, I must set the lead time 'L' to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the age of the oldest ghost shipment (P19 is now 16 periods old). However, setting L too high can lead to erratic order sizes. Instead, I will maintain the strategy of using 'explicit' parameters to ignore the ghost pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the recent demand mean of ~41 units/period for the (L+1) horizon. With a promised lead time of 2, L+1=3. 41 * 3 = 123. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 9) scaled by sqrt(3). I will use a slightly lower mu_hat to prevent over-stocking given the current on-hand of 314 units, which actually covers about 7-8 periods of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: P35: Current on-hand inventory (314 units) provides ample safety stock for the current 41 units/period demand regime. Ghost pipeline remains at 594 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level (~38 units/period) over the last 6 periods (P30-P35), dropping from the previous high of ~100. On-hand inventory is healthy at 278 units, covering several periods of the current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 923 units is heavily inflated by 594 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) which have never arrived and are considered lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost pipeline and refusing to order when real stock eventually runs low, I maintain a high explicit lead time (L=10). This forces the backend to ignore 'In-transit' units that are older than 10 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I use N=6 to align with the current lower-demand regime (starting P30).

Carry-over insight: P36: Confirmed demand regime downshift to ~38 units/period (P30-P35). Ghost pipeline of 594 units remains confirmed; the OR backend must continue to bypass these via high explicit L.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime over the last 7 periods (P30-P36), with an average of approximately 38 units/period, down from the previous peak of ~100 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently high at 401 units, which provides over 10 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. A critical factor remains the 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (from orders in P1, P3, P4, and P19) which are long overdue and confirmed as lost or stuck. Additionally, the in-transit amount of 776 includes the 147 units that arrived in P36 (already accounted for in on-hand) and perhaps most of the ghost pipeline. Since the backend caps orders based on (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of these ghost units prevents necessary new orders. I will use 'explicit' L=10 to effectively tell the backend that current inventory needs to cover a very long horizon before replenishment is considered arrived, though currently, no new orders are needed due to the high on-hand balance. mu_hat is set to 152 (approx (1+promised_L) * 38) to reflect the recent demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~38 units/period (P30-P36). Ghost pipeline of 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) confirmed permanent.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU has stabilized in a lower regime, averaging approximately 34 units/period over the last 8 periods (P30-P37). Current on-hand inventory is 366 units, which is sufficient to cover about 10 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 776 units is dominated by the 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, and P19) plus some newer replenishment orders. Since the on-hand inventory alone far exceeds the required base stock for this low-demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will maintain the explicit L=10 strategy to prevent the OR backend from seeing the ghost pipeline as 'available' inventory and accidentally triggering orders if demand spikes. mu_hat is set using recent_N=8 to reflect the current softened demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 9 periods (P30-P38) is approximately 36.4 units/period, significantly lower than the previous high-demand phase of ~100 units. Current on-hand inventory is 341 units, which covers nearly 9.4 periods of demand at the current rate (341/36.4). The 'In-transit' figure of 776 units contains a large 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19) confirmed lost in previous periods. Even ignoring the ghost units, the recent order from P33 arrived in P36, confirming that the logistics are functional but slow (L=3). Given the high on-hand stock relative to demand and the high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19), the goal is to avoid overstocking. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive in-transit inventory as available supply and prematurely stopping future orders (once current stock depletes), I continue to use an explicit lead time L=10. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the delay, though with current stock levels, no new order is expected or needed this period.

The SKU is in a stable, lower-demand regime (averaging ~32 units/period over the last 10 periods). Current on-hand inventory (312 units) is very high, providing roughly 10 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 776 units is dominated by the 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P19) plus more recent orders that have not yet arrived. Due to the high on-hand balance and the persistent presence of the ghost pipeline, I am setting an explicit Lead Time (L) of 100 periods and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (approx. 32/period). The high L parameter forces the OR backend to treat the ghost units as if they will never arrive within a relevant planning horizon, preventing them from satisfying current demand in the model and properly accounting for on-hand safety. Given the current surplus, no new order is expected or needed.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime stabilized further at ~32 units/period (P30-P39). Ghost pipeline of 594 units remains the primary driver for high explicit L to bypass inventory distortion.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable in a low-volume phase, averaging 31.4 units/period over the last 11 periods (P30-P40). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P36-P40) show a mean of 27.4 units. On-hand inventory is 288 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 9-10 periods of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 827 units is heavily distorted by a 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 19) that are confirmed lost/permanent failures. Additionally, there are 233 units in 'active' transit (P26=133, P29=49, P40=51). While the P26 and P29 orders are significantly overdue (suggesting potential loss), the high on-hand balance minimizes current stockout risk. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 827 units of in-transit inventory as available supply (which would block all replenishment), I will continue to use an explicit L of 10. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the pipeline inventory. Demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) are set using recent_N=11 to capture the stabilized low-demand regime since Period 30.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand remains stable in the late-season lower regime, averaging 31.4 units/period over the last 12 periods (P30-P41), compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~95 units/period. The 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (from P1, P3, P4, and P19) remains confirmed as lost/permanent at 22+ periods overdue. To account for this, I must continue to set an explicit L that is higher than the actual delay of these ghost units to effectively neutralize them in the backend OR logic, ensuring they do not block replenishment. Actual lead time for recent successful arrivals (P30, P32, P36) has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using a window of N=12 to focus on the current stable regime. This approach maintains sufficient on-hand levels to cover the upcoming 5 periods of the game while ignoring the persistent inventory distortion.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2. Demand has shown a significant uptick in Period 42 (62 units) compared to the previous 12-period average (~32 units/period), possibly indicating a holiday-driven surge for denim. The 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (from P1, P3, P4, P19) is confirmed lost and must be bypassed. Total in-transit is 876; subtracting the 594 lost units leaves an active pipeline of 282 units (from P26, P29, P40, P42). On-hand inventory is 195. To ensure the OR backend orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will set an explicit lead time L=20, which effectively forces the calculation to ignore historical pipeline constraints. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 13 periods (P30-P42) to capture the stable lower regime but include the recent spike, resulting in a mean of ~35.4 units/period. Over 21 periods (1+L), this yields mu_hat = 743. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed during demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: A potential holiday demand surge is emerging (Period 42 demand peaked at 62 from a stable base of ~32). Ghost pipeline remains 594 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows signs of a holiday uptick (P42: 62), though P43 returned to the stable base (24). Over the last 14 periods (P30-P43), the average demand is 35.5 units/period. The 'ghost pipeline' remains a critical issue; total inventory in-transit is 825, but 594 units (from P1, P3, P4, and P19) are effectively lost/stale. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 231 units (orders from P29, P33, P40, P42 - although P33 and P40 have arrived). Currently, the active pipeline consists of orders from P29 (49 units) and P42 (49 units), totaling 98 units. On-hand is 222. Total 'real' stock (on-hand + active pipeline) = 320 units. With demand at ~35/period, we have ~9 periods of coverage. However, the OR backend sees 222 + 825 = 1047 units, which prevents any new orders. To bypass this, I will set L to 15 (explicit). This ensures the OR engine's 'cap' and 'base_stock' calculations (which use L) are high enough to potentially trigger orders if needed, though with current high real stock, the primary goal is maintaining visibility. I'll use recent_N=14 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand mean of ~35.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Real pipeline confirmed at 98 units (P29, P42); ghost pipeline remains 594 units (P1, P3, P4, P19). Demand regime average is 35.5 units/period (P30-P43).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are approaching the end of the game (Period 47). Current demand is in a lower regime, averaging 35.5 units/period since Period 30, though we saw a brief peak of 62 units in Period 42. On-hand inventory is 207 units, which covers approximately 5.8 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 825 units is dominated by the 'ghost pipeline' of 594 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 19) which are confirmed lost. Additionally, the Period 29 order (49 units) is now 16 periods overdue and must also be considered lost. The only reliable pipeline is the Period 42 order (49 units). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 643 units of lost inventory (594 + 49) and stopping all new orders, I continue to set an explicit L of 20, which is significantly higher than any actual lead time observed. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the distorted 'In-transit' count. For demand forecasting, I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the steady low-demand regime since Period 30, while also accounting for the volatility observed in the Period 42 spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed ghost pipeline increased to 643 units, as the Period 29 order (49 units) is now 16 periods overdue and likely lost. Demand regime since Period 30 remains stable at ~35 units/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has been in a stable low-volume regime since Period 30, averaging approximately 34 units/period (mean of P30-P45). While Period 42 showed a brief spike to 62, subsequent weeks returned to 15-24 units, suggesting no sustained holiday surge yet. The 'In-transit' figure of 776 units is heavily distorted by a 'ghost pipeline' of 643 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P19, and P29). These lost units must be bypassed to allow the OR engine to place necessary orders. To achieve this, I set L = 25 (explicit), which exceeds the delay of the oldest lost shipment, effectively making the backend consider that pipeline inventory as 'too far in the future' to satisfy current demand, thereby triggering replenishments based on on-hand stock and recent reliable arrivals. For demand forecasting, I use recent_N=16 to capture the stable regime starting from Period 30, and sigma_hat recent_N=16 to account for the reduced volatility in this period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 636323002 (Ladies Denim) is currently in a lower-demand regime that began around Period 30, averaging ~32 units per week over the last 15 periods. There was a brief spike in Period 42 (62 units) likely due to pre-holiday shopping, but demand has since stabilized at very low levels (11-21 units) during the late December period. On-hand inventory is 224 units, which represents approximately 7 weeks of stock at the current average demand (32 units/period). The 'In-transit' count of 776 units is heavily distorted by a 'ghost pipeline' of 643 units from lost or severely overdue orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 19, and 29). The backend OR logic subtracts in-transit from the base stock calculation; to prevent this ghost inventory from blocking necessary future replenishments, I am maintaining an explicit lead time (L) of 25. This ensures the base stock calculation (which scales with 1+L) remains high enough that the ghost inventory does not zero out orders when stock eventually runs low. For this period, given the current high stock-to-demand ratio (224 relative to ~32/week), no new order is required. I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the sustained lower-volume regime of the last few months.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Ghost pipeline increased to 643 units (confirmed loss of P1, P3, P4, P19, and now P29 orders). Current demand regime (P30-P46) remains stable at an average of ~32 units/period despite a brief holiday spike in P42.
