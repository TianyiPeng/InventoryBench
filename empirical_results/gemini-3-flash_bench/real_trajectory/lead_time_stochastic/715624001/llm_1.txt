  "rationale": "Product Description & Calendar: The item is the 'Becka hoodie', a sweatshirt with a drawstring hood and brushed inside. As of Feb 11, 2019, we are in the late winter/early spring transition. Historical demand shows a significant spike starting Jan 28 (215 units) and continuing Feb 4 (302 units), likely driven by pre-spring shopping or late winter replenishment. Demand Analysis: The last two observations (215, 302) represent a regime shift compared to the early January baseline (~37 units). I will forecast demand for the upcoming periods based on this elevated mean, roughly 300 units/period. Lead Time & Pipeline: The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover my (L+1) window (Period 1, 2, and 3), I need enough inventory for 3 periods of demand (approx. 900 units). Current inventory and pipeline are both 0. Inventory Decision: I will place an order to cover the next three periods. 300 units/period * 3 periods = 900 units. To be safe given the upward trend, I'll target 950 units.",

Historically, demand was low in January (avg ~37) but spiked significantly in late January/early February (215 on 01-28, 302 on 02-04). Period 1 (2019-02-11) showed a demand of 131. The timing (mid-February) is post-winter peak but often corresponds with 'spring transition' or late-winter sales in retail. The promised lead time is 2 periods. I placed an order of 950 in Period 1; this is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at Period 4 START). Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 950 in-transit. Because I have 0 on-hand, I lost 131 units of sales in Period 1. I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (the L+1 window). Recent demand suggests a regime of ~150-300 units per week. Total in-transit (950) likely covers the next 3-4 weeks if demand averages 250. However, to ensure I don't run dry if Period 3 demand is high and lead time is exactly 2, I need to maintain the pipeline. I will order another 300 to account for demand in Period 4 and build a small safety buffer against the high variance seen in previous weeks (reaching 302).",

  "rationale": "(a) World Knowledge & Product Description: SKU 715624001 is a 'Becka hoodie,' a basic jersey garment. March in the Northern Hemisphere is a transition from winter to spring; demand for basic hoodies often remains steady but might taper off as weather warms. (b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical demand showed a peak of 302 in early February (2019-02-04), but recent actual demand has trended lower: P1=131, P2=131, P3=76, P4=48. This suggests a post-winter decline or a shift in the mean towards ~100 units/period (c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2. The P2 order (300) arrived in P4 (LT=2). Crucially, the P1 order (950) placed at the start of Period 1 has NOT arrived and did not conclude in Period 4. It should have arrived in P3. Given it's missing for two periods past expected arrival (P3, P4), it is highly likely lost in transit. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand = 252. In-transit = 950 (the likely lost P1 order). Since the P1 order is likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure is unreliable for future arrivals. (e) Order Logic: We need to cover demand for Period 5, 6, and 7 (L+1 = 3 periods). If average demand is ~100 units/period, we need 300 units. On-hand is 252. I will treat the 950 in-transit as 0 and order 150 to ensure we have a fresh pipeline and safety stock, accounting for the possibility that demand stabilizes higher than the very low P4 figure of 48.",

In fashion retail, demand for heavy hoodies typically peaks in late winter (February) and starts to decline as spring approaches. Historical demand confirms this: 302 in early February vs. ~50 in early March. b) Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized significantly lower, averaging 48.5 units over the last two periods (P4 and P5). Forecast for the next 3 periods is approximately 50 units/period. c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (950) is officially lost (expected P3, now P6). The P2 order arrived in P4 (lead time = 2). Current in-transit includes 950 (lost) + 150 (placed P5). Since 950 is lost, effective in-transit is only 150. d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 203. Expected demand for P6, P7, and P8 (Lead time + 1) is ~150 units. e) Final Order Logic: Current on-hand (203) already covers the next 3+ periods of demand. Adding the in-transit 150 units (expected P7) brings supply to 353 units, which is a 7-week supply at current demand levels.

(c) The Period 1 order (950 units) is confirmed lost and is excluded from the active pipeline. (d) Active Pipeline: P13 order (220 units) is expected to arrive this period (P15); P14 order (150 units) is expected to arrive in P16. Current on-hand is 0.

Historically, demand in February (Periods 1-2) was around 131 units. Even if demand spikes to 150-200 units per period for the remainder of the season, our current stock of 1,762 is significantly higher than the maximum possible demand (8 periods * 200 = 1,600). Ordering more would only increase holding costs ($1/unit/period) which are already high given the current inventory level. There is no risk of stockout before the game ends. Therefore, the optimal action is to place no further orders and allow the existing inventory to fulfill remaining demand.",

Since holding costs are $1.0/unit and the lead time is volatile (averaging 2-3 periods), ordering more units would only increase holding costs without providing additional protection against stockouts, as current stock already exceeds the maximum plausible demand for the remaining periods.

My current inventory of 1,350 units comfortably covers the most aggressive demand forecasts for the remainder of the game.

Even at the highest observed demand levels, the inventory is more than sufficient to cover the remaining two periods without risking a stockout. Furthermore, since any ending inventory incurs a holding cost of $1.0/unit, and we expect only about 200-300 more units of total demand, we will already be carrying a significant surplus (approx 900+ units) into the final periods.

However, since there are no more decision periods following this one, ordering is unnecessary. Furthermore, 813 units are more than enough to cover the demand for this final period, even if it remains at peak levels (200-300 units).
