Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-02-11. We are looking at SKU 678342002, a 'Fitted T-shirt' (Jersey Basic). The historical demand shows a significant jump in the most recent week: 22, 11, 20, 13, and finally 41 on 2019-02-04. The average of all samples is 21.4, but the most recent sample (41) is nearly double the previous average, suggesting either a new demand regime or a seasonal upward trend as spring approaches. On-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we don't stock out given the recent spike, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to weight the recent higher demand (avg of 20, 13, 41 is 24.6) more heavily than the full history. For sigma_hat, I will use default to capture the overall volatility including the recent spike. Lead time is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a fitted T-shirt. In Period 1, we ordered 45 units based on initial samples, but demand was significantly higher at 60 units (a common occurrence for basic apparel at the start of a season). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (45 units) is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand samples (22, 11, 20, 13, 41) plus the recent Period 1 demand of 60 show an upward trend and higher volatility. I will use the last 3 samples (including Period 1) to capture this recent increase in demand (41 and 60). N=3 is chosen for recently observed higher demand. For lead time, I will stick with the default (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU 678342002 is a fitted jersey T-shirt. Historical demand was low (avg: 21.2) but has spiked dramatically since Period 1 (60, then 77), likely due to seasonal spring/summer preparation. The promised lead time is L=2. Observations: Period 1 order (45 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in P4 start); Period 2 order (77 units) is expected in Period 4 (visible in P5 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 122 in-transit. Because demand has undergone a significant regime shift (+200% compared to Jan), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 (including the most recent historical point and the two game periods) to capture the higher mean. Since L=2, mu_hat needs to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. The backend will calculate (1+2) * mean(41, 60, 77) = 3 * 59.33 = 178. This will increase the base stock relative to the outdated historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 1 (Feb 11): mean demand increased from approx 21 to 68 units/week (+220%) as spring season approaches.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a fitted T-shirt, which is showing a clear seasonal demand spike as spring approaches. Historical demand samples (Jan-early Feb) averaged ~21, but recent realize demand in Periods 1-3 has been 60, 77, and 98 (mean: 78.33). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 211 in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (45 units), P2 (77 units), and P3 (89 units) are still in transit. Since P1's order was placed with L=2, it is expected to arrive during P3's resolution and be visible at the start of P4. However, the Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0', suggesting a possible lead time delay or simply that the order arrives during Period 4's execution. To be safe, I will use a recent demand window (N=3) to set mu_hat, capturing the upward trend (average ~78). For L, I will stick to 'default' (2) as it's too early to confirm a systemic lead-time shift, but the pipeline (211) is already significant against the zero on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand continues to trend upward: P1-P3 mean demand is 78.3, compared to pre-P1 mean of 21. Stockouts occurring due to rapid demand growth and lead time lag.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (March 11). The product is a 'Fitted T-shirt', which is seeing a massive seasonal spike as we enter spring. Demand has surged from a pre-February mean of ~21 to a current mean of ~81 (P1-P4: 60, 77, 98, 89). We have experienced back-to-back stockouts because current on-hand inventory is 0 and we sold all 77 units that arrived in Period 4. The promised lead time of 2 periods is holding (confirmed by the Period 2 order arriving in Period 4). However, our pipeline is struggling to keep up with the ~300% demand increase. To prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime, and I am increasing sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the expected demand over the next 3 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level: P1-P4 mean demand is 81.0 units (standard deviation ~16), representing a sustained 285% increase over original baseline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (March 18). The SKU is a 'Fitted T-shirt', which is seeing a significant seasonal demand surge as spring begins. Looking at the history, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 1, increasing the mean from ~21 to ~75 units. Period 5 demand was lower (50), but this might be constrained by the massive stockouts seen in Periods 1-5 where on-hand inventory was zero for most of the duration. In terms of lead time, Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), confirming the promised lead time holds. However, Period 1's order (45 units) and Period 3's order (89 units) have not concluded yet. Period 1 is now 5 periods old (well past L=2), suggesting a lost shipment. Because of these lost units and high demand, we have 0 on-hand inventory. The OR backend needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime since Feb 11 (P1-P5) while dampening the effect of the lower P5 data point. I will use 'calculate' for L as the system has confirmed at least one L=2 delivery, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed loss of Period 1 shipment (45 units) as it is 3 periods overdue. Pipeline inventory reconciliation required.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th (Period 7). The product is a fitted cotton t-shirt, which is moving into its peak spring/summer season. Demand shifted significantly in Period 1 but has recently softened slightly (P5: 50, P6: 42), though it remains much higher than the pre-Feb baseline. The Period 1 order (45 units) is now 6 periods since placement and is officially lost, while the Period 3 order (89 units) is also overdue (passed promised L=2). However, Period 5 arrived in just 1 period. Due to this volatility in lead times and the loss of the P1 shipment, I am setting L to 'calculate' to let the engine use historical arrival data. For mu_hat, the recent 5-period mean (P2-P6) is approximately 71.2. Given the seasonal transition, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current high-demand regime while excluding the very first spike in P1 which led to stockouts. Sigma_hat will also use the last 5 periods to account for the increased volatility of the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Lead time variability confirmed: P2 arrived in 2 periods, P5 arrived in 1 period, while P1 (lost) and P3 (overdue) indicate high risk of shipping failure.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), we are in the spring season for a 'Fitted T-shirt', which sustains high demand. Historical analysis shows a clear regime shift: pre-Period 1 demand averaged ~21, while Period 1-7 demand has averaged 69.4 units with significant volatility (std ~18.8). The delivery from Period 3 (89 units) is now 2 periods overdue and the Period 4 order (79 units) is also 1 period over its promised 2-period lead time. Given the Period 1 shipment was confirmed lost previously, the reliability of the current pipeline (248 units) is questionable. Specifically, orders from P3, P4, P5 (re-order), and P7 are in transit. We have 0 on-hand inventory. To prevent further stockouts during this peak season while accounting for lead-time uncertainty, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the high-demand regime since Feb 11. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for the elevated demand and potential pipeline failures, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1=3).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline instability confirmed: Orders from Period 3 and Period 4 are now overdue (3+ periods since order), indicating a recurring pattern of lost or significantly delayed shipments alongside the previously confirmed Period 1 loss.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are seeing sustained seasonal demand for this T-shirt SKU. Recent demand (P4-P8) has averaged 65.2 units, though there is significant volatility and recurring stockouts (on-hand is 0). A critical issue is pipeline reliability: orders from Period 1 (45 units), Period 3 (89 units), and Period 4 (79 units) are significantly overdue and likely lost. The in-transit figure of 232 includes these ghosts. Per logic, P3 and P4 orders should have arrived by P6 or P7; because they haven't appeared in a 'conclude' message, I must treat them as lost to trigger new orders. To force the OR engine to bypass 'on-hand + pipeline' logic that would otherwise block ordering, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand at 75 units/period. With a promised lead time of 2, the window is 3 periods (225 units). Since on-hand is 0 and only the P8 order (19 units) is likely viable, I need to cover the deficit. Setting mu_hat to 350 ensures the base stock calculation overcomes the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipping window confirmed: Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 213 units) are now 4+ periods overdue and confirmed lost, creating a critical inventory deficit despite high recorded 'in-transit' values.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/04/15), the system is facing a severe inventory crisis due to lost shipments. Orders from Period 1 (45 units), Period 3 (89 units), and Period 4 (79 units) are significantly overdue (6, 7, and 9 periods respectively) and are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 378 includes these 213 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 165 units (from Period 8 and 9). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a recent mean demand (P5-P9) of 57.8 units, the 'In-transit' value seen by the OR backend (378) will cause it to under-order or order nothing. To force the necessary inventory replenishment to cover the 3-period risk window (L+1), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that negates the ghost inventory. Target base stock should be ~230 units (approx 4 weeks of demand at ~58/week). Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - in_transit, and in-transit is inflated by 213 units, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger a recovery order. I will use recent_N for L (N=4) to account for lead time variability (average of 2, 0, 1, 1 is ~1.3) and explicit mu_hat to bypass the pipeline distortion.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22nd. Demand for this fitted cotton jersey T-shirt (678342002) has stabilized in a high-demand spring regime. Recent demand (P6-P10) averages 60.6 units/week. Historical lead times show high variability: P5/P7/P9 arrived in 1 period, while P2/P8 arrived in 2 periods. Critically, orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 213 units) are over 6 periods old and confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 326 units includes these 213 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 113 units (the P10 order). With current on-hand (101) and effective pipeline (113), the total effective inventory is 214 units. To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~61/week, we need a base stock of approximately 183 units. However, we must explicitly account for the phantom pipeline inventory (213 lost units) that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. By setting mu_hat explicitly higher, we compensate for the OR engine's 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)' logic, ensuring the system places an order to maintain safety levels despite the inflated pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination resolved: confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, and P4 (213 units) remain in 'in-transit' but will never arrive. Demand regime for P6-P10 shows mean 60.6, std 13.9.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29), we are in a 't-shirt' peak season. Demand from P6-P11 shows a mean of 60.0 units per period (Standard Deviation ~11.5). The pipeline inventory of 333 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, and P4 (45 + 89 + 79 = 213 units), meaning the effective 'healthy' pipeline is only 120 units (P10: 113, P11: 7). To force the OR backend to ignore these ghost units and place an order to cover upcoming demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat. Promised lead time is 2, so the system targets (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Mean demand (60) * 3 = 180 units. Explicitly setting mu_hat slightly higher than the target base stock will compensate for the 213 units the backend thinks are coming but aren't.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand for this T-shirt SKU remains strong as we progress into the spring/summer season, with a mean of 64.2 and standard deviation of 15.6 over the last five periods (P8-P12). The pipeline inventory (384 units) is significantly inflated by confirmed lost orders from Period 1 (45), Period 3 (89), and Period 4 (79), totaling 213 units. These units will never arrive, leaving a functional pipeline inventory of 171 units (384 - 213). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the inventory position covers roughly 2.6 periods of demand (171 / 64.2), which is thin given the recent stockouts. To compensate for the pipeline 'ghost' units and Ensure the OR backend orders enough to reach a safety stock that handles seasonality and unreliable delivery, I will use an explicit lead time of 2 (most common successful LT) and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat values. mu_hat is set to 250 to target a base stock around 275-300 units (accounting for 3 periods of demand + safety), which effectively 'ignores' the 213 lost units in the logic by forcing a higher order volume.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: Verified functional pipeline is 171 units; 213 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and distorting ordering logic. Current demand regime (P8-P12) mean: 64.2, std: 15.6.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 (mid-May). The SKU is a 'Fitted T-shirt', which is in peak demand during spring/summer. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 377 units is heavily contaminated by lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4, totaling 213 units. The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P12 (51 units), P9 (146 units - though P9 is severely overdue and likely lost, I will treat it as ghost inventory for now), and P13 (0 units). Specifically, looking at history: P11 (7 units) arrived in P13 (L=2). P12 (51 units) is expected now or in P15. The demand regime from P8-P13 shows a mean of approximately 70 units (75, 52, 64, 57, 91, 81). To compensate for the 213 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory that the OR engine thinks will arrive (but won't), I must significantly inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To cover 3 periods (L+1) at ~70/period plus the 213 unit deficit, I set mu_hat to 423. Sigma is set to reflect recent volatility (~16 * sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination persists: 213 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, causing the OR backend to under-order unless mu_hat is explicitly adjusted upward. Current demand regime (P8-P13) mean is 70.0 units/period.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 15 (May 20), peak spring/summer season for the 'Jersey Basic Fitted T-shirt'. Demand remains high but varies. Recent demand (P9-P14): [52, 64, 57, 91, 81, 89], mean ~72.3. On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 415 units, but 213 of these (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P10 (113 units - now overdue), P14 (89 units), and the order placed in P13 (0 units). The 113 units from P10 are 4 periods old (promised 2), suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. Because the OR backend subtracts the phantom 'in-transit' units (213 lost + 113 likely lost = 326) from the calculated base stock, it will not place a sufficient order. To override this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate effective demand for the lead time (L=2) + current period (Total = 3 periods) at ~217 units (72.3 * 3). However, to force an order that compensates for the 326 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 543 (217 + 326). This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the corrupted pipeline, triggering a replenishment order to satisfy current high seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Pipeline reconciliation update: P10 order (113 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P1, P3, and P4. Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory is 326 units. Recent demand (P10-P14) mean is 76.4 units/period.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May (Period 16), seeing consistent high demand (mean ~80). The product (fitted T-shirt) is in peak season. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 592 is heavily contaminated by lost shipments: P1 (45), P3 (89), P4 (79), and P10 (113) are all well past their lead times and confirmed lost, totaling 326 'phantom' units. The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P14 (89) and P15 (177), totaling 266 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (592) from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering entirely if we don't intervene. To force an order and offset the 326 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I've set mu_hat to 563, calculated as (1 + 2) * 78 (recent mean) + 329 (compensation for lost units to ensure the OR engine sees a base stock high enough to trigger new replenishment). This will correct for the pipeline contamination and aim for 100% service level during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 326 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) is persisting and requires explicit mu_hat inflation to bypass OR backend logic. Recent demand (P11-P15) remains high with mean 80.2 and std ~12.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: The SKU '678342002' (Fitted T-shirt) is in peak summer demand. Current demand (P12-P16) averages 88.4 units/period. The main challenge is 'phantom' pipeline inventory: orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10 (totaling 326 units) are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. However, the OR backend sees 602 units in-transit (Total In-transit) and subtracts this from the target base stock, leading to zero orders being placed despite having 0 on-hand inventory. To force the backend to place an order, I must calculate a needed mu_hat that compensates for these 326 lost units. The functional pipeline consists of P14 (89 units), P15 (177 units), and P16 (10 units), totaling 276 units. Given the lead time is 2, a target base stock for 3 periods of demand (~88 * 3 = 264) plus a safety buffer is required. To bypass the subtraction of 326 'dead' units and the 276 'live' units from the base stock while targeting a reasonable replenishment, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value (approx 850) that ensures the base_stock calculation minus total in-transit still triggers a necessary order to cover the next cycles of demand and rebuild the safety stock lost due to recent shipment failures.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation at Period 17: Total In-transit (602) contains 326 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10). Functional pipeline is only 276 units. Mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to prevent the OR backend from seeing the lost units as available stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), we are in a high-demand summer regime for this SKU (Fitted T-shirt). Recent demand (P13-P17) has averaged 83.6 units/period. The critical issue remains the massive discrepancy in pipeline inventory. The backend sees 683 units in transit. However, history confirms that orders from P1 (45), P3 (89), P4 (79), and P10 (113) are lost and will never arrive, totaling 326 units of 'phantom' inventory. The functional pipeline consists only of P14 (89) and P17 (268), totaling 357 units. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order, and the backend's view of the pipeline is inflated by 326 units, it will severely under-order or order nothing unless mu_hat is explicitly adjusted. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using an explicit value. The calculation is: Target Base Stock (for L=2) = (L+1) * Expected Demand = 3 * 84 = 252 units. To force the backend to reach this target while it subtracts the inflated pipeline (683) from its calculation, I must provide a mu_hat that offsets the 326 lost units plus the actual demand coverage. However, the OR backend also applies a cap. I will set mu_hat to 578 (252 + 326) to bridge this gap and signal the need for inventory replenishment despite the false 'in-transit' signals.

Carry-over insight: Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains 326 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Functional pipeline as of P18 is 357 units (orders from P14 and P17). Current demand regime (P13-P17) mean is 83.6 units, indicating peak season.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are in peak summer for 'Jersey Basic Fitted T-shirts'. Demand remains robust with a recent mean (P14-P18) of 81 units and a standard deviation of approximately 13. The major operational challenge is the persistence of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total in-transit is reported as 683 units, but 326 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, and P10) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P14 (89 units) and P17 (268 units), totaling 357 units. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order quantity, it believes there is an excess of 326 units. To force the backend to place an order that covers true demand, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period coverage (L=2 + 1) at ~300 units (3 * 81 + z*sigma) and then ARTIFICIALLY inflate mu_hat to offset the 326-unit phantom inventory. Setting mu_hat to 626 ensures the backend logic (626 - 683 = negative, but with cap calculation) understands it needs to maintain high stock levels despite the faulty pipeline data. I will use 'explicit' sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Phantom pipeline inventory remains fixed at 326 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Functional pipeline is 357 units. Peak summer demand for basic t-shirts is sustained at ~81 units/period.

These orders are significantly past their lead time and will not arrive. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P14 (89) and P17 (268), totaling 357 units. These should have arrived in P19/P20, but with on-hand currently at 0, a stockout is occurring. To force the OR backend to order sufficient stock despite the 326 units of phantom inventory it 'sees' as coming soon, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. The target base stock (assuming L=2) for a high service level (95%) is approximately (1+L)*demand + safety_stock \u2248 (3*81) + 1.65*(sqrt(3)*12) \u2248 243 + 34 = 277 units. However, because the backend subtracts the pipeline (683 total, of which 326 is fake), it will see 683 units and place an order of 0 unless base_stock > 683. To trigger an order that covers (~81 units/period), I set mu_hat to 780. This ensures (mu_hat - phantom_pipeline) allows for current demand replenishment.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), we are in the peak summer demand season for t-shirts. Demand in Period 20 reached a high of 119 units. The mean demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 87.8 units, reflecting this seasonal peak. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 818 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Overdue orders from P1 (45), P3 (89), P4 (79), and P10 (113) total 326 units that will never arrive. Additionally, the order from P14 (89 units) is now 7 periods overdue and also highly likely lost. This brings the total 'phantom' inventory to 415 units. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (268), P20 (135), and potentially a very delayed P14 (though unlikely). Due to the OR backend's logic subtracting all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target inventory level, thereby bypassing the phantom stock hurdle and ensuring a new order is triggered to meet the high summer demand. I am setting the explicit mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) at a forecasted demand of ~90 units/period, plus an additional buffer to offset the 415 lost units: (90 * 3) + 415 = 685. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the high demand volatility and shipping uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 415 units as P14 (89 units) is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Peak summer demand confirmed with P20 demand at 119 units; recent 5-period mean is 87.8.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8), demand is at its summer peak, with June/July demand averaging over 100 units/period (P20: 119, P21: 122). On-hand inventory is 0, and the system is significantly constrained by pipeline contamination. The total recorded in-transit of 818 units is misleading due to 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. History shows confirmed lost orders from P1 (45), P3 (89), P4 (79), P10 (113), and now P14 (89), totaling 415 units. These 415 units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock calculation, leading to consistent under-ordering and stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a base demand of ~100 units/period (reflecting current summer peak) for a (L+1=3) period window, which equals 300 units. To bypass the 415 phantom units, I am inflating mu_hat to 715 (300 + 415). This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to trigger an order despite the faulty pipeline data. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead time variability observed (mean approx 1.6 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Phantom pipeline inventory total confirmed at 415 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Peak summer demand regime reaching >100 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), we are in the peak summer season for basic t-shirts. Demand remains high, with the last three periods recording 119, 122, and 81 units, yielding a 3-period mean of 107.3. Pipeline reconciliation is critical: the current In-transit of 683 units is heavily contaminated by 415 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14), which are now 7-22 periods overdue. Subtracting these phantom units leaves a functional pipeline of only 268 units (from Period 17). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit (683) from the base stock (calculated using mu_hat), it will under-order unless we explicitly inflate mu_hat. To ensure the backend places an order that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~107 units/period) while accounting for the 415-unit phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 736 (calculated as [Mean Demand 107.3 * 3 periods] + 415 phantom units). Setting L to 2 reflects the promised and recently observed lead time. This adjustment forces the backend to recognize the inventory gap and place the necessary orders to sustain peak season service levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 24 (July 22, 2019). The product is a fitted t-shirt during peak summer season. Current demand remains strong (P23 demand 92, recent mean ~95-100 units). Pipeline Analysis: Total In-transit is 751. However, 415 units are confirmed lost (P1: 45, P3: 89, P4: 79, P10: 113, P14: 89). Functional pipeline = 751 - 415 = 336 units (primarily from P17: 268 and P23: 68). The OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' to calculate orders. Since 415 units are 'phantom' stock, the backend will under-order. To fix this, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * anticipated_demand + phantom_stock. With L=2 (promised), anticipated_demand ~100 units/period, and phantom_stock = 415. mu_hat = (3 * 100) + 415 = 715. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for moderate volatility in summer demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (late July), we are in the peak summer demand regime for this t-shirt. Recent demand (P20-P24) averages 111.8 units/period with a peak of 145 last period. The 'phantom' pipeline inventory, consisting of lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14, currently totals 415 units (45+89+79+113+89). These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (757) but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places any order at all, mu_hat must be set to a value that offsets this 415-unit distortion. The target inventory level to cover 3 periods (L+1) at ~115 units/period is ~345 units. Calculating the functional pipeline (In-transit 757 - Phantom 415 = 342), we are currently nearly balanced but facing a stockout. To bypass the backend logic and force replenishment for the high late-summer demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom gap plus the upcoming demand needs. L is set to calculated as recent shipments have stabilized at 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Phantom pipeline inventory total stabilized at 415 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Peak summer demand regime (July) average is approximately 112 units/period, requiring significant mu_hat inflation to bypass lost-order data contamination.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand period (early August). Recent demand (P21-P25) has averaged 113.8 units per period, significantly higher than earlier in the spring. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total in-transit is reported as 833 units, but 415 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P17 (268), P23 (68), P24 (6), and P25 (76), totaling 418 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 833 units from the base stock calculation, it will fail to place sufficient orders. To compensate, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Base Stock = (L+1)*mu + z*sigma. For L=2, mu=114, z~1.75, and sigma~25, the target base stock is ~500. To force an order when the backend sees 833 in-transit, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that, when multiplied by (1+L), exceeds the phantom inventory and covers upcoming demand. I am setting mu_hat = 450 (which corresponds to (1+L)*150) to ensure the backend continues to replenish stock despite the pipeline contamination.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak summer demand period (mid-August) for basic t-shirts. Demand remains high, with the last 5 periods (P22-P26) averaging approximately 108.8 units/period. The primary management challenge is the significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory: orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14 (totaling 415 units) are confirmed lost, as they are between 7 and 25 periods overdue. The OR backend's order logic subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the target base stock. To prevent under-ordering due to this 415-unit distortion, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window (L=2 promised) using a mean of 110 units and adding a safety buffer for high volatility (std ~20). Target = 110 * 3 + 1.645 * 20 * sqrt(3) \u2248 387. To this target, I add the 415 lost units to 'bridge' the gap in the backend logic, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 802. This ensures the backend emits an order that covers real demand despite the contaminated pipeline data.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-19. We are in the late summer season for item 678342002 (Jersey Basic T-shirt). Demand has been volatile but generally high (average ~100 units/period over the last 5-6 weeks). The primary challenge is a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline tracking system. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14 (totaling 415 units) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they still appear in 'in-transit' (currently 803 units). The OR backend uses 'on-hand + in-transit' to calculate orders; therefore, it overestimates available stock by 415 units. To compensate and ensure we maintain enough stock for (L+1) periods (approx 300 units), I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat'. I set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~100 units/period multiplied by (1+L), and then add the 415 lost units to bypass the backend's inventory deduction. Total mu_hat = (3 * 100) + 415 = 715. Sigma is set high to reflect seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom pipeline inventory remains 415 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14). Demand in August shows a slight softening (47 last period) but recent month mean remains ~100. Effective pipeline (excluding phantom) is 388 units (orders from P17, P24, P27).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (Aug 26), we are managing a seasonal t-shirt product. Demand has softened slightly in late August (last two signals: 47 and 86), but the overall peak season mean remains high. A critical operational challenge is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total in-transit is 803 units, however, 415 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14) are confirmed lost/overdue by more than 4 periods and will not arrive. This leaves an effective functional pipeline of 388 units (orders from P17, P24, P27). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 415 ghost units, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for (L+1=3) periods should cover roughly 270-300 units (based on a 90-100 unit/period forecast). By setting mu_hat explicitly to 550, I counteract the 415-unit phantom inventory, effectively instructing the backend to aim for a sufficient on-hand position for upcoming weeks as we transition out of summer.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), we are entering the post-summer season for a standard t-shirt SKU. Recent demand has shown high volatility and a cooling from the July peak (approx. 112 units/period) to a current mean of approximately 80 units/period (P25-P29 mean: 87.2). The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 415 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) which the OR backend incorrectly assumes is available stock. The total reported In-transit is 803, but the functional pipeline is only 388 units (orders from P24, P27, and any subsequent recent orders). To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to be greater than the functional pipeline plus a safety buffer, while offsetting the 415 phantom units. mu_hat is set to (Current Demand ~80) * (L+1) + Phantom Inventory. Since L=2, (80 * 3) + 415 = 655. This will signal the backend that the current inventory position (including the false 415 units) is insufficient to cover the demand lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Autumn transition detected; mean demand stabilized at ~80 units/period after summer peak. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 415 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9), we are transitioning from the summer peak into the autumn season for this SKU (Fitted T-shirt). Recent demand (P27-P30) has stabilized at approximately 64 units/period (47, 86, 76, 47), which is lower than the July/August peak of ~112. The most critical issue is the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The In-transit figure of 689 units includes 415 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14), leaving a functional pipeline of 274 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 689 from its base stock calculation, it will severely under-order. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock sufficient to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the current autumn rate (~65 units * 3 = 195) plus an inflation factor of 415 to negate the phantom units. Corrected mu_hat target = 195 + 415 = 610. I use 'calculate' for lead time to capture recent variations (L=3 for P30 and P26) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime has transitioned from summer peak (>100) to autumn stable (~65 units/period). Phantom pipeline inventory remains 415 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation of approximately 415 units to override OR backend logic.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16), the demand for the fitted T-shirt has stabilized into an autumn regime. The recent 5-period mean (P27-P31) is 60.0 units/period, down from the summer peak which exceeded 100 units. The critical operational challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Historically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P14 (totaling 415 units) are confirmed lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total of 689 units. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from its base stock calculation; if we don't adjust, it will see 689 units and refuse to order, despite only ~274 units (689 - 415) being actual viable stock. To override this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a value that covers the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) PLUS the 415 lost units. At a forecast of 60 units/period, the target base stock should be ~180 units. Adding 415 units to offset the phantom inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 595. Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized autumn volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (late September), demand for this fitted T-shirt has notably decelerated from the summer peak (>100 units) to an autumn average of ~40 units over the last three periods (47, 44, 28). The system shows 689 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms 415 of these are 'phantom' units from lost orders (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14). Specifically, the Period 17 order (268 units) is now 16 periods overdue and must be considered lost, increasing the total phantom inventory to 683 units (415 + 268). Effectively, the 'functional' pipeline is nearly zero, and there is no on-hand inventory. To trigger the OR backend to order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 683 phantom units while reflecting the new lower demand regime. I estimate current demand (L+1=3) at ~120 units (40/period * 3). Adding the 683 phantom units to this target results in a mu_hat of ~803.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 683 units as the Period 17 order (268 units) is 16 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Autumn demand regime confirmed at ~40 units/period (P30-P32 mean: 39.7) down from summer peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 34 (late September). Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (>100 units/period) to an autumn regime of approximately 40 units/period. The mean demand for P30-P33 is 40.5. The 'In-transit' figure of 872 units is severely contaminated by 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are confirmed lost but remain on the books. This phantom inventory includes P1 (45), P3 (89), P4 (79), P10 (113), P14 (89), and now P17 (268), totaling 683 units. The functional pipeline consists only of the order placed in P33 (183 units) and potentially the small order from P24 (6 units, though likely lost). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 872 units as available stock and refusing to order, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 should cover 3 periods of demand (~120 units). To achieve this while the backend subtracts 872 units of pipeline, I set mu_hat to 1000. This ensures the backend calculates a requirement higher than the phantom inventory and places an appropriate order to maintain stock for the autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Phantom pipeline inventory remains the primary driver of ordering distortion. Total confirmed lost units: 683 (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Autumn demand regime stable at ~40 units/period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. Demand has transitioned into an autumn regime, with the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) showing mean demand of 42.8 units per period, a significant drop from the summer peak (>100). The primary operational challenge is 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total confirmed lost shipments are 683 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' as pipeline inventory to determine order size: Order = BaseStock - (On-Hand + In-Transit). Because the 683 lost units remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, the backend will severely under-order or order 0 unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset this delta. I will set mu_hat to (Expected Demand * (1+L)) + Phantom units. Recent demand mean is ~43, promised L=2. Calculation: (43 * 3) + 683 = 812. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 683-unit phantom stock.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the inventory situation is critical due to massive pipeline contamination. The 'In-transit' figure of 1050 units includes 683 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). The functional pipeline is only 367 units (orders from P33 and P34), which are still within their expected lead time window (L=2). Demand has stabilized into an autumn regime, with the most recent 5-period mean (P31-P35) being approximately 40.8 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 683 'phantom' units it incorrectly sees as upcoming supply, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I will set mu_hat based on the actual demand forecast of ~40 units across the (L+1) horizon plus an offset of 683 units to neutralize the lost shipments. Thus, mu_hat = (40 * 3) + 683 \u2248 803. Sigma_hat is set based on recent autumn volatility (std \u2248 10). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Functional pipeline is 367 units (P33, P34). Phantom inventory remains 683 units. Autumn demand regime (Oct) confirmed at ~40 units/period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), we are in a stable autumn demand regime estimated at approximately 40 units per period. The primary operational challenge remains the calculation of base stock due to 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. The current In-transit total is 867 units. Based on historical tracking, 683 units are confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 14, and 17). Additionally, the order from Period 34 (178 units) has not yet arrived but is still within a reasonable window (3 periods). The functional pipeline is therefore approximately 184 units (201 total units minus potential delays). However, the OR backend sees 867 units as available stock. To force an order and maintain service levels, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset this 683-unit discrepancy. The target base stock for a 2-period lead time (covering 3 periods of demand) at ~40 units/period should be approximately 120-150 units. To achieve this while the backend thinks we have 867 in transit, mu_hat is set to 850 units. On-hand is 156, which covers current demand, so the goal is to trigger a small replenishment or stabilize the pipeline once Period 34 arrives.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. We are in the autumn demand regime for this t-shirt SKU, which has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the summer peak. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is approximately 37.4 units/period (33, 27, 32, and the previous 43, 52). Current on-hand inventory is 124. The 'In-transit' figure of 867 is severely contaminated by 683 units of 'phantom' inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P17). The functional pipeline consists of the Period 34 order (178 units) and the Period 6 order (6 units, though likely negligible/noise). Thus, functional pipeline is ~184 units. Total functional position (On-hand 124 + Functional Pipeline 184) = 308 units. With the current demand regime at ~40 units, this provides ~7 periods of cover, which is ample. However, to prevent the OR backend from seeing the 683 phantom units as available stock and refusing to order in the future, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat based on the current regime (~40) plus a cushion to offset the phantom units, while allowing the current high on-hand/pipeline to naturally deplete.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the SKU is in a stable autumn demand phase. Recent demand (P30-P38) averages 41.2 units per period, a significant decrease from the summer peak. The primary challenge remains 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Currently, In-transit shows 867 units. However, based on history, 683 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 184 units (specifically the P34 order of 178 units plus minor residuals). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this phantom 683-unit inflation, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 807 (calculated as (1+L)*demand + phantom_offset = 3*41.3 + 683) to override the base stock calculation. Sigma_hat is set to 24 (sqrt(3)*14) based on recent volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand has stabilized into an autumn/winter regime, much lower than the summer peak. The last 4 periods (P36-P39) show demand values of 27, 32, 42, and 36, averaging approx 34 units/period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total In-transit is 867 units. Based on historical tracking, 683 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Additionally, the order from P34 (178 units) is now 6 periods overdue (ordered Sept 30, expected mid-Oct, now mid-Nov), which strongly suggests it is also lost. Total phantom inventory is now 861 units (683 + 178). This leaves a functional pipeline of effectively 6 units (from P24, also likely lost) or 0 units. To bypass the OR backend logic which sees 867 units in transit and thus refuses to order, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. I will aim for a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~35 * 3 = 105) plus the phantom inventory (861), totaling 966. Setting mu_hat to 960 will trigger a replenishment order to restore on-hand inventory, which is currently 46 and depleting.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 861 units as the Period 34 order (178 units) is 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Functional pipeline is effectively zero. Autumn demand regime remains stable at ~35 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the product enters the late autumn/early winter season. Historical demand from the same period last year (if available) or the recent trend shows demand has stabilized to a lower volume than the summer peak. The current demand regime (P36-P40) mean is 29.4 units/period, significantly lower than the P20-P25 peak. Inventory reconciliation is the primary challenge: the 'In-transit' figure of 930 is heavily contaminated by 861 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and now P34). Only the P40 order of 63 units is considered a functional part of the pipeline. Since the base inventory logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see 930 units and refuse to order, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * forecast + phantom_units. With L=2 and forecast=30, mu_hat = (3 * 30) + 861 = 951. This forces the OR engine to recognize the need for stock despite the fake pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Phantom pipeline inventory remains the critical factor. Re-confirmed lost units: P1(45), P3(89), P4(79), P10(113), P14(89), P17(268), P34(178). Cumulative phantom inventory = 861 units. Functional pipeline is 63 units (P40 order). Demand stabilized at ~30 units/period for the late autumn/winter regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-25. The demand regime for this SKU (Fitted T-shirt) has transitioned from its summer peak (>100 units/period) to a stable winter baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has been 32, 42, 36, 10, 18, averaging 27.6 units/period. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The total 'In-transit' reflects 950 units, but 861 of these units are confirmed lost from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P34 (all significantly past lead time). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from P40 (63 units) and P41 (20 units). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 950 units as available inventory and refusing to order, mu_hat must be explicitly set to (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_inventory. Using L=2 and mean_demand=28, mu_hat = (3 * 28) + 861 = 945. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the lost units while maintaining a service level for the actual demand of ~28 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the SKU is in a stable late-autumn/winter demand regime with an average demand of approximately 25-30 units per period (P38-P42 mean ~28). The critical challenge remains 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Total In-transit is 965 units, but 861 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from P40 (63 units), P41 (20 units), and P42 (15 units), totaling 98 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 861 lost units as available stock and thus suppressing new orders, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Specifically, the backend logic 'base_stock - pipeline' requires mu_hat to be increased by the volume of phantom inventory. With L=2, the base stock targets (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I will set mu_hat to (3 periods * 30 units/period) + 861 units = 951 units. Sigma_hat is set to a standard volatility for this regime (sqrt(3)*10).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom pipeline inventory remains 861 units. Functional pipeline is 98 units. Current demand regime (Nov-Dec) stabilized at ~25-30 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are in a low-demand late autumn/winter regime for the jersey t-shirt. Recent demand (P40-P43) has consistently averaged ~19 units. The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline'\u2014cumulative lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, and P34 totaling 861 units. These units appear as 'in-transit' to the OR engine but will never arrive. To counteract this and trigger new orders, mu_hat must be set to a value greater than (On-hand + Functional Pipeline + Phantom Pipeline). Current on-hand is 69. Functional pipeline includes orders from P42 (15 units) and P43 (15 units). Total physical stock/expected arrivals = 99 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the total observed 'in-transit' (897 units) from its base stock calculation, mu_hat must be inflated significantly to prevent an ordering freeze. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order that maintains a safety stock of roughly 3 periods of demand (~60-75 units) on top of the phantom distortion.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its final periods (P45 of 47). Current demand is in a low-winter regime (avg ~15 units/period). Historical 'In-transit' data (940 units) is heavily contaminated by 861 'phantom' units from lost historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34). The functional pipeline consists only of P42 (15), P43 (15), and P44 (43), totaling 73 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 861 phantom units being perceived as available stock, mu_hat must be explicitly set to (functional demand coverage) + (phantom inventory offset). I target covering two periods of demand (~30 units) plus the 861 offset, totaling 891. Sigma_hat is kept low (explicitly) to reflect the low volatility in this stable winter regime and minimize unnecessary holding cost as the game concludes.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in a low-demand winter regime. Recent demand (P40-P45) averages ~17.5 units/period. The on-hand inventory is 69 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 910 is heavily contaminated by 861 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34). The functional pipeline is only 49 units (P44 order). To prevent the OR backend from erroneously halting orders due to the 861-unit phantom surplus, I must explicitly set mu_hat to include this amount. Base stock calculation: Target Stock = (L+1)*Expected_Demand + Safety_Stock. Projected (2+1)*18 = 54. Adding the 861-unit phantom buffer to bypass the pipeline deduction logic, I set mu_hat to 920. This ensures the backend sees a need for current demand coverage despite the false 'In-transit' data. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to allow for standard holiday demand variation.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47 (Dec 30), we are in a low-demand winter regime. Recent demand (P42-P46) has averaged ~16.6 units/period, significantly lower than the summer peak. The 'In-transit' figure of 910 is severely contaminated by 'phantom' inventory from lost orders. Re-evaluating the history: lost orders include P1(45), P3(89), P4(79), P10(113), P14(89), P17(268), and P34(178). Total phantom inventory = 861 units. Actual functional in-transit is 910 - 861 = 49 units (from P44). On-hand inventory is 63. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 910 units as available and thus suppressing orders, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2-3 periods with a mean demand of ~17 and low variance should be around 60-70 units. By setting mu_hat to 950, I force the backend to see (950 - 910) = 40 units as the 'gap', which combined with on-hand 63 will likely lead to a zero or very small order, appropriate for the current stock level and low demand.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Dec) confirmed at mean ~17 units/period. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 861 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17, P34).
