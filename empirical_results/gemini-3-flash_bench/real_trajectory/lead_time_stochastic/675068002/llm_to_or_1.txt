Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 675068002, a women's cotton blouse. Historical demand shows a slight upward trend (41, 41, 41, 47, 51 over the last five weeks), with the most recent observation being 51. Given the product category and the date (mid-February), we are entering the spring season, where demand for airy cotton blouses typically increases. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. I will prioritize the most recent data (the last 5 samples) to reflect the recent growth in demand while preparing for the (L+1) exposure period (3 periods). I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this recent regime, and 'default' for lead time for now.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we observed a demand spike of 158 units, which is significantly higher than the 5 historical samples (mean ~44). This suggests a strong regime shift or seasonal trend for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse as we move into mid-February. My inventory is currently 0 with 52 units in transit (ordered P1, promised lead time 2). Since I start with 0 on-hand and missed all demand (158 units) in P1, I need to react quickly to the new demand level. I will use the last 6 samples (5 historical + P1) to calculate a more representative mean, but recognize that P1's 158 heavily weights the average. The mean of {41, 41, 41, 47, 51, 158} is ~63. However, given the possible continued high demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the upward trend {47, 51, 158}, giving a mean of 85.3. Pipeline coverage (L+1) = 3 periods. 3 * 85.3 = 256. With 52 in transit, the OR backend will order around 204 units (subject to the cap), which balances the risk of stockouts against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 1 (158 units vs historical avg ~44); potentially entering a high-demand seasonal regime for Spring/Everyday Collection garments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 675068002 (Womens Everyday Collection Blouse) has entered a massive demand surge starting in mid-February, far exceeding the initial historical average of ~44 units/week. Period 1 demand was 158 and Period 2 was 392. This likely reflects the launch of the Spring collection. Inventory is currently critical (0 on-hand) with total stockouts occurring. Orders from Period 1 (52 units) and Period 2 (189 units) are still in transit. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in Period 4), and the Period 2 order during Period 4 (visible in Period 5). To address the massive demand increase and stockout risk, I am forecasting an explicit mu_hat based on the average of the last two high-demand periods (approx 275 units/week) multiplied by (1+L) = 3 periods, totaling 825. Sigma_hat is set explicitly high to handle the extreme volatility observed. L remains 'default' (2 periods) as there is not yet enough evidence that the supply chain is failing beyond the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 1 & 2 demand (avg 275) is ~6x historical avg, aligned with Spring collection launch.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 4 (2019/3/4). The 'Everyday Collection' blouse is experiencing a massive seasonal demand surge. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was ~44/week, but since early February (P1-P3), demand has jumped to 158, 392, and 359 respectively. The average demand over the last three periods is 303 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 754 units in transit. According to lead time rules, the order from P1 (52 units) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message, but it is not. This suggests either a lead time longer than 2 periods or a lost/delayed shipment. However, following the 'Critical Timing Example', an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3 and is visible in the P4 start message (P3 conclude). The P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', which confirms the P1 order (L=2) is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3. I will set L to 3 to account for this. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the recent regime (last 3 periods) which averages 303 units per week. For sigma_hat, I'll use the deviation within this new high-demand regime to handle the volatility seen in the 158-392 swing.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for SKU 675068002 exceeds promised 2 periods: P1 order (L=2 promised) did not arrive by P3 conclude message. Actual lead time estimated at 3+ periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019-03-11), we see the 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse continues to have high demand (Period 4 demand: 263). History shows a clear regime shift starting Period 1, with recent demand averaging ~293 units (P1-P4: 158, 392, 359, 263). The Period 1 order (52 units) is still missing (overdue), but the Period 2 order (189 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), suggesting the logistics are functional but perhaps inconsistent or prone to early-season losses. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 1,077 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4 orders). To ensure coverage for the L+1 window (3 periods) and account for the high demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the 4-period recent window (avg ~293 * 3 = 879) and increasing sigma_hat to handle the high variance observed during this launch phase. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time of 2 while staying alert to the missing P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Transition to high-demand regime confirmed for Spring Everyday Collection (P1-P4 avg: 293 units). Shipment from Period 1 (52 units) remains missing after 4 periods, while Period 2 shipment arrived on time (L=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Straight-cut shirt' from the 'Womens Everyday Collection', which explains the heavy demand surge starting in mid-February (Spring collection launch). Current period is March 18, 2019. Observed demand (P1-P5) has averaged 272.8 units per period, far exceeding the pre-February historical average (~44). Stockouts have been persistent (on-hand 0 for 4 of 5 periods). Regarding lead times: the P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2), but the P1 order (52 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. The system shows 1,077 units in transit (P3: 513, P4: 512, P1: 52). To account for the 'lost' P1 order and the consistent high demand, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the variability and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 (to capture the active Spring regime while smoothing the volatility between 392 and 192). This will force the OR engine to target a base stock sufficient for the current high-demand cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 shipment (52 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed vs promised L=2). Spring demand regime remains sustained (P1-P5 mean: 273), but showing high variance (std ~95).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime for the Women's Everyday Collection (Spring season). The average demand from Period 1 to Period 6 is approximately 257 units (158, 392, 359, 263, 192, 179), which is significantly higher than the 2019 baseline (~44). The Period 1 order (52 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 3 order of 513 units (ordered Feb 25 with L=2) was expected to arrive in Period 5 or 6, but has not concluded yet. If it arrives in Period 7, the actual lead time would be 4 periods. The Period 4 order (512 units) is also in transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0, putting us in a stockout state despite massive pipeline inventory (1077 units). I am setting L to 4 to reflect the observed delays and using recent_N=6 to capture the spring demand regime's mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the extended lead time and high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for SKU 675068002 is experiencing significant instability: while P2 arrived in 2 periods, P3 (513 units) is overdue by 2 periods (L effectively 4+).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), SKU 675068002 (Womens Everyday Collection shirt) is in a high-demand spring regime (P1-P7 average demand: 260.5). However, significant supply chain disruptions are evident. The order from P1 (52 units) is lost. The order from P3 (513 units) is now 2 periods overdue (5 periods since order, vs promised L=2). The order from P4 (512 units) is also overdue. The only successful arrival was P2 (L=2). This indicates an unreliable supply chain where actual lead time for successful deliveries is either 2 or significantly longer/lost. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 1472 units in-transit (P3, P4, P7). To mitigate stockouts caused by these delays, I am setting L to 4 (explicit) to reflect the current delay of the P3/P4 orders. I'm using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the spring collection demand levels (~260/week), and sigma_hat is set to the recent std (~100/week) to handle the high variance. This forces the base stock calculation to account for longer lead times and higher safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability confirmed: P3 order (513 units) delayed beyond 4 periods (L=5+ if it arrives); P1 order (52 units) confirmed lost. Effective lead time for planning increased to 4+ periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/4/8), the demand for this 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse remains high. The recent demand (Periods 4-8) averages ~255 units per period. The supply chain has been extremely erratic: Period 1's order is lost, Period 2 arrived on time (L=2), Period 3 (513 units) is severely overdue (now 6 periods since ordering, likely lost), and Period 7 arrived early (L=1). Currently, 36 units are on-hand. The pipeline inventory (1079 units) includes the likely lost P3 order (513 units). If we exclude P3, the active pipeline is 566 units (P4 order of 512, P8 order of 2, and P9 order which we are deciding now). Given 'arrived=189 (L=2)' and 'arrived=395 (L=1)', the promised L=2 is a reasonable average for calculations, but the high failure rate (lost shipments) suggests we must keep safety stocks high. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current spring regime (avg ~255) and default lead time of 2, allowing the OR engine to buffer for the high variance (std ~75 in recent periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Supply chain remains highly unreliable; Period 3 order (513 units) is now 6 periods overdue and categorized as lost along with Period 1. Active supply chain planning should discount these 'zombie' units in the pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), the 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse continues in its high-demand Spring season. Analysis of the game history confirms that shipments are extremely unreliable: Period 1 (52 units) and Period 3 (513 units) are now 9 and 7 periods overdue respectively, and are effectively lost (zombie inventory). However, Period 7 arrived in just 1 period. These massive disruptions create a falsely inflated 'In-transit' figure (~1079 units), of which 565 units (P1 + P3) are unlikely to arrive. The actual valid pipeline is roughly 514 units (P4: 512, P8: 2). To compensate for the 'zombie' units blocking new orders via the OR engine's capped base-stock logic, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock level and force more ordering, while setting mu_hat based on the recent 9-period regime (Avg ~277/period). I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the high-demand volatility (mean 277, std ~85) observed since the Spring shift in Period 1.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination: 565 units (from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost/zombie shipments that remain in 'In-transit' but will not satisfy demand. Subsequent arrivals (P2, P7) proves the supply chain is functional but erratic.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), the product is in a sustained high-demand regime for the Women's Everyday Collection (Spring season). Demand from Periods 1-10 shows a mean of approximately 257 units per week. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable: 565 units (from P1 and P3 orders) are confirmed lost/zombie shipments that never arrived. The 'In-transit' figure of 1211 units is heavily contaminated by these zombies and the large P4 order (512 units) which is now 7 periods old (L=6+ overdue) and likely lost. The only reliable recent arrival was from Period 8. To compensate for these 'pipeline ghosts' and the high risk of stockouts (on-hand is 0), I am setting L explicitly to 3 to reflect the effective lead time including delays. mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current high-demand Spring regime (avg ~257/period), while sigma_hat is set to explicit=110 to account for high demand volatility (std ~90) and shipment uncertainty. This will force the OR engine to place a larger replenishment order to overcome the inflated (but non-existent) pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination reached critical levels: ~1077 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed or highly likely lost shipments, rendering the 'In-transit' metric misleading for stock calculations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), the SKU (Womens Everyday Collection Blouse) is in its peak Spring demand regime. Demand since Period 1 has averaged 248 units (Std: 85), significantly higher than the pre-Feb baseline (~44). The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 1 (52 units), Period 3 (513 units), and Period 4 (512 units) are significantly overdue (11, 9, and 8 periods respectively) and must be treated as lost. These total 1077 'zombie' units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1211 is misleading as only 134 units (ordered Period 10) are realistically expected to arrive. Effective lead time is erratic: while P7 arrived in 1 period and P8 in 2, the high loss rate necessitates a conservative planning horizon. To ensure the OR backend ignores the zombie pipeline and orders sufficient stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for L (set to 4 to account for volatility) and mu_hat (set to cover L+1 periods of current demand). Mu_hat is calculated as (4+1) * 250 units \u2248 1250 units. This allows the OR engine to place an order that overcomes the 1077-unit 'ghost' pipeline deficit.

Carry-over insight: Current functional pipeline is only 134 units (Period 10 order); all 1077 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost/zombie shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 675068002 is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, the supply chain has been highly unreliable: shipments from Period 1 (52), Period 3 (513), and Period 4 (512) are confirmed lost/zombie units, totaling 1077 units that pollute the 'In-transit' metric of 1416. The only valid pipeline units are from Period 10 (134) and Period 12 (205). The Period 10 shipment should have arrived by now (L=2 promised), but its absence in the Period 12 conclude message suggests a lead time of at least 3 periods or another potential loss. Demand remains in the Spring regime but has moderated recently (P12 demand was 111). To compensate for the 1077 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as pipeline inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using a recent mean (approx 150 units for periods 10-12) and a lead time of 3 (L+1=4 periods). Targeted base stock = 150 * 4 = 600. To offset the 1077 'phantom' units, I set mu_hat to 600 + 1077 = 1677. This forces the OR engine to place an order despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is set to 3 to reflect the observed delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline contamination confirmed at 1077 units (P1, P3, P4 orders). Periodic lead time observed as 3+ periods for recent orders (P10 overdue). Planning must explicitly adjust mu_hat upward to offset 'zombie' in-transit units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 675068002 is currently facing massive pipeline contamination. As of Period 14, the 'In-transit' metric shows 1837 units, but historical analysis confirms at least 1077 units are lost (Orders from P1, P3, and P4). Additionally, the order from P10 (134 units) is now 4 periods old (L=3+), making it highly likely lost given the erratic but generally shorter lead times seen in P7-P8. Currently, only the orders from P12 (205 units) and P13 (421 units) can be considered potentially valid. Demand has cooled significantly from the Spring peak (~300) to a more moderate level (avg of last 3 periods: 116 units). To compensate for the 'zombie' units in the pipeline that the OR engine will wrongly subtract from its order calculation, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' high value. This value is calculated to force an order that covers (~115 units/period) * (L+1 periods) while overcoming the ~1200+ units of fake pipeline inventory. I will use L=3 for planning to reflect the recent slowdown in delivery confirmed by P10's non-arrival.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination increased to ~1211 units (P1, P3, P4, and P10 orders confirmed or likely lost). Effective demand regime has shifted down from Spring peak (avg 293) to a stabilized late-Spring level (avg ~116 over P11-P13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for this Womens Everyday Collection blouse has stabilized at a lower level compared to the Spring peak (recent 4-period mean ~109 units). There is severe pipeline contamination: 1157 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are significantly past their promised lead time (2) and even observed maximum lead time (2). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, but 1157 of the 1685 'In-transit' units are 'zombies'. To compensate for the backend subtracting these nonexistent units from the base stock, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to incorporate both a 3-period demand forecast and a buffer equal to the lost units. I set L to 3 to reflect recent instability, though P12 arrived in 2 periods. Mu_hat calculation: ((L+1) * mean_recent_demand) + lost_units = (4 * 109) + 1157 = 1593.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination breakdown: P1 (52), P3 (513), P4 (512), P10 (134) are confirmed lost/zombie shipments totaling 1211 units. This renders the standard 'In-transit' inventory metric misleading for automated logic.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/05/27 (Period 16). The product is a women's shirt from the Everyday Collection. Demand has transitioned from a high Spring peak (avg ~293 in Feb/Mar) to a lower, stabilized late-Spring regime (avg ~107 over P11-P15). The biggest challenge is 'pipeline contamination'. The system shows 1685 units in-transit, but historical evidence confirms that orders from P1 (52), P3 (513), P4 (512), and now explicitly P10 (134) are lost/zombie shipments, totaling 1211 units. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 474 units (P13: 421, P14: 53). Order P12 (205 units) arrived on time in P14 (L=2). To compensate for the 1211 'ghost' units in the pipeline calculation (which the OR backend subtracts from the base stock), I must inflate mu_hat. I will set a new demand regime (recent_N, N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~107 units/period, but use the 'explicit' method to add the lost units into the base stock calculation: Expected Target = [(1+L) * Mean Demand] + Lost Units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 107) + 1211 = 1532. This ensures the backend places an order that ignores the dead inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed pipeline contamination increased to 1211 units (P1, P3, P4, P10 orders). Late-Spring demand regime stabilized at ~107 units/period (P11-P15 range: 79-160).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' straight-cut shirt has stabilized into a post-Spring regime. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 90.8 units (111, 79, 87, 106, 71). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with significant 'zombie' pipeline inventory. Analysis of the history shows that shipments from Period 1 (52), Period 3 (513), Period 4 (512), Period 10 (134), and Period 13 (421) are likely lost as they have exceeded the promised lead time (L=2) by a wide margin (P13 is now 4 periods old). Total confirmed lost/zombie units = 1632. The 'In-transit' metric of 1685 includes these units plus a recent small order from P14 (53 units). Effective functional pipeline is near zero. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 1685 units in-transit, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) periods of demand (where L=2) as 3 * 91 = 273. However, since the internal logic subtracts the full 1685 pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 1632 lost units. Required mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + (Zombie Pipeline). Target Base Stock = 273 units + buffer (~100) = 373. 373 + 1632 = 2005. This high mu_hat ensures the OR backend issues a replenishment order to cover actual pending demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination updated: P1(52), P3(513), P4(512), P10(134), and P13(421) are confirmed lost/zombie shipments totaling 1632 units. Late-Spring demand regime (P12-P16) mean is 91 units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We are in a late-Spring/early-Summer phase where demand has significantly cooled from the Spring peak (~293 avg) to a more stable regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 77.8 units, while the mean for the last 3 periods (P15-P17) is 74.3 units. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this cooling trend. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' metric of 2031 units is heavily contaminated by lost shipments (zombie units). Specifically, orders from P1 (52), P3 (513), P4 (512), P10 (134), and P13 (421) are almost certainly lost given they are far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods. Total lost units = 1632. This leaves a 'functional' pipeline of 399 units (P14: 53, P17: 346). Historically, actual lead times for successful deliveries have been 1-2 periods. I set L=2 (default) and mu_hat to be explicit. To calculate mu_hat, I aim to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 3 * 80 = 240) while neutralizing the effect of the 1632 'zombie' units. The OR engine calculates: Order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). By setting mu_hat = (functional_demand_coverage) + zombie_units, I ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order that ignores the lost inventory. 240 + 1632 = 1872.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination re-calculated: P1(52), P3(513), P4(512), P10(134), and P13(421) are confirmed lost/zombie shipments totaling 1632 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower Summer plateau; avg demand P13-P17 is ~78 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 19 (mid-June). The demand has clearly cooled from the Spring peak (~293 units) to a Summer trough. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 70.6 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P16-P18) average only 53.3 units. The pipeline situation is still critical: 2031 units are 'In-transit', but the vast majority are 'zombie' shipments. Specifically, P1(52), P3(513), P4(512), P10(134), and P13(421) are confirmed lost/overdue by at least 5 periods, totaling 1632 unusable units. Only the orders from P14(53) and P17(346) are realistically expected to arrive, though P14 is now overdue (L=5). To compensate for the 1632 'zombie' units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its inventory position calculation, I must artificially inflate the base stock by setting mu_hat significantly higher. I will target a functional coverage for the current regime (approx 55 units/period) while adding the 1632 units back. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L) * target_mean + zombie_units = (3 * 55) + 1632 = 1797. This forces the engine to ignore the 1632 units in the pipeline and order based on actual needs.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination breakdown verified: 1632 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) are non-recoverable zombie shipments. Seasonal demand has shifted to Summer plateau: P16-P18 mean is 53.3 units/period (-50% vs late-Spring avg).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' straight-cut shirt has settled into a Summer plateau (mean of P17-P19 is 54.3 units). The 'In-transit' metric of 2031 units is significantly contaminated. Based on history, orders from P1 (52), P3 (513), P4 (512), P10 (134), and P13 (421) are confirmed lost/zombie shipments, totaling 1632 units. Subtracting these from the current 2031 'In-transit' units leaves 399 units in the functional pipeline (matching the sum of orders from P14=53 and P17=346). These 399 units should be sufficient to cover demand for the next few periods given the current lower regime. To force the OR backend to place a small safety order and account for the pipeline contamination, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L) * anticipated_demand + contamination_offset. With L=2 (promised) and current demand around 54, the required base stock is approx 162. However, the OR backend sees 2031 in-transit and won't order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the 1632 zombie units. I will set mu_hat to 1800 to ensure the backend recognizes a need for replenishment while accounting for the invisible loss, targeting a functional base stock that accommodates the current Summer demand (approx 55-60/period) and recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination re-verified: 1632 units from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 are non-recoverable zombie shipments. Functional pipeline as of P20 is 399 units. Summer demand regime confirmed (avg ~54/period).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a Summer regime with a mean of approximately 58.5 units/period over the last 4 periods (P17-P20). The pipeline remains severely contaminated by 1,632 'zombie' units from older, lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' of 2,031 leaves a functional pipeline of 399 units (ordered in P17). Since the functional pipeline (399) far exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (approx. 58.5 * 3 = 175.5 units), the supply is sufficient. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that considers the Summer demand level plus a buffer to ensure no new orders are triggered while waiting for the P17 shipment (346 units), which is scheduled to arrive soon based on a 3-period lead time observation.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (July) appears stable at approximately 58 units/period, down significantly from the Spring peak. The functional pipeline is 399 units; zombie shipments remain at 1,632 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8), the item (Womens Everyday Blouse) has transitioned from the high-demand Spring regime to a stable Summer plateau. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 58.4 units per period (46, 43, 74, 59, 70). The 'In-transit' metric of 2031 units is significantly compromised by historical 'zombie' shipments from Periods 1 (52), 3 (513), 4 (512), 10 (134), and 13 (421), totaling 1,632 units. These orders are long overdue (promised L=2) and confirmed lost. The functional pipeline consists only of the Period 17 order (346 units), which is now overdue by 2 periods (L=5 effective if it arrives next). Subtracting the 1,632 lost units from the 2,031 total in-transit leaves 399 units of valid stock. However, since the OR backend uses the full in-transit figure (2031) in its base-stock calculation [order = base_stock - pipeline], I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 1,632 ghost units. Setting L=3 reflects the current reality of delayed arrivals. Planning for a 4-period window (L+1) at ~59 units/period requires ~236 units; adding the 1,632 offset, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1,868 to trigger a small replenishment or stabilize based on current functional stock.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed stable at ~59 units/period (P17-P21 avg 58.4). Functional pipeline is 399 units; zombie/lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) remain at 1,632 units.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019, middle of the Summer season. Demand has stabilized into a Summer plateau, with the last 6 periods (P17-P22) showing an average demand of 57.5 units/period (46, 43, 74, 59, 70, 53). There is massive pipeline contamination: 1,632 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) are confirmed 'zombie' shipments that are lost and will not arrive. Subtracting these from the total In-transit of 2,031 units leaves a functional pipeline of 399 units (the order from P17). This functional shipment (346 units ordered in P17) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived; while recent lead times have been erratic, this suggests a high probability that P17 is also lost or extremely delayed. However, to avoid over-ordering before confirming P17 is lost, I will continue to treat it as functional pipeline. Since functional pipeline (399) covers roughly 7 periods of Summer demand (57.5/period), and promised lead time is 2, the current pipeline should be sufficient if P17 arrives. However, due to the high failure rate of the supply chain, mu_hat must be set to cover the risk. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the summer demand mean (approx 58) and assume lead time calculation averages the functional observations.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Potential loss of Period 17 order (346 units) suspected as it is now 6 periods overdue. If not arrived by Period 24, total zombie shipments will increase to 1,978 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 24 (July 22, 2019). The product is a Women's Everyday Collection blouse, currently in a stable Summer demand plateau (approx. 50-60 units/week). Pipeline Analysis: 'In-transit' shows 2031 units, but this is heavily contaminated by 'zombie' shipments. Confirmed lost: P1(52), P3(513), P4(512), P10(134), P13(421) = 1632 units. Additionally, the order from P17 (346 units) is now 7 periods overdue (ordered P17, now P24 START) and is classified as lost. Total zombie units = 1632 + 346 = 1978. Functional units = 2031 - 1978 = 53 units. On-hand = 0. Demand Context: Demand has dropped significantly in July, with the most recent sample (P23) at 26 units. To compensate for the 'In-transit' phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set explicitly high to force an order. Since functional inventory (53) + on-hand (0) is insufficient for 3 periods (L+1) of current demand (approx 55*3=165), I will use 'explicit' to drive stock recovery.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Pipeline contamination updated. Period 17 order (346 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed vs L=2). Total zombie shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) now total 1978 units. Functional pipeline as of P24 is 53 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse has entered a Summer low, with demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging approximately 44 units, and the most recent period showing a significant drop to 15 units. The pipeline is severely contaminated with 1,978 units of 'zombie' shipments (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17) which have not arrived and are considered lost. The total in-transit is 2,178, meaning the functional pipeline is only 200 units (147 units from P24 + some other late order, though accounting suggests 147 is the only viable recent flow). Because the OR engine uses the total in-transit (2,178) against its calculated base stock, it will stop ordering entirely if mu_hat is set to the current demand level. To force the system to maintain stock despite the zombie inventory, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value that offsets the zombie units. Target base stock = (Effective Pipeline Need) + Zombie Units. For 3 periods (L+1) at ~50 units/period, we need ~150 units. Adding 1,978 zombies, mu_hat is set to 2,128 to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a small positive order or maintains current flow. Sigma_hat is kept at a moderate level using N=5 to account for recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand decline confirmed as product enters late summer (P24 demand: 15). Functional pipeline is 200 units; cumulative zombie/lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) remain 1,978 units. Mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to bypass pipeline contamination in OR logic.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Womens Everyday Collection Blouse) is in a late-summer lower-demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 37 units/period, showing a sharp decline from the spring peak. The 'In-transit' metric (2178 units) is heavily compromised by 'zombie' shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 13, and 17, which total 1,978 lost units. The functional pipeline consists only of the P24 order (147 units). To ensure the OR backend places any necessary replenishment despite the massive false in-transit figure, I must set mu_hat (the base stock level) to a value that exceeds the 'In-transit' count plus the estimated demand for the lead time. Setting mu_hat to 2300 (zombie units 1978 + safety stock buffer for current demand) will force the logic to recognize a need for stock if functional on-hand/in-transit drops below current needs. L is set to 'calculate' as recent functional shipments (P12) still align with the promised 2-period lead time, despite the high loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P21-P25) stabilized at ~37 units/period, down significantly from Spring/Early-Summer levels. Zombie/lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) remain static at 1,978 units, requiring manual mu_hat inflation to bypass pipeline contamination.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's blouse in the late summer season (August). Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the spring peak. The historical demand for the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 53, 26, 15, 22, 30, averaging 29.2 units per period. The supply chain has significant known reliability issues: 1,978 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) are confirmed lost/zombie shipments that still appear in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The total In-transit is 2,334, meaning the functional pipeline is actually only 356 units (Orders from P24 and P26). Because the backend logic uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide the order quantity, and the pipeline is highly inflated by these 1,978 zombie units, the OR engine will likely never place a new order regardless of need. To force an order, I am explicitly setting mu_hat to cover the current demand (approx 30 * (1+L) = 90) PLUS the total zombie volume (1,978). This mathematical bypass ensures the system accounts for the functionally empty inventory while still targeting the actual low-demand regime of ~30/week. sigma_hat is set to reflect the moderate variance in the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand regime (P22-P26) mean is 29.2 units/period. Zombie shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17) total 1,978 units, significantly inflating In-transit inventory and requiring parameter compensation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August 2019), the product (Womens Everyday Blouse) is in a late-summer low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P23-P27) is 25.2 units, a significant decrease from the Spring peak. However, the system faces severe 'pipeline contamination': 1,978 units are recorded as In-transit (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17) but are confirmed lost or indefinite 'zombie' shipments. The OR backend subtracts the total In-transit (2,334) from the base_stock to calculate new orders. If base_stock is calculated normally (e.g., 3 periods x 25 units = 75), the backend will see 75 - 2,334 = -2,259 and never place an order, resulting in permanent stockouts. To force an order, mu_hat must be explicitly 'inflated' to exceed the zombie noise. Functional pipeline = Total In-transit (2,334) - Zombie units (1,978) = 356 units (Orders from P24 and P26). With these 356 functional units expected soon, and demand at ~25/period, we are covered for the immediate term. I will keep mu_hat inflated to ensure the pipeline eventually clears the zombie threshold while using recent demand N=5 for sigma to capture current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late-summer demand (P23-P27) stabilized at 25.2 units/period. Zombie/lost shipments remain at 1,978 units. Functional pipeline is 356 units (P24, P26 orders).

LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (2019/8/26), a period where historical demand for cotton blouses remains low but stable (late summer/early autumn transition). Recent demand (P24-P28) averages 24 units/period. The critical operational challenge is 'pipeline contamination': the 'In-transit' metric shows 2411 units, but 1978 of these are confirmed 'zombie' shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17 that will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists only of P24 (147 units), P26 (156 units), and P28 (77 units), totaling 380 units. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, it will see 2411 units and order nothing if I use default parameters. To force an order that covers real demand (L+1 = 3 periods), I must explicitly set mu_hat to inflate the base stock target enough to offset the 1978 zombie units. Functional target: (3 periods * 24 units) = 72 units. Necessary mu_hat: 72 + 1978 = 2050 units. I use L='calculate' to capture the inherent supply chain instability even though arrivals are sparse.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a low-demand late-summer/early-autumn regime. Recent demand (P25-P29) has stabilized around an average of 26.8 units/period. The primary challenge remains severe pipeline contamination: 'In-transit' shows 2411 units, but 1978 of these are confirmed 'zombie' units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17) that are long overdue and presumed lost. Subtracting these leaves a functional pipeline of 433 units (orders from P24, P26, and P28). With promised L=2, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 81 units). Since the functional pipeline (433) already exceeds this, the OR logic would naturally order 0. However, the OR engine sees the total in-transit (2411), which is much larger than the needed stock. To prevent the system from being paralyzed by this contamination and ensure it can respond if the functional pipeline is also lost, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that bridges the gap between the zombie inventory and the intended base stock. Specifically, setting mu_hat such that (mu_hat - Total_In_Transit) \u2248 target order. Given the functional pipeline is sufficient for current demand, I will set mu_hat to 2511 to allow for a small buffer while the backend handles the cap. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the consistent delays for units that actually do arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Zombie shipments (lost) remain at 1978 units. Functional pipeline is 433 units (P24, P26, P28). Late-summer/Early-autumn demand (P25-P29) mean is 26.8 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has stabilized into an early-Autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P26-P30) averaging 29.2 units. The primary challenge remains the 'zombie' pipeline inventory. Total in-transit is 2444 units, but historically, shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17 (totaling 1978 units) are confirmed lost. Additionally, orders from P24 (147) and P26 (156) are now overdue (6 and 4 periods respectively), significantly exceeding the promised L=2 and the recently successful L=2 for the P28 shipment which arrived in P30. I will treat P24 and P26 as highly suspect/lost, bringing the estimated zombie total to 2281 units. The functional pipeline consists only of the P30 order (110 units). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 2444 in-transit units as available stock and thus suppressing new orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to (Avg Demand * (1+L)) + Zombie Inventory. Using a stabilized mean of 30 and L=2, mu_hat = (30 * 3) + 2281 \u2248 2371. This forces the engine to order against the functional inventory (43 on-hand + 110 functional in-transit) while ignoring the 2281 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Pipeline contamination updated to 2281 units as orders from P24 (147 units) and P26 (156 units) are now 7 and 5 periods overdue respectively, joining previously lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17). Early-Autumn demand regime (P26-P30) stabilized at ~29 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Women's Everyday Collection blouse has stabilized into an early Autumn regime (avg ~29 units/period). However, the central management challenge remains significant pipeline contamination. Total 'In-transit' inventory is 2,444 units, but historically, the following orders are confirmed lost or 'zombie' shipments: P1 (52), P3 (513), P4 (512), P10 (134), P13 (421), P17 (346), P24 (147), and P26 (156). This results in 2,281 units of non-recoverable pipeline. Only the Period 28 shipment (77 units, arrived P30) and Period 30 shipment (110 units, due P32/P33) are functional. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously halting orders due to high 'In-transit' numbers, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat inflation. By setting mu_hat to a value that exceeds the zombie inventory plus the desired base stock (Target Base Stock ~ 120 units + 2281 Zombie = 2401), I force the logic to maintain a flow of fresh inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent functional arrivals (P28) returned to the promised 2-period window, though reliability remains poor.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination updated to 2281 units: Orders from P24 (147) and P26 (156) are now confirmed lost/zombie shipments, joining P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P17. Functional pipeline as of P32 consists only of the P30 order (110 units).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Everyday Collection' blouse has stabilized in an Early-Autumn regime (late September). Over the last five periods (P28-P32), the average demand is 29.4 units per period. The pipeline is heavily contaminated with 2,281 units of 'zombie' stock (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26) which the OR backend incorrectly views as incoming inventory. Recent successful deliveries from P28 and P30 confirm a functional lead time of 2 periods for active orders. To account for the 2,281 units of ghost inventory that will never arrive, the 'mu_hat' parameter must be significantly inflated. I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 2,370 based on the formula: (Mean Demand * (1 + L)) + Zombie Inventory. Using a target mean of 30, (30 * 3) + 2281 \u2248 2371. This ensures the OR logic recognizes a need for new stock despite the inflated 'In-transit' metric. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a sufficient safety buffer for potential autumn demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed functional lead time of 2 periods (P28 arrived P30; P30 arrived P32). Pipeline contamination remains at 2,281 units. Early-Autumn demand regime (P28-P32) mean is 29.4 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30 (Autumn). Demand has stabilized into an early-Autumn regime, with the most recent demand (P33) showing a slight uptick to 65 units, though the average over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is ~38 units. The primary challenge remains 'pipeline contamination'. The system shows 2,334 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, 2,281 units are confirmed lost/zombie shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26). The functional pipeline is currently 0 units (P30 arrived in P32). Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will not place a needed order unless \u03bc\u0302 is significantly inflated. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover the Autumn demand (~38 units/period) plus the 3-period lead-time risk (L+1=3) despite the 2,281 zombie units, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 to 2400 (explicit) to force an order that clears the zombie inventory hurdle. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent functional arrivals (P28, P30) adhered to the promised 2-period window.

Carry-over insight: Early-Autumn demand regime (P29-P33) mean is 38.4 units/period. Pipeline contamination persists at 2,281 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering October (early Autumn). Demand has stabilized around an average of 38 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P29-P33 range: 29-65). Pipeline inventory is severely contaminated with 2,281 'zombie' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26). The OR logic subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the target base stock, so to trigger any new orders, mu_hat must be artificially inflated to 'bypass' this 2,281-unit ghost inventory. The functional lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (as seen in P30 and P32 conclusions). Therefore, I'm setting L to default (2 periods) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the target demand for L+1 periods (Approx 40 units * 3 = 120) PLUS the 2,281 zombie units, totaling 2,401. This ensures the OR backend recognizes a need for stock despite the misleading in-transit total.

Carry-over insight: Early-Autumn demand regime (P29-P33) confirmed at a mean of 38.4 units. Pipeline contamination remains high at 2,281 units; automated logic requires mu_hat inflation of +2,281 to generate orders.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 675068002 (Cotton Blouse) is in an Early-Autumn demand regime with a mean of ~38 units/period (P29-P35 avg: 37.7). There is a critical supply chain issue: 'In-transit' inventory includes 2,281 units from lost/zombie shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26) which will never arrive. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from its target base stock before ordering. Since in-transit (2423) >> required base stock, the engine will order 0 unless the mu_hat parameter is explicitly inflated to offset the 2,281 zombie units. The actual functional pipeline is 89 units (P34, P35 orders). To trigger a replenishment order of approximately 50 units (to cover 3 periods of demand at ~38/unit), the target mu_hat must be set to: (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Zombie units. (38 * 3) + 2281 = 114 + 2281 = 2395. Lead time L=2 is restored as recent orders (P28, P30) arrived on time.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. Demand has stabilized into an early-autumn regime with an average of approximately 38 units per period (P29-P36 range: 24-65). A critical issue remains: 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 2398 units, but history confirms that 2281 of these are 'zombie' units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, and P26). The actual functional pipeline consists only of the P34 order (64 units), which is expected to arrive shortly. Because the OR backend subtracts the total In-transit (including zombies) from its target base stock, it will not place orders unless the target exceeds ~2398 units. To force necessary replenishment, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculated as (1 + Promised_L) * Current_Demand + Zombie_Inventory = (1 + 2) * 38 + 2281 = 114 + 2281 = 2395. This value serves to neutralize the phantom inventory in the backend logic while targeting a safety stock for the actual expected demand. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level to accommodate recent demand fluctuations (std of P29-P36 is approx 14; sqrt(3)*14 \u2248 24).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Pipeline contamination confirmed at 2281 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26). Functional lead time for recent arrivals (P35) was 1 period, but 2 periods remains a safer planning baseline. Autumn demand regime (P29-P36) mean is 36.6 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28, transitioning into late Autumn/Pre-Holiday. Demand spiked to 82 units in Period 37, significantly higher than the previous Autumn mean of ~36 units, possibly signaling a seasonal shift or pre-holiday activity. Pipeline contamination remains extreme at 2,281 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26) which never arrive but occupy the 'In-transit' metric. Total 'In-transit' is 2,415, while functional 'In-transit' is only 81 units (P34 order of 64 plus P37 order of 17). To force the OR backend to place an order when on-hand is 0 and it perceives a massive stock-on-hand via zombie pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover the zombie units plus the expected demand for the lead time (L=2). Calculated mu_hat = (Zombie Pipeline [2281] + Baseline Demand for L+1 [~45 * 3 = 135]) = 2416. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility (30 to 82 range).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand spike detected (82 units) suggesting a late Autumn/Pre-Holiday regime shift. Pipeline contamination remains constant at 2,281 units as P24 and P26 orders are now confirmed lost. Functional lead time is stable at 1-2 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are observing a significant demand spike in the last two periods (82 units in P37 and 165 units in P38), confirming a holiday/pre-winter season regime shift for this blouse. The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~95 units, compared to the early Autumn average of 36.6. Pipeline contamination (zombie shipments) remains at 2,281 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26). Additionally, the order from P34 (64 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing the total contamination to 2,345 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' (2,435 units) in its order calculation. To force an order, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - In-transit' is positive. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for the new demand level (approx 95 units/period) plus the identified zombie units to bypass the backend's logic error regarding non-existent stock. I estimate a forward-looking mu_hat of (1+L)*95 + 2345. With L=2, this is 3*95 + 2345 = 2630. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility of the current spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Winter regime shift confirmed: demand increased from ~37 to ~95 avg (+150%). Pipeline contamination updated to 2345 units: P34 order (64 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost, joining the existing 2281 units of zombie stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, and we have entered a high-demand Holiday/Winter regime for this cotton shirt (confirmed by demands of 82, 165, and 112 in the last three periods). The mean demand for this recent regime (P37-P39) is approximately 119.7 units. However, we face severe 'pipeline contamination'. The system shows 2734 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms that 2345 units are 'zombie' or lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, and P34). These units will never arrive but are subtracted from the order quantity by the OR logic. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to be approximately equal to [zombie_stock + (regime_mean * (L+1))]. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should be 2345 + (120 * 3) = 2705. I will set L to 2 periods as recent successful arrivals (P35, P37) took 1 period, making 2 a safe planning buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high volatility observed during regime shifts.

Carry-over insight: Holiday/Winter demand regime shift confirmed: demand avg increased from ~37 to ~120 (+220%). Total confirmed lost/zombie shipments increased to 2345 units after P34 (64 units) failed to arrive after 5 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 (mid-November), entering the peak Winter/Holiday demand season. Recent demand (P38-P40) has spiked to an average of 134.7 units, representing a significant shift from the Autumn average of ~37. The 'In-transit' metric of 2832 units is heavily contaminated by 2345 units of confirmed lost/zombie shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, and now P34). The functional pipeline consists only of orders from P35 (arrived), P37 (arrived), P39 (299 units), and P40 (98 units). To ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order despite the 2345 units of lost stock inflating the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on the recent demand average of 135 units across (L+1=3) periods, which is 405 units. I then add the 2345 zombie units to this target, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 2750. This 'fools' the logic into seeing a gap between the inflated baseline and the contaminated 'In-transit' figure, triggering a necessary order for the holiday peak. L is set to 'default' as recent functional arrivals (P35, P37) confirm a reliable lead time of 1-2 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the Holiday/Winter demand regime, which started around Period 37. Average demand from Period 38 to 41 is approximately 130 units per period (165, 112, 127, 115), a significant increase from the Autumn average of ~37. In-transit inventory remains heavily contaminated by 'zombie' shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, and now P34 ($52+513+512+134+421+346+147+156+64 = 2345$ units). These units will never arrive but are subtracted from the order calculation by the OR backend. To counteract this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to the desired safety stock level plus the zombie count. For Period 42, with a lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for 3 periods (P42, P43, P44). Estimated demand is ~130/period. Base stock target = $130 \times 3 + \text{buffer} \approx 500$ units. Inflated mu_hat = $500 + 2345 = 2845$. On-hand is 184 and the only functional in-transit is the P40 order (98 units). This setting should trigger a sufficient order to maintain stock through the peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), navigating the peak Holiday/Winter demand regime. Demand has surged to an average of ~162 units over the last 5 periods (P38-P42: 165, 112, 127, 115, 295). Supply chain remains erratic; while P39 arrived in 2 periods (L=2), P40 (98 units) is currently in its expected arrival window. The primary challenge is 'pipeline contamination': 2,345 units are confirmed lost/zombie shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, P34). The current 'In-transit' figure of 2,533 units includes these 2,345 useless units plus the P40 order (98 units) and the P38 order (37 units, which is now 5 periods old and likely lost, adding another 37 to the lost count for a total of 2,382 confirmed lost). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high 'In-transit' count, mu_hat must be explicitly set to (1+L) * Forecast + Pipeline_Contamination. Using L=2, Forecast=160, and Pipeline_Contamination=2382, mu_hat = (3 * 160) + 2382 = 2862. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for high holiday variance (recent demand has swung between 112 and 295).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Pipeline contamination increased to 2,382 units as the P38 order (37 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Holiday demand remains intense with a recent spike to 295 units in P42.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 occurs during the high-demand Holiday/Winter season (December). Recent demand spikes (P42: 295, P40: 127) indicate a much higher regime than the previous Autumn average. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 141.8 units. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with significant 'zombie' units in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost/zombie shipments have reached 2,382 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38). These units are counted in the OR backend's 'In-transit' figure but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset these 2,382 units plus the expected demand for the (L+1) window. With L=3 (observed in P43) and a forecast of ~142 units/period, the target base stock should be (142 * 4) + 2382 \u2248 2950. Setting mu_hat to 2950 with L=3 effectively instructs the backend that we need ~2950 units to cover the pipeline contamination and upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination updated to 2,382 units: P38 order (37 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods. Holiday demand regime (P39-P43) mean is 141.8 units/period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (Dec 16), demand is within the late-year high-demand regime, with Period 44 demand at 73 and an average demand since Period 39 (start of the Holiday/Winter spike) of 130.3 units per period. The supply chain remains compromised by extensive pipeline contamination. Total confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38) sum to 2,419 units (including P38, which is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost). Total In-transit is reported at 3,063 units, but the functional pipeline only consists of Period 43 (456 units), Period 44 (172 units), and potentially some lingering units from P39/P40 if they hadn't arrived, though P39 and P40 orders arrived in P41 and P43 respectively. Subtracting the zombie total (2,419) from reported In-transit (3,063) leaves a functional pipeline of 644 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 2,419 zombie units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculated as (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Total_Zombie_Units. With L=2 (promised and recent typical), and weekly forecast ~130, required stock is ~390. Thus, mu_hat = 390 + 2419 = 2809. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination updated to 2,419 units: P38 order (37 units) is confirmed lost after 7 periods. Functional pipeline is 644 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), peak holiday/winter season for women's blouses. Demand has been high but volatile (P39-P45 mean ~120). Pipeline contamination is extreme at 2,419 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38). These 2,419 units will never arrive but are counted in the OR backend's 'In-transit' figure, which effectively prevents the system from placing new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. Recent lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods (P43 arrived in 2, P40 in 3). Using L=2 as a planning base. Current functional pipeline is 172 units (Period 44 order), and on-hand is 397. Expected demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) is ~360 units. The pipeline contamination (2,419) plus the required base stock (~360) leads to an explicit mu_hat setting to ensure the OR logic continues to replenish stock during this high-demand window.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination updated to 2,419 units: P38 order (37 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods without arrival. Holiday demand regime (P39-P45) mean is 120.1 units/period with high variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, concluding the Holiday/Winter season. Demand has cooled from the late-November peak, with the last 4 periods averaging approximately 61 units (P43-P46: 60, 73, 59, 52). Pipeline contamination remains the primary challenge: 2,419 units are confirmed lost/zombie shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38). These units are present in the 'In-transit' count of 2,607, but will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists only of the Period 44 order (172 units). To force the OR backend to place an order when the functional stock (On-hand 345 + functional In-transit 172 = 517) is insufficient for the forecasted demand regime, I must explicitly set mu_hat to include the 'zombie' units. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * (recent mean) + zombie count = (1+2) * 61 + 2419 \u2248 2602. Lead time is set to 2 as the most common functional delivery time. Sigma_hat is set to 120 (approx sqrt(3)*70) to account for high residual variance from holiday spikes.

Carry-over insight: Post-Holiday demand stabilization: Mean demand (P43-P46) has decreased to ~61 units/period. Pipeline contamination persists at 2,419 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P17, P24, P26, P34, P38).
