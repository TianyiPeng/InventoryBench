Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 573937001 (Women's Skinny High-Waist Jeans). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 53.6 units/week (range 43-64). There is no current on-hand inventory or units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Given the product type (jeans), demand is relatively stable in early February. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the base demand level. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend OR engine will target a 50% service level for the base stock calculation (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5). To ensure we cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (1), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 5 samples to establish an initial inventory position.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is H&M+ skinny jeans. Initial demand in Period 1 was 45 units, but we had 0 on-hand, resulting in lost sales. There are 70 units in-transit from Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the Period 1 order (70 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 64, 46, 43, 52, 63 (Mean: 53.6, Std Dev: 9.3). The Period 1 demand of 45 is consistent with this range. Since we have zero on-hand and the first shipment won't arrive until Period 3, the goal is to set parameters that ensure the base stock covers current and lead-time demand (L+1 = 3 periods). Using N=5 for demand captures the recent 'normal' volume. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) as there is no evidence yet of deviations.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history (Jan 7 to Feb 18) shows values: 64, 46, 43, 52, 63, 45, 60. The mean of these 7 samples is 53.28 with a standard deviation of 8.94. Demand appears stable around 50-60 units. Inventories are currently 0 on-hand because we started with 0 and deliveries haven't arrived yet. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (70 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. The order from Period 2 (64 units) is expected in Period 4. Total pipeline is 134. Since the lead time is L=2, the backend uses a (3-period) forecasting window for mu_hat. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the most stable baseline. Sigma is set to recent_N=7 to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is H&M+ skinny leggings, a staple item. We are currently in early March (Period 4), entering the spring season. Historical demand (recent 5 weeks: 64, 46, 43, 52, 63) averages 53.6, but the first 3 periods of the game show a significant upward trajectory (45 -> 60 -> 66), averaging 57.0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (70 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible now, but 'arrived=0' in Period 3 conclude suggests a delay or that lead time starts counting after the decision period. Specifically, an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives in P3 (visible P4). Since P4 start shows 0 on-hand, we are currently experiencing a stockout (sold=0 for P1-P3). I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the higher game-period demand (avg 57) over (1+L)=3 periods, totaling 171. Sigma_hat will be based on the game-period volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is H&M+ skinny jeans. Analysis of historical demand (5 samples: 64, 46, 43, 52, 63) and recent period-by-period demand (45, 60, 66, 74) shows a clear upward trend. The mean of the last 5 samples is 53.6, but the 'Period 4' demand was 74. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). We have 107 units in transit (70 ordered P1, 26 ordered P3, 11 ordered P4). The Period 1 order (70 units) is overdue or potentially lost based on the 'Period 4 conclude' showing only the Period 2 arrival. However, normally a 2-period lead time means a P1 order should have arrived in P3. Given the stockout (sold 64 units out of 74 demand in P4) and the increasing trend, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent higher demand (60, 66, 74; avg ~66.7) and set L to 'calculate' to let the backend handle lead time variability. High sigma is maintained via recent_N to buffer against the volatility (45 to 74).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Increasing trend observed over the last 4 periods (45, 60, 66, 74). Significant stockout in Period 4 due to order sequence/lead-time arrival (P2 arrived before or without P1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face a critical stockout situation. The item is 'H&M+ Skinny Jeans', and historical demand shows an increasing trend (45, 60, 66, 74, 63) with a mean around 61.6 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 2. We have 0 on-hand and 186 in-transit. Looking at lead-time history: Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). Period 1's order (70 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P1, expected P3, now P6), suggesting it is likely lost. Period 3's order (26 units) was expected in Period 5 but hasn't arrived; it may arrive in Period 6 or be lost. Period 4's order (11 units) and Period 5's order (79 units) are still within the lead time window. Due to the high risk of a lost P1 shipment and the 0 on-hand inventory, I am setting L=2 (promised) but calculating mu_hat using recent_N=5 (all periods) to capture the higher mean of ~61.6, resulting in a base stock goal covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~185 units). Since current pipeline (186) might include lost units, maintaining a robust mu_hat/sigma_hat is necessary to trigger replenishment once the OR backend realizes the pipeline isn't resolving.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (70 units) confirmed lost/extremely delayed (5 periods since order, promised 2). Current demand regime stabilized around 60-70 units/period after initial ramp-up.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory status shows 34 units on-hand and 107 in-transit. History suggests a volatile supply chain: P1 (ordered P1) is lost, P2 arrived on time (2 periods), P3 and P4 are missing (overdue), and P5 arrived early (1 period). This variability necessitates an adjustment to the lead-time parameter. Since P5 arrived in 1 period but P2 took 2, 'calculate' is used to average observed actual lead times. Demand has stabilized after an initial ramp-up: the last 6 periods of game history show 45, 60, 66, 74, 63, 45. Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat centers the forecast around 59 units/period (354 total for L+1=3). Given the profit/holding ratio (1.0/1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher volatility seen during the ramp-up and stockout periods, providing a safety buffer for the unreliable in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P5 arrived in 1 period, P2 in 2 periods, while P1, P3, and P4 remain outstanding/lost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 573937001 is currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) following a demand of 83 units in Period 7. Analysis of the arrival history confirms significant supply chain unreliability: Orders from Period 1 (70 units), Period 3 (26 units), and Period 4 (11 units) are now 7, 5, and 4 periods overdue respectively, against a promised lead time of 2. These 107 units are likely lost. The pipeline (In-transit: 143) consists of these lost units plus the order from Period 7 (36 units). Recent demand (Periods 4-7: 74, 63, 45, 83) averages approximately 66 units per period. Given the high stockout risk and unreliable arrivals, I will use an explicit L of 2 (promised) but set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand window (3 periods * 66 units/period = 198). This will force the OR backend to place an order that bridges the gap between the 36 valid units in transit and the required 198 base stock, effectively ignoring the 107 lost units in its calculation.

Carry-over insight: Sustained supply chain failure: Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (107 units total) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed as of Period 8. Demand remains volatile but averages ~66 units over the last 4 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU 573937001 is facing a severe supply chain reliability issue. Orders from Period 1 (70 units), Period 3 (26 units), and Period 4 (11 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, as they are significantly past their promised 2-period lead time. The OR backend's 'Pipeline Inventory' calculation includes these lost units, which prevents it from placing necessary replenishment orders. To compensate, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the OR's internal calculation. Demand has shown an upward trend and high volatility, with the last 4 periods averaging 71.75 units (45, 83, 96, and the previous 63). For Period 9, I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~75 units across (L+1) periods. Since the promised L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*75 = 225. Because the OR backend subtracts the 162 in-transit units (which include the ~107 lost units), this mu_hat of 225 should trigger an order of approximately 60-70 units, which is needed to cover upcoming demand given that on-hand is currently 0. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the high recent volatility (std ~20).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 107 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4). Explicit mu_hat calculation is required to force ordering until the backend pipeline clears or stabilizes.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the stock level is critical. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 225 units is inflated by 107 confirmed lost units (orders from P1, P3, and P4), which the OR backend still believes are coming. This prevents the backend from placing new orders (in-transit > base_stock). To force an order and bypass this pipeline inflation, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand (P6-P9) averages 66 units/period. With a total lead time coverage need of L+1 = 3 periods, mu_hat should ideally be ~198. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom pipeline (107 lost units + P8/P9 orders), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that covers immediate demand. The actual valid pipeline is P8 (55) + P9 (63) = 118 units. Expected demand until these arrive is ~132. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost units and ensure a safety buffer, while keeping L at the promised 2 (since recent successful arrivals for P5 and P7 were 1 period, but P2 was 2).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 107 units from P1, P3, P4 are confirmed lost but still occupy 'In-transit' logic. Explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat are being used to counteract this until the backend's view of the pipeline resolves or stabilizes.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'ED Madison Skinny HW' (jeans) shows an on-hand inventory of 75. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 192 is significantly inflated by lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Period 1 (70 units), Period 3 (26 units), and Period 4 (11 units), totaling 107 units. These orders have not arrived after 7-10 periods (promised lead time is 2). If I use the default backend logic, it will subtract the full 192-unit pipeline from the base stock, resulting in zero new orders and a high risk of stockout once the current 75 units are sold. Recent demand (last 4 periods: 83, 96, 40, 43) averages ~65.5 units. To ensure the backend places an order, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the current on-hand plus the truly viable pipeline. With P10 (85 units) likely arriving soon, the viable 'In-transit' is 85. The target base stock for (L+1=3) periods should be ~200 units (66*3). To force an order of ~40-50 units despite the 107-unit phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 300.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, the system is managing SKU 573937001 (Women's high waist skinny jeans). The demand has settled into a lower regime over the last 3 periods (40, 43, 44), averaging 42.3 units, down from the earlier volatile peaks (83, 96). There are 107 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost as they have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2 periods (now 8-11 periods overdue). The 'In-transit' figure is currently 225, which includes these 107 phantom units plus more recent orders (P10: 85, P11: 33). If the OR backend calculates on-hand (31) + pipeline (225) = 256, it will likely stop ordering entirely, assuming massive overstock. To force a replenish for the next cycle (Lead time 2 + Review period 1 = 3 periods of demand), I set an explicit mu_hat that compensates for this pipeline inflation. Targeted inventory needed is roughly 42.5 * 3 = 127.5. Since the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline', I maintain an 'explicit' inflated mu_hat to ensure the calculated base stock exceeds the inflated pipeline enough to trigger a small replenishment or at least maintain readiness. The sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the historical variability observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand has dropped from ~66 units to ~43 units over the last 3 periods (Period 9-11). Lost inventory (107 units) continues to inflate the backend pipeline calculation.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the SKU is in a state of high stockout (on-hand=0) despite 225 units in-transit. A critical analysis of the pipeline reveals that 107 units (orders from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/delayed, yet they still occupy the 'In-transit' calculation used by the OR backend. Recent demand (P9-P12) has stabilized at a lower mean of 41.5 units compared to earlier periods. To force an order and bypass the phantom 107 units in the pipeline, I set an explicit mu_hat. Base stock is calculated as (L+1)*demand + safety_stk. With L=2 and mean demand ~42, base stock should be ~126. However, since the backend sees 225 in transit, it will order 0 unless I inflate mu_hat. I am targeting an order of approximately 50-60 units to bridge the current stockout and provide buffer for the next 2-period lead time. I set mu_hat explicitly to 350 to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - 225) results in a meaningful replenishment order while accounting for the lower recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 9-12 mean demand is 41.5 units (prev ~66). Pipeline inflation from lost orders (P1, P3, P4 = 107 units) persists, requiring explicit parameter inflation to trigger ordering.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face a critical stockout (on-hand: 0) and a persistent data integrity issue regarding 'In-transit' inventory. We have 107 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost, but they remain in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, preventing new orders. To force an order, we must inflate the 'base_stock' to exceed both the real and the ghost pipeline. Demand has stabilized at a lower level (~42 units/period since Period 9). The target inventory for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (42 * 3 = 126) plus a safety buffer needs to be much higher than the current Pipeline (313). I will use 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a base stock high enough to overcome the 313 in-transit units and trigger an order to alleviate the stockout. Setting mu_hat to 450 (covering demand and the ghost inventory) and sigma_hat to 60 to protect service levels.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory (313 units) contains 107 lost units (P1, P3, P4). Explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat adjustments are required to bypass 'In-transit' logic until these ghost units clear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has spiked to 67 in the last period, significantly higher than the previous 4-period average of 41.5. This suggests a potential demand shift as we approach late May. The pipeline inventory (450 units) is heavily inflated by 107 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4) and several delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P10 (85 units), P12 (0), P13 (121), and P14 (137) are in-transit. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 450 units of pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, it will fail to place new orders unless mu_hat is set explicitly high enough to exceed this 'ghost' pipeline. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 620 to account for (L+1) demand around 60-70 units while bypassing the 107 lost units and ensuring we maintain stock for the upcoming periods. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to handle the recent volatility and demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 14 saw a spike to 67 units after a period of stability around 42 units. Pipeline still contains 107 lost units (P1, P3, P4) that have not been reconciled by the backend, requiring continued explicit parameter inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face a compounded supply problem. First, 107 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). Second, while 'In-transit' shows 620 units, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have faced repetitive stockouts since Period 12. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 39, 43, 67, 109) shows a clear and aggressive upward trend, likely seasonal for '5-pocket jeans' as we move into summer. The mean demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 65 units, but the last two periods (67 and 109) suggest a regime shift toward 80-100 units. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'In-transit' inflation (620 units total - 107 lost = 513 actual potential incoming), I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the pipeline inventory. The calculation base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat must exceed 620. By setting mu_hat = 750 (representing a high-demand forecast of ~250 per period over L+1) and sigma_hat = 150, I ensure the ordering mechanism remains active to capture the seasonal spike and compensate for the lost units that the OR backend still believes are coming.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Seasonal Spike): Significant demand increase observed in Periods 14-15 (67, 109) compared to previous stability (~42). Pipeline inventory (620) is still heavily distorted by 107 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573937001' (Skinny Jeans) is experiencing a significant demand surge matching early June seasonality. Recent demand (P14-P16) is 67, 109, and 81 units, yielding a 3-period average of 85.7 units. The backend 'In-transit' figure is 750 units, but this includes 107 units confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (unfilled for 12+ periods) and units from P14-P16 which have not arrived. Given the 1-2 period lead time variability and current zero on-hand inventory, there is a severe risk of stockouts during this high-demand period. I am setting mu_hat to 1200 (L=2) to force the OR backend's capped policy to place an order. This high explicit value ensures that even with the 'In-transit' inflation of 750 (including 107 ghost units), the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) remains below the target base stock, triggering necessary replenishment to meet the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Late May/Early June demand for skinny jeans increased to avg 85.7 units/period from previous avg 42 (+100%). Lead time variability persists (1-2 periods).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), we are in a seasonal peak for skinny jeans. Demand in Period 15-16 was very high (109, 81), though Period 17 saw a dip to 49. The average demand of the last 4 periods is (67+109+81+49)/4 = 76.5 units. The primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' pipeline inflation: 107 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost but are still counted by the OR backend. Current in-transit is 900. Total known lost units are 107. However, looking at the history, orders from P13 (121) and P14 (137) are also significantly overdue (5 and 4 periods since ordering, vs. promised 2), totaling another 258 units likely lost or delayed. If we assume P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 are all lost, the 'ghost' pipeline is 365 units. Current On-hand is 251. We received 300 units in Period 17 (from P15 and P16). A large order of 450 units was placed in P17. Given the current on-hand (251) and the massive P17 order arriving soon, we should stabilize parameters. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the seasonal average (~80) over the L+1 window, and use an explicit sigma_hat to handle the high volatility (std dev of recent spikes is ~25). Setting L to 2 (promised). mu_hat = (1+2)*80 = 240. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2)*25 = 43.3. This conservative setting will allow the backend to digest the large P17 order while maintaining a safety buffer for the season.

Carry-over insight: Significant additional supply chain failure suspected: Orders from Period 13 (121 units) and Period 14 (137 units) are now 4+ periods overdue, suggesting a total of 365 units (including P1, P3, P4) are likely lost in the pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 19 (2019/6/17). The seasonal peak for skinny jeans observed in May/June appears to be cooling off, with demand dropping from 109 and 81 down to 49 and 35 over the last two periods. However, inventory management remains severely complicated by pipeline distortion. History shows that orders from P1, P3, P4 (107 units), P13 (121 units), and P14 (137 units) are highly likely lost, totaling 365 'ghost' units in the In-transit figure of 900. Additionally, P17 (450 units) is expected to arrive in Period 19 or 20. The current on-hand inventory is 216, which covers current demand levels (~40/week) safely for about 5 weeks. Given the 365 lost units and the 450 units still in transit from P17, the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' view of 900 is significantly higher than the 'real' active pipeline (approx 535 units). However, because we currently have high on-hand stock and demand is declining from its peak, I will shift toward 'recent_N' to allow the system to naturally stabilize while monitoring if the P17 shipment (450 units) arrives. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat to reflect the cooling demand (avg 42) rather than the peak avg, and default L (2) to align with promised arrival windows.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure expanded: 365 units total likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) as of Period 19. Seasonal demand peak (late May) has subsided, returning to a regime of ~40 units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand has stabilized at a lower post-peak level, averaging roughly 46 units over the last 3 periods (35, 55, 49). However, the critical issue is a massive distortion in the 'In-transit' inventory. According to game history, 365 units are highly likely lost (P1: 70, P3: 26, P4: 11, P13: 121, P14: 137), as they are significantly past the promised lead time of 2. The OR backend's 'pipeline inventory' logic (currently 900 units) prevents any new orders because it believes supply is sufficient, despite no arrivals in the last two periods and the high likelihood of loss. To force the system to consider new orders while protecting against holding costs (Profit=1, Holding=1 suggests a 50% service level target), I must use the 'explicit' method. I am setting mu_hat slightly above the current on-hand minus expected demand for (L+1) periods. With on-hand at 161 and expected demand for 3 periods around 138, the current stock covers the immediate future, so I will set mu_hat to 140 to avoid over-ordering while monitoring if any overdue shipments finally arrive.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain breakdown: 365 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) are considered lost as of Period 20. Post-seasonal demand (late June) has settled to a mean of ~46 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in a post-seasonal demand regime. Demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) has averaged 39 units (49, 35, 55, 17), indicating the late-spring peak has fully subsided. The Supply Chain situation remains severely compromised: 365 units from older periods (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) are confirmed lost, as they have not arrived despite the promised 2-period lead time passing by many weeks. The current 'In-transit' figure of 900 units is composed of these 365 lost units, plus the large order of 450 units from Period 17 and subsequent smaller orders. The OR backend subtracts the full 900 units from the base stock. Currently, On-hand inventory is 144, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3.5 periods of demand at the current rate (~40/period). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and the high on-hand levels, the strategy is to allow inventory to draw down. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to moderate levels based on recent demand (N=4), the backend's inflated pipeline view (which includes the lost units) will naturally result in zero new orders, which is desirable to avoid excessive holding costs while we burn through current stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand regime confirmed: Period 17-20 mean demand is 39 units/period, down from the peak of ~85.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the product (skinny jeans) has moved past its late-May/early-June seasonal peak. Analysis of the last 4 periods (P18-P21) shows demand has dropped significantly to a mean of 35 units/period (35, 55, 17, 33). The pipeline inventory (900 units) remains severely distorted by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14, totaling 365 'ghost' units. However, even accounting for these losses, current on-hand inventory (111 units) covers more than 3 periods of the current demand regime. There is no immediate need to order more. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly ordering based on the inflated pipeline or from failing to order due to high on-hand levels, I will use 'explicit' parameters. I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) period to 105 (3 periods * 35 units) and sigma_hat to 30 to allow the system to rest while current inventory depletes. Lead time L is set to calculated as recent arrivals show a mix of 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-seasonal demand regime shift (July): Mean demand stabilized at ~35 units/period (P18-P21) from the previous peak of 85. Significant pipeline distortion: 365 units confirmed lost (P1, 3, 4, 13, 14) but still visible in In-transit.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15th), we are in a post-seasonal demand regime for skinny jeans. Demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) has averaged ~38.4 units/period, down significantly from the May/June peak. The 'In-transit' balance of 900 units is severely compromised by historical losses: 365 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 are confirmed lost, and the large P17 order (450 units) is now 6 periods overdue, suggesting it is also lost or indefinitely delayed. Total likely lost units in the pipeline = 815. This leaves an 'actual' pipeline of ~85 units plus on-hand inventory of 59. Given current mean demand is ~39 units, we have enough physical stock to cover the next few periods. No new orders are needed; however, the OR backend's pipeline logic is blocked by the 900 ghost units. To prevent premature orders while we burn through on-hand stock, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to reflect the stable July regime and rely on the existing on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Cumulative supply chain failure confirmed. Total estimated lost units in pipeline: 815 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and now P17). Current demand regime (P18-P22) mean is 38.4 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for the last 6 periods has stabilized at a post-seasonal mean of ~38.5 units (35, 55, 17, 33, 52, 39). The 'In-transit' figure of 900 units is severely distorted by cumulative supply chain failures. Based on previous tracking, we consider 815 units effectively lost (P1: 70, P3: 26, P4: 11, P13: 121, P14: 137, P17: 450). This leaves only 85 units (from P10) as potentially viable in-transit inventory. The OR engine subtracts the full 900 'In-transit' from the base stock, which would prevent any new orders and lead to a stockout as on-hand is only 20. To bypass this, I am using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to force the backend to place an order. Target base stock = (Mean Demand * (L+1)) + (Z * StdDev * sqrt(L+1)). With Mean=38.5, L=2, and StdDev ~13, base stock should be ~150. Given 900 in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1050 to ensure an order of ~130 units (1050 - 900 - 20).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative supply chain failure reaches 815 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). July demand regime confirmed stable at ~38-40 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25, we are in a post-seasonal demand regime with an average demand of approximately 40 units per period (Period 21-24: 33, 52, 39, 22). The lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods when orders actually arrive. The primary challenge remains the severe distortion of 'In-transit' inventory. According to the record, 815 units are effectively lost or indefinitely delayed: P1 (70), P3 (26), P4 (11), P13 (121), P14 (137), and P17 (450). While P17 is the largest single lost shipment (now 8 periods since order), its continued presence in the backend's 'In-transit' count (1030 total) prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I estimate the base stock needed to cover 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of 40/period to be 120 units. To trigger an order despite the 1030 ghost units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to a level higher than the current 'In-transit' total plus current demand coverage. By setting mu_hat to 1200, the backend (base_stock - 1030) will calculate a target that ensures a replenishment order is emitted to meet actual consumer demand while carrying zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Massive pipeline failure confirmed. Total lost/overdue units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17) reached 815 units. P17 (450 units ordered in Period 17) is now 8 periods overdue. Parameters must be explicitly inflated to bypass these ghost units in the 'In-transit' logic.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), the supply chain is in a state of severe collapse. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1200 units is composed almost entirely of lost or severely overdue shipments: P1 (70), P3 (26), P4 (11), P13 (121), P14 (137), and P17 (450), totaling 815 units. These 815 units are 'ghosts' that block the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline). Only the orders from P24 (130) and P25 (170) are currently valid in the pipeline. Current demand has stabilized in a post-seasonal August regime; the mean demand over the last 8 periods (P18-P25) is approx 34 units. To force an order despite the 1200 units 'in-transit', I must set mu_hat to a value greater than the distorted pipeline. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1=3) at 34 units/period, I need a base stock of ~102. However, the backend sees 1200 units in transit. To trigger a replenishment of approximately 100-150 units to sustain operations through August, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1350 (distorted pipeline 1200 + desired stock 150) and sigma_hat to 100 to maintain a high service level given the supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed pipeline distortion remains at 815 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). August demand regime stabilized at ~34 units/period. Explicit parameter inflation remains necessary to bypass backend accounting of lost shipments.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (mid-August), the current demand for these skinny jeans has stabilized into a post-seasonal summer regime. Demand from Periods 18-26 has averaged 35.4 units per period. The primary operational challenge remains a massive distortion in 'In-transit' inventory. Based on the history, 815 units are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). The backend OR logic subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base level, which would prevent any new orders from being placed if parameters were set to reflect only the actual demand. To bypass these 815 ghost units and trigger replenishment, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L=2, plus current period) at ~36 units/period, which is 108 units. To this, I must add the 815 units of lost inventory to reach a threshold that forces the backend to order. Total mu_hat target is approx 1000. Sigma remains explicit to handle the variability seen during this stabilization phase without letting the backend's inherent calculation suppress the buy.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Pipeline distortion persists at 815 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). Post-seasonal demand (Aug) is stable at ~35-36 units/period. Explicit parameter inflation remains the only mechanism to ensure availability despite the backend pipeline error.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status: 108 units on hand. The 'In-transit' figure (1180 units) is extremely distorted by at least 815 units from historical lost batches (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17). Recent arrivals confirm that orders from P25 (170 units) arrived in 2 periods, while P24 (130 units), ordered earlier, is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. The current demand regime (mid-August) is stable, with the last 4 periods averaging 41.75 units. Due to the massive ghost pipeline (815 units + 130 potential new lost units), the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will prevent any orders from being placed unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated beyond the ghost volume. To ensure we maintain stock for the upcoming weeks while the system works through these distortions, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for approximately 4-5 weeks of coverage (mean ~42) and to bypass the 'In-transit' barrier.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Pipeline distortion increased to 945 units (815 previous + 130 from P24 confirmed 4 periods overdue). August demand regime mean is 41.75 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand has recently averaged 44.5 units over the last 4 periods (44, 62, 61, and current period's upcoming demand), showing a slight increase from the July stability of ~35. The pipeline is severely distorted by 945 units from lost or indefinitely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24). The backend OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' inventory (currently 1180 units) from its target base stock. Since 945 units are 'ghosts' that will never arrive, the backend will refuse to order unless the target base stock (mu_hat) is set high enough to exceed the inflated pipeline. I need to maintain a physical safety buffer for the next 3 periods (L+1). At a demand of ~45 units/period, I need about 135 units on hand + incoming. Since I only have 47 units and the next arrival (P26) is due next period, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger future orders if P26 also fails or to cover the gap between real demand and ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline distortion reaches 945 lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24). Average demand for August has increased to approximately 45 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), the SKU faces massive supply chain distortion. The backend reports 1180 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms at least 945 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24). Consequently, the actual functioning pipeline is only 235 units (P26=150 units plus any invisible arrivals), while on-hand inventory is critically low at 8 units. If the OR backend subtracts the reported 1180 units from any standard base stock, it will never place an order, resulting in permanent stockouts. To bypass this, I must set 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values that effectively neutralize the 1180 'ghost' units. Current demand regime for August (P26-P29) is ~51.5 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the actual required base stock (\u03bc + z\u03c3) would be approximately 155-180 units. By adding the 1180 units of distortion to this target, I set mu_hat at 1350 to ensure the backend logic produces a net order despite the pipeline error. I am using L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P25) adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain distortion remains critical; the 1180 units in 'In-transit' contain at least 945 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24). Demand for August/early September has stabilized at a mean of ~51.5 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1342 units is heavily inflated by at least 945 units from periods where shipments are long overdue and confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24). Specifically, P24 (130 units) is now 6 periods overdue, and P17 (450 units) is 13 periods overdue. Only P25 (170 units) arrived recently. We are currently out of stock. Demand for the most recent regime (P26-P30) is averaging 52.4 units per period (44, 62, 61, 39, 56). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1342 'In-transit' units, \u03bc\u0302 must be set high enough to exceed the perceived pipeline. Calculation: Target Base Stock > Pipeline + Demand. Given ~1342 in transit and ~53 demand, we need mu_hat to be approximately 1342 + (1+2)*53 = 1500 to trigger a meaningful order. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the backend's faulty pipeline logic and ensure replenishment for the current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Pipeline distortion increased to 1075 units (945 previous + 130 from P26 confirmed 5 periods overdue). Recent demand (P26-P30) mean has shifted upward to 52.4 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption. As of Period 32, the in-transit inventory of 1500 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost or severely overdue shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (70), P3 (26), P4 (11), P13 (121), P14 (137), P16 (ignored as part of arrival but potentially lost), P17 (450), P24 (130), and P26 (150) total 1245 units that are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods. The backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock to determine the order quantity. To ensure that new orders are actually placed to meet current demand, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values that are inflated to offset these 'ghost' units. Recent demand (P27-P31: 62, 61, 39, 56, 39) averages ~51.4 units/period. For a (1+L) coverage (3 periods), this is ~155 units. To bypass the 1245 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1400 (1245 + 155). This targets an order that accounts for the fact that nearly the entire visible pipeline is non-existent.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Pipeline distortion increased to 1245 units (1075 previous + 170 from P25/P26 status shifts). Total lost/overdue: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26. Recent demand mean (P27-P31) is 51.4 units/period. Explicit parameter inflation remains mandatory to trigger shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, the SKU 573937001 (jeans) shows a consistent demand regime. After a late summer peak, demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) has averaged 45.7 units/period. The key challenge remains the massive distortion in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. We have confirmed 1,245 units as lost or indefinitely delayed: P1(70), P3(26), P4(11), P13(121), P14(137), P17(450), P24(130), and P26(150), all of which are \u22654 periods overdue compared to the promised lead time of 2. Although 'In-transit' shows 1180 units, the actual functional pipeline is much smaller, consisting only of the recently received P30 and P31 orders and whatever was ordered in the interim (currently 0 in the history view for P32). With an on-hand inventory of 283 units and an average demand of ~46, we are covered for approximately 6 periods. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1180 'ghost' units and refusing to order when inventory eventually drops, I must continue to use explicit parameter inflation. Currently, with on-hand at 283 and a target base stock calculated via (1+L)*mu, I will set mu_hat to cover the on-hand plus a safety buffer, effectively 'overpowering' the pipeline logic if needed. However, given the high on-hand balance (283), no immediate order is required this period. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 6-period mean (45.7 * 3 = 137) but use explicit values to ensure the backend doesn't behave unpredictably due to the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 1,245 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26). Cumulative arrivals from P30 and P31 (320 units total) have stabilized on-hand inventory. Recent demand regime (P27-P32) mean is 45.7 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30), the inventory position is 203 units on-hand with 1,180 recorded as 'In-transit'. Based on history, at least 1,075 units in that pipeline are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26). The backend ignores these losses and assumes a massive surplus, which will suppress automated ordering. To prevent future stockouts, mu_hat must be set explicitly to a value higher than the 'ghost' pipeline but lower than the total in-transit to allow current on-hand to be consumed without triggering unnecessary costs. Recent demand (P27-P33) averages ~53 units/period. With a promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage needed), I set mu_hat to 1,280 (roughly 1,180 ghost units + 100 units coverage) and sigma_hat to 50 to maintain a small buffer. This effectively 'zeros out' the lost units in the logic while maintaining service levels for a seasonal product entering October.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative lost shipment distortion confirmed at 1,075 units minimum. Recent demand (Sept) is ~53 units/period, showing a slight increase from Aug (~45).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573937001 continues to face significant supply chain data distortion. The 'In-transit' figure of 1180 units is largely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26), totaling approximately 1075 confirmed lost units. These 'ghost units' prevent the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is over-saturated. Recent inventory arrivals from P30 and P31 provided a buffer, but with on-hand inventory at 152 and recent demand (Sept-Oct) averaging ~53 units/period (P31-P34: 39, 37, 80, 51), this stock will be depleted in approximately 3 periods. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, we must prepare to order soon. However, to 'force' the OR backend to order despite the 1180 units in transit, we continue to use 'explicit' methods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat at levels high enough to overcome the backend's (base_stock - pipeline) calculation. With on-hand=152 and demand ~53, we are currently safe for this specific period, so I will set mu_hat to a level that maintains current coverage without triggering an excessive order until the on-hand drops further, while still accounting for the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Pipeline distortion remains at ~1,075 lost units. Demand in late Sept/early Oct has stabilized at a higher regime of ~53 units/period compared to Aug (~42). On-hand inventory is currently sufficient for ~3 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the system maintains 102 units on-hand. Recent demand (P33-P35) has been 80, 51, and 50 units (average ~60.3 units/period), showing a slight upward trend compared to the August/September mean of ~45. The 'In-transit' figure of 1180 units remains critically distorted by approximately 1075 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26), which have not arrived despite being 4 to 34 periods overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1180 'pipeline' units from its base stock calculation, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated beyond the current distorted pipeline level. To maintain stock as on-hand inventory depletes (covering roughly 1.7 more periods of demand), I am setting mu_hat to 1350. This value accounts for (L+1) demand cycles (approx 180 units) plus the 1075 'lost' units to force the OR logic into ordering a replenishment of approximately 170 units (the cap).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Lost shipment distortion confirmed at 1,075 units minimum. Recent demand (Oct) has stabilized at ~60 units/period. Explicit mu_hat inflation remains necessary to bypass backend accounting of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573937001 continues to face massive pipeline distortion. There are at least 1,075 units confirmed as lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26), which inflates the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend. With a reported In-transit of 1,248 units and 1,075 units likely lost, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 173 units. On-hand inventory is 61 units, providing cover for ~1 period at current demand levels. Recent demand (P32-P36) has stabilized at a mean of 51.8 units/period. To trigger new orders despite the 1,075 'ghost' units in the pipeline, the mu_hat parameter must be explicitly set to exceed the current pipeline + desired base stock. I will set mu_hat to 1,300 to neutralize the 1,075 lost units and target a net base stock that covers approximately 3-4 periods of demand (approx 225 units net). This ensures the backend calculates an order rather than assuming we are overstocked.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573937001' is entering late October. Demand has stabilized over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) with a mean of 54.4 units/period, showing typical stability for basic denim. However, the system faces massive 'In-transit' distortion. There are approximately 1,248 units in-transit, but based on history, at least 1,075 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26 are all >4 periods overdue). Specifically, P17 (450 units) is now 21 periods overdue. Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (1,248) from the base stock, it will not place new orders unless the base stock is set higher than 1,248. Current on-hand is low (11 units). To trigger an order that actually arrives and maintains stock for the next 3 periods (L+1), I must set mu_hat explicitly to exceed the 'ghost' pipeline units plus the actual expected demand. A mu_hat of 1450 (approx 1250 pipeline + 200 demand) ensures the backend orders enough to replenish physical stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 1,075-1,200 lost units. Backend pipeline logic is completely decoupled from physical reality due to non-clearing lost orders. Explicit parameter inflation (mu_hat > 1250) is the only way to bypass the order cap and maintain on-hand inventory.

Since the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine orders, and current on-hand inventory is 0, no order will be placed unless the base stock parameter (mu_hat) is set higher than the distorted pipeline (1,439 units). Demand has entered a higher regime for November, averaging 54.5 units over the last 4 periods (P35-P38: 50, 41, 50, 67). To ensure an order is triggered to meet this demand, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the total in-transit units. Setting mu_hat to 1650 (approx. 1439 in-transit + 211 base-stock calculation for lead time + review period) forces the system to recognize a need for inventory despite the ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Pipeline distortion reaches 1439 units, with at least 1245 units confirmed lost (P1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 17, 24, 26). November demand regime mean is 54.5 units/period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face extreme disruption, with at least 1,245 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26) confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. As of Period 40, the 'In-transit' figure is 1,582, but 1,245 of those are ghost units that will likely never arrive. On-hand inventory is critical at 4 units. Period 39 demand was 64 units, and the current November regime averages ~65 units. To prevent a stockout, new orders must be placed. However, the OR backend's 'cap' and 'pipeline inventory' logic will block all orders if mu_hat is set to realistic levels (since 1,582 > 65 * 3). To bypass this and force an order that covers the immediate 3-period risk (approx 200 units), I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds the distorted pipeline volume. I am setting mu_hat to 1,850 to ensure an order of roughly 250-300 units is triggered despite the backend's perception of massive in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Pipeline distortion verified at 1,245 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26). November demand is stable around 64-65 units. On-hand inventory is near zero (4 units), requiring explicit parameter inflation (mu_hat > 1800) to bypass ghost inventory logic.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive supply chain failure with approximately 1,245 units confirmed lost in the pipeline (Orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 17, 24, 26). These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation, which naturally prevents the OR engine from ordering enough stock. Demand for November has stabilized at a higher regime (mean ~61 units/period over the last 3 periods). With 0 on-hand inventory as of Period 41 decision phase, and orders from P38 (191), P39 (211), and P40 (264) still pending, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' to force a new order. To trigger an order despite the 1,846 units 'In-transit', mu_hat is set to 2,200 to significantly exceed the ghost inventory and the backend's order cap logic. This ensures a safety buffer to recover on-hand inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Lost/ghost shipment distortion in pipeline confirmed at 1,245 units. Recent demand (Nov) stabilized at mean ~61 units/period. On-hand remains 0, necessitating massive mu_hat inflation to bypass 'In-transit' logic.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573937001 (Skinny HW Jeans) is currently facing a massive inventory reconciliation crisis. History shows that 1,245 units are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26). Because the OR backend counts these as 'In-transit', it perceives the pipeline as over-saturated and will block new orders unless parameters are explicitly inflated. Period 41 concluded with 166 units on-hand after P39's shipment arrived. Recent demand (P38-P41) has been 67, 64, 57, 45, averaging ~58 units per period. With a target service level and the need to 'drown out' the 1,245 ghost units in the pipeline logic, I must set mu_hat significantly high. The goal is to ensure the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' total (approx 1989 + 166 = 2155). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to force the OR backend to continue placing orders to cover actual demand of ~60 units/period despite the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 1,245 units. On-hand inventory recovered slightly (166 units) due to P39 arrival, but explicit parameter inflation remains necessary to bypass the backend's faulty in-transit accounting as subsequent orders from P40 and P41 are needed to maintain availability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand spiked significantly to 305 units, likely representing a Cyber Monday or early December holiday peak given the date (2019/11/25-12/02). This spike completely exhausted the 166 units that arrived from the Period 39 order. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' balance of 2,234 is still heavily distorted by cumulative lost shipments (approximately 1,245 units confirmed lost across P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26) and recently placed large orders (P40-P42) that have not arrived yet. Since the backend OR logic subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock target, it will effectively stop ordering unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed the distorted in-transit volume plus the desired on-hand target. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered for the current demand regime (averaging ~94 units over the last 5 periods including the spike) while fighting the ~1245 unit pipeline error, I must set an extremely high explicit mu_hat. I will target a mu_hat of 2500 to overcome the ghost units and the capped policy logic, facilitating arrival for the high-demand December period.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Period 42 (late Nov/early Dec) demand reached 305 units, significantly higher than the Nov average of ~61. Pipeline distortion remains fixed at minimum 1,245 units (P1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 17, 24, 26).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9). Demand has spiked significantly due to the holiday season (P42: 305 units, P43: 157 units), yielding a 2-week average of 231 units compared to the Nov average of ~61. On-hand inventory is 461 units, and the backend 'In-transit' figure is 1882 units. However, at least 1245 units in that pipeline are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26), meaning the 'real' pipeline is roughly 637 units (1882 - 1245). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this 1245-unit distortion, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory. Expected demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 600-700 units (anticipating sustained holiday demand). To bypass the 1245 ghost units and maintain safety stock, I set mu_hat explicitly to 2400. This calculation follows the logic: mu_hat > (Ghost Inventory + Expected Demand). Setting sigma_hat explicitly to 350 to account for high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: P42-P43 average demand is 231 units/period, a ~280% increase over the Nov baseline of 61. Real-world pipeline inventory is approximately 637 units, as 1245 units remain confirmed lost and un-cleared by the backend logic.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand in the last three periods (305, 157, 51) indicates a significant holiday spike in P42-43 followed by a sharp drop in P44. The average demand over these last three periods is approximately 171 units/period. Historically, the pipeline is heavily distorted by 1,245 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26) which remain in 'In-transit' indefinitely. Currently, 'In-transit' is 1939 units, but the functional pipeline is roughly 694 units (1939 - 1245). On-hand inventory is 410 units, which is sufficient for ~8 periods at the post-spike demand of 51, but only ~2.4 periods at the average three-period rate (171). Given the likely end of the holiday peak, I will set mu_hat using a 3-period average to account for the recent volatility while maintaining safety stock. To ensure an order is actually placed despite the 'ghost' units in-transit, I must inflate mu_hat to exceed the ghost pipeline (1245) + desired base stock. To trigger a replenishment of ~100-150 units, I set mu_hat to 1600.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike peaked in P42 (305 units) and P43 (157 units), with P44 (51 units) returning toward the pre-holiday baseline. Total pipeline distortion remains at 1,245 confirmed lost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-819.00

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 confirms that the holiday demand peak (P42, P43) has completely subsided, with demand in P44 and P45 returning to a baseline of 51 units. On-hand inventory is healthy at 870 units following the arrival of orders from P42 and P43 (511 units total). However, the chronic pipeline distortion is still present. There are 1,245 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26) confirmed lost that remain in the 'In-transit' calculation (visible in the 1428 total in-transit). To prevent the OR backend from stopping orders prematurely due to these 'ghost' units, I continue to use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I have lowered the mu_hat value from the holiday peak levels to 1425. This value is calculated as (L+1 * Forecast) + Lost_Units, specifically (3 * 60) + 1245. This ensures the base_stock (roughly 1425) stays at or slightly above the distorted pipeline level (1245 + recent orders), allowing the system to place small maintenance orders if needed while the on-hand stock is drawn down. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for potential late-December variability.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand return confirmed: P44-P45 demand is 51 units, significantly down from the P42-P43 average of 231. Pipeline distortion remains static at 1,245 confirmed lost units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'ED Madison Skinny HW' has returned to its post-holiday baseline, with Periods 44-46 showing stable demand of 51, 51, and 43 units (Mean ~48). Our current on-hand inventory is 827 units, which is significantly more than our expected demand for the next 3 periods (~144 units). The pipeline distortion remains a critical issue; while 'In-transit' shows 1,428 units, we know at least 1,245 of these (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P24, P26) are confirmed lost/overdue shipments that the backend still counts toward pipeline inventory. Because our on-hand inventory is currently high (827 units), and the return to baseline demand means we do not need to order immediately, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the recent post-holiday average. By not using the massive explicit inflation of previous periods, we allow the backend to see the high on-hand and high (distorted) in-transit levels, which will naturally result in zero new orders for this period, avoiding unnecessary holding costs while we burn through current stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand baseline confirmed: P44-P46 demand mean is 48.3 units/period. On-hand inventory (827) is sufficient for ~17 periods at this rate.
