Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge', a staple women's hosiery item. Initial on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand shows 5 samples (196, 255, 294, 212, 190) with a mean of 229.4 and a standard deviation of 45.4. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The backend OR engine uses the formula (1+L) * mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L) * std for sigma_hat. Using 'default' methods will correctly initialize based on all 5 available samples, providing a base stock that covers the 2-period lead time plus the current review period (total 3 periods of demand).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2 (2019/2/18), we analyze SKU 608776002 (Scallop 5p Socks). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows values of 196, 255, 294, 212, and 190. Period 1 demand was 233. The average demand across these 6 samples is 230. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (303 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (L=2). There was a stockout in Period 1 (sold 0 against demand 233) because we started with 0 inventory. To set parameters for Period 2, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all available demand history and 'default' for lead time and sigma. Since Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level base stock (q = 0.5), which is essentially the point estimate for demand over (L+1) periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge', a basic apparel item. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averages around 230 units/week. Recent demand in Period 1 (233) and Period 2 (271) is consistent with this baseline (overall mean ~ 235). Inventory status: On-hand is 0, and we have 599 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since the P1 order (303 units) was placed in Period 1, it is expected to arrive during Period 3 (this period) and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. There is no evidence yet that lead times have deviated from the promised 2 periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the slight uptick in the last two weeks while acknowledging the 5 historical samples provided. L is set to default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Scallop 5p Socks' is a basic item with high holding costs relative to profit (Ratio 1:1), requiring tight inventory control. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (303 units), P2 (296 units), and P3 (121 units) have not yet arrived. Following the 'Critical Timing Example', the P1 order should arrive during P3's Demand Resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message read at the start of P4. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since on-hand is 0 and we have lost sales in P1-P3, we are in a persistent stockout. Historical demand samples (last 5: 196, 255, 294, 212, 190) plus game history (233, 271, 174) show a mean of ~228. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and use recent_N=3 for mu/sigma to capture the actual sales environment (mean ~226). This will trigger the OR backend to calculate a base stock designed to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Fine-knit socks'. Historically, demand samples were around 190-290. Looking at the last 4 concluded periods, demand has been: 233, 271, 174, 145. There is a downward trend in the last two weeks, likely moving away from the peak winter/Valentine's period. We currently have 151 units on hand. The Period 1 order (303 units) is significantly overdue (promised lead time 2, now Period 5 and no arrival confirmation), suggesting it may be lost. The Period 2 order (296 units) arrived exactly on time in Period 4 (lead_time 2). The Period 3 (121) and Period 4 (184) orders are in transit. Because the Period 1 shipment is likely lost, I will maintain the default lead time (2) but use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand mean (avg ~205) and variance, ensuring the OR engine calculates a base stock that accounts for the likely loss of the 303 units without over-ordering if they happen to appear late.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Examining the history for SKU 608776002: Demand over the last 5 periods (233, 271, 174, 145, 162) shows a mean of 197. Demand has softened compared to the initial two periods but remains steady. Inventory is currently 0, with 608 units in transit. Specifically, orders from P1 (303 units), P3 (121 units), and P4 (184 units) are outstanding. The P2 order arrived in P4 (lead time = 2), confirming the promised lead time of 2. The P1 order is now significantly overdue (placed in P1, should have arrived in P3), suggesting it is likely lost. If we treat the P1 order as lost, our true pipeline is 305 units (P3+P4). With L=2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 600 units). I will use explicit values to account for the likely lost P1 shipment, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that triggers an order to fill the gap left by the missing 303 units while responding to the recent mean demand of ~190-200.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (303 units) likely lost: placed P1, overdue by 3 periods (expected P3). Lead time for P2 order confirmed as 2 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The historical demand for these 'Scallop 5p Socks' shows a slight downward trend: samples were high (190-294) in Jan/Feb, but the last three actual demand observations are 174, 145, 162, and 143 (average ~156). The P1 order of 303 units is essentially confirmed lost, as it's now 4 periods past its expected arrival (P3) and hasn't appeared in any 'conclude' message. The P2 order arrived in P4, confirming a lead time of 2. We are currently out of stock (on-hand 0). The pipeline (in-transit) consists of the P3 order (121), P4 order (184), and possibly the 'lost' P1 order (303). Since the OR engine is blind to losses, I will use 'explicit' L and mu_hat to signal that we need to replace the lost stock and account for the pipeline discrepancy. I'm setting L=2 (promised). Mu_hat will be set based on a forecast of ~160 units/period over (L+1)=3 periods, which equals 480. However, the backend subtracts pipeline. If the backend thinks 608 units are coming and I need 480, it won't order. By setting mu_hat explicitly high (or adjusting N), I force an order to compensate for the 303 lost units. Demand is stable around 160 per week, so I'll use N=5 for sigma to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: P1 order of 303 units confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed, lead time is 2). Demand regime stable at ~160 units/week since P3.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The context involves Women's socks (Scallop 5p Socks), which typically show stable demand after initial peaks. Looking at history, demand has settled since Period 3 into a stable regime (P3: 174, P4: 145, P5: 162, P6: 143, P7: 135), averaging approximately 152 units/week. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). The P1 order of 303 units is definitively lost (P8 and no arrival since P3/P4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 780 units in-transit (P3: 121, P4: 184, P7: 172, plus others not explicitly listed but totaling 780). Note that sold units were 0 for the last two periods due to 0 inventory, despite positive demand. I will set L=2 (default/promised). For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-peak stability (Avg ~152). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand for the lead time + review period. My parameters aim to recover from the stockout caused by the lost P1 and P5/P6 gaps.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Current on-hand is 0, with 608 units in-transit. Historic demand shows a clear shift: the first 3 periods (including pre-game samples) averaged ~240 units, but since Period 3, demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Calculating the mean since Period 3 (174, 145, 162, 143, 135, 182) gives ~157 units/week. Regarding lead times: the P1 order (303 units) is confirmed lost. The P2 order had a lead time of 2, while the P7 order arrived in just 1 period. For high service levels when profit=holding_cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock formula simplified to demand over (L+1) periods. Given the stockout for 4 of the last 5 periods due to the lost shipment and varying lead times, I will use a 6-period window to capture the current demand regime and stick to the promised lead time of 2 to ensure the backend computes a sufficient base stock to cover the 608 units already in-transit and replenish the on-hand gap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P2 order (L=2), P7 order (L=1). Demand regime definitively shifted at Period 3 to a lower mean of ~157 units/week.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 608 units in-transit. The 608 units in-transit are primarily composed of the lost Period 1 order (303 units), which the OR backend still accounts for in its pipeline inventory calculation because it hasn't arrived. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend targets a 50% service level. However, because it thinks the 303 lost units are coming, it will under-order unless the pipeline is managed. The actual demand regime shifted at Period 3; calculating since then, the mean demand is 144 units (excluding the outlier 65 in Period 9, which might be due to stockouts affecting behavior or true drop). I will use explicit values to account for the lost order: \u03bc\u0302 is set to (1+L) * 144 = 432. Since in-transit (608) > base_stock, the OR engine might not order. To force a replenishment order to cover the 303 missing units, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflecting the need for safety. Actually, to offset the 303 ghost units in 'in-transit', I must set \u03bc\u0302 significantly higher to ensure (\u03bc\u0302 + z\u03c3\u0302 - pipeline) triggers an order. Recent mean (P3-P9) is 144. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the lower-demand regime while maintaining the promised L=2.

Carry-over insight: Period 9 demand (65) is a significant outlier compared to the P3-P8 avg of 157; monitoring to see if this is a new regime or a reporting anomaly due to prolonged stockouts.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and has been for several periods, leading to lost sales. Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (P9: 65, P10: 59) compared to the P3-P8 average of ~157. This suggests a seasonal decline as we move into late spring (April) for 'Fine-knit socks/Womens Nightwear'. The carry-over insights confirm the P1 order was lost and lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods. The current pipeline (In-transit: 608) is high relative to recent demand; these units include orders that haven't concluded yet (likely from P3, P4, or other unlogged activity). Given the sharp drop in demand, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~62) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering while waiting for the existing pipeline to arrive. L=2 is maintained to stay conservative against the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 9: Average demand dropped from ~157 to ~62 units/week (-60%), likely following seasonal trends for nightwear accessories in late spring.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 (2019/4/29). The product is 'Scallop 5p Socks', which has faced significant stockouts. Carry-over insights confirm two major demand shifts: the first at Period 3 (down to ~160/week) and the second at Period 9 (down to ~60/week). The recent periods (P9-P11) show a stable low-demand regime with demand values: 65, 59, and 54 (mean = 59.3). Lead times have been volatile, with one lost shipment from P1 and observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, on-hand is 0, but there are 608 units in-transit (orders from P3 and P4 are long overdue and likely lost; however, the pipeline inventory logic in the OR backend includes all undelivered units). Given the significant drop in demand confirmed over the last three periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current regime (~60/week). I will keep L at default (promised = 2) to maintain a conservative estimate for requirements over (L+1)=3 weeks.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand has shifted significantly downward starting from Period 9, which aligns with seasonal patterns for 'Fine-knit socks/Womens Nightwear' as spring progresses into summer. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P9-P12) is 64 units/week, compared to the previous regime's average of ~157. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 608 units in-transit. Note: The P1 order (303 units) is confirmed lost, while the P3 (121) and P4 (184) orders are extremely overdue (over 8 periods) and are likely lost as well. The 'In-transit' figure of 608 units likely consists of these ghost shipments (303+121+184 = 608). Because the backend OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, these 'ghost' units will prevent any new orders from being placed unless we adjust parameters to account for the risk. However, since the current pipeline (608) significantly exceeds even a high estimate of required stock for the new demand regime (mu_hat for L=2 would be ~192), the OR engine will order 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 60-70% reduction in demand observed since early April.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Current date is 2019/5/13. The product is 'Fine-knit socks', which has seen a significant demand drop since Period 9 (late spring). The average demand from Period 9 to Period 13 is ~62 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 608 units (comprised of the lost Period 1 order of 303 units, the Period 3 order of 121 units, and the Period 4 order of 184 units). Since the promised lead time is 2, the P3 and P4 orders are extremely overdue (10+ periods) and must be considered lost along with the P1 order. Total pipeline inventory is effectively 0 for the backend logic if we want to trigger a new order. Given the low demand regime (avg 62) and a lead time (L) of 2, mu_hat (1+L) should be around 186. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed loss of Period 3 (121 units) and Period 4 (184 units) shipments; orders are overdue by 8+ periods. All 608 units currently in-transit are considered lost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The demand regime significantly shifted around Period 9 (early April), moving from an average of ~157 units/week to ~62 units/week, likely due to spring seasonality for fine-knit socks. Recent demand (P9-P14) has been 65, 59, 54, 78, 52, 61. The mean of these last 6 observations is 61.5. Pipeline inventory shows 608 units in-transit, but carry-over insights and history confirm these are all lost (P1: 303, P3: 121, P4: 184). On-hand inventory is 0. Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (608) to calculate orders, and it does not know these are lost, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory, or use the sigma_hat/L parameters to adjust. However, the most direct way to force an order when the backend thinks we have 608 units is to set mu_hat to cover the actual needed base stock plus the 'lost' units. Target Base Stock for (L+1=3) periods should be ~3 * 62 = 186. To overcome the 608 'in-transit', I set mu_hat explicitly to ~800 to ensure the backend places a fresh order for this new demand regime. I will use L=recent_N (N=2) to reflect the observed lead times of 2 and 1.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is Women's Fine-knit socks, which has shown a clear seasonal decline from a high of ~250 units in Jan/Feb to a new regime of ~60 units/week starting around Period 9 (April). Period 15 demand was 49, consistent with this lower regime. My inventory situation is critical: On-hand is 0, and the logic regarding 'In-transit' needs careful handling. Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (303 units), P3 (121 units), and P4 (184 units) are lost (total 608 units). The 'In-transit' shown as 800 units likely includes these lost shipments plus the new order of 192 units from Period 15. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (800) from the base stock, it will not order anything unless I use 'explicit' values or account for the lost stock. However, since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock = mu_hat. For the current regime (P9-P15), avg demand is ~60. With L=2, mu_hat should be ~180 (3 periods). Since pipeline (800) >> 180, the backend won't order regardless of the mu_hat I set unless I adjust for the losses. Given the game's constraints and the risk of massive holding costs if those 'lost' units suddenly arrived (unlikely but possible in OR simulation), I will stick to the 'recent_N' method for the lower demand regime and set L=2. I will use N=7 for mu_hat (P9-P15 regime) to capture the seasonal low accurately.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Scallop 5p Socks' is currently in a low-demand regime associated with the late spring/early summer season (May-June). Since Period 9 (2019/04/08), weekly demand has averaged approximately 57 units (ranging from 38 to 78), a significant drop from the early spring average of ~157 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit count is 800 units, but based on history, orders from P1 (303), P3 (121), and P4 (184) are considered lost (total 608 lost). The only viable order in the pipeline is the 192 units ordered in Period 15, which is expected to arrive in Period 17 (visible in Period 18) assuming a lead time of 2. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) based on the most recent 8 periods (P9-P16) to reflect the current low-demand regime (~57 units/week * (1+L)). Sigma_hat is calculated on the same window to capture recent volatility. I am using L=2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product (Fine-knit socks) is in a low-demand seasonal trough, with demand averaging ~53 units/week since Period 9. The most recent order from Period 15 arrived in Period 17 (lead_time=2), conforming to the promised lead time. We currently have 163 units on-hand. The 608 units 'in-transit' are confirmed lost (from Periods 1, 3, and 4), so the OR backend must be guided to ignore them. With demand hovering around 30-50 units and on-hand inventory at 163, we have approximately 3-4 weeks of stock. To prevent the OR engine from ordering against the ghost 'in-transit' inventory, I will set L to explicit 2 and mu_hat to a value reflecting the current low-demand regime (forecasted ~40/week * (1+2) = 120). Since on-hand (163) > mu_hat (120), the system should correctly place no new order while maintaining a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set using the last 9 periods (P9-P17) to capture current low volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). Demand has significantly cooled as we move into summer, reflecting the seasonal shift for 'Womens Nightwear Socks & Tights'. The demand regime shift identified at Period 9 (averaging ~62 units/week) has dropped even further in the last 4 periods (P15-P18: 49, 38, 29, 14), with the average now near 32 units/week. On-hand inventory is 149 units. Although 'In-transit' shows 608 units, these are from Periods 1, 3, and 4 and are confirmed lost (at least 15 periods overdue). One recent shipment (ordered P15) arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods. Given current on-hand inventory (149) and the very low recent demand (mean 32.5), we have approximately 4.5 periods of stock at current rates, which is more than sufficient for the (L+1) horizon. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this low summer demand and L to default since the recent arrival was on time. The backend will likely place no order due to the high on-hand balance relative to low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Summer slowdown confirmed, mean demand dropped from ~62 to ~32 units/week (-48%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20 (late June). The Carry-over Insights indicate a demand regime shift at Period 15, likely a summer slowdown for 'Fine-knit socks'. Demand from P15 to P19 has consistently decreased (49, 38, 29, 14, 25), with an average of approximately 31 units per week. This is a significant drop from the spring regime of ~62 units/week. On-hand inventory is 124 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 4 weeks. The 608 units in-transit are confirmed lost (ordered P1, P3, P4) and should be ignored by the OR backend. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~93 units). Since on-hand (124) already exceeds this, the OR backend will likely not place an order. I will use 'recent_5' to capture the current low-demand summer regime.

Since then, weekly demand has averaged approximately 23.2 units (49, 38, 29, 14, 25, 14). On-hand inventory is 110 units, which covers nearly 5 weeks of current demand at \u03bc \u2248 23. The 608 units in-transit are confirmed lost (from Periods 1, 3, and 4), so the OR backend should ignore them. However, since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are identical, the critical ratio q = 0.5, implying a target service level of 50%. The current on-hand inventory (110) already significantly exceeds the target base stock for this low-demand period (\u03bc * (L+1) = 23 * 3 = 69). To ensure the OR engine does not place an unnecessary order, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) of summer demand (P15-P20), and use 'explicit' lead time L=2 to reflect the promised/standard arrival time. Given the high inventory and high holding cost relative to profit, the backend will correctly skip ordering.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. We are in a summer demand slump for fine-knit socks. Since Period 15, the demand has significantly dropped, with a mean of ~25 units/week and decreasing trend (last three periods were 25, 14, 12). Current on-hand inventory is 98 units, which is approximately 4 weeks of supply at the current demand rate (~25/week). The in-transit inventory of 608 units consists of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which were confirmed lost in previous insights. Because profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)), implying the OR backend will target the median demand (captured by mu_hat). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent July demand levels (average ~16), which will prevent over-ordering while we deplete the excess on-hand stock. As on-hand (98) is greater than expected demand over the lead time (L+1), no new order will be triggered, which is correct given the current surplus and high holding costs.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product (fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge) is currently in a summer seasonal low. Historical demand since Period 15 confirms a significantly lower regime, with the last 5 periods (P18-P22) showing demand values of 14, 25, 14, 12, and 17, averaging 16.4 units/week. This follows the previous regime's average of ~62 units/week. Inventory is currently healthy at 81 units on-hand, which is sufficient for approximately 5 weeks of coverage given the current sales rate. The 608 units in-transit are confirmed lost from orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (now 18+ periods overdue). The OR backend's inventory calculation (on-hand + pipeline) will see 81 + 608 = 689 units. To prevent the OR logic from erroneously suppressing orders for the next 42 weeks due to these 'ghost' units, and to maintain a lean stock during this low-demand period, I will set mu_hat to a low explicit value to ensure the base_stock calculation remains reasonable, effectively bypassing the inflated pipeline inventory. I'll use N=8 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility within this low regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22 (Period 24). The product is 'Fine-knit Scallop Socks', which fits the 'Womens Nightwear/Socks' category. We are currently in a sustained low-demand 'summer slowdown' regime that began around Period 15. Demand for the last 9 periods (P15-P23) has averaged 23.55 units/week (49, 38, 29, 14, 25, 14, 12, 17, 14). Specifically, the last 6 periods (P18-P23) show an even lower mean of ~16 units/week. On-hand inventory is 67 units, which covers approximately 4 weeks of current demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 608 units consists of orders from P1, P3, and P4 that are long-confirmed as lost; therefore, the OR backend's inventory calculation (On-hand + In-transit) will be heavily skewed, seeing 675 units total. To prevent the OR engine from completely stopping orders if demand were to rise, or to ensure it calculates based on the correct regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=9, covering P15-P23) to reflect the summer demand. However, since On-hand (67) is much higher than (1+L)*mu (~3*16=48), the system will naturally not order more. L is set to 'calculate' as observed lead times (2, 1, 2) are stable around the promised 2.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Scallop 5p Socks) is in a summer low-demand regime. Since Period 15, demand has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 21 units/week (last 10 periods: 49, 38, 29, 14, 25, 14, 12, 17, 14, 28). Current on-hand inventory is 39 units, which covers nearly 2 weeks of current demand. Pipeline inventory (608 units) consists of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which are now 20+ periods overdue and confirmed lost in Carry-over Insights; however, the OR backend sees them as 'in-transit'. To prevent the backend from suppressing orders due to this 'ghost' pipeline, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N method (N=10) to capture the current low-demand regime. Lead time remains estimated at the promised 2 periods (L=recent arrived cases). No new orders are likely triggered as on-hand (39) > (1+L)*mean_demand (3*21=63 is not yet reached, but inventory is depleting), and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), necessitating lean inventory management.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26. The product is 'Fine-knit socks', which are seasonal, and we are in early August (summer). Carry-over insights confirm several regime shifts: the most recent occurred at Period 15, moving into a summer low-demand phase. Demand from Period 15 to 25 has averaged ~24 units per week (min 12, max 49). On-hand inventory is now 10 units. While 'In-transit' shows 608 units, these are documented in carry-over insights as lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4. The OR engine needs to place a new order to avoid a stockout in Period 27/28. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the last 11 samples (Period 15-25 regime) to capture the current mean demand (~24 units/week), and sigma_hat also based on these 11 samples to reflect current volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to calculate a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (~72 units) and place an order for ~62 units, ignoring the phantom in-transit stock since the backend cannot reconcile losses without these parameters.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (women's fine-knit socks) is currently in a summer demand regime (approx. 20 units/week). Period 26 saw a slight demand uptick (43 units), possibly indicating the start of an early autumn transition, though it's too early to confirm a sustained shift. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 608 units consists entirely of historical lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4; because the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, keeping these 'ghost' units in-transit prevents new orders from being placed. I will use 'explicit' methods to override this. Lead time is assumed at the promised 2 periods (L=2). Mu_hat is set to 90 (30 units/week * (1+L)) to cover the current demand plus a buffer for the observed slight increase. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for moderate volatility during seasonal transitions. This ensures the backend places a new order despite the 608 lost units in the pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19 (Period 28). The SKU is 'Scallop 5p Socks', which exhibits strong seasonal sensitivity. History shows a peak in late winter/early spring (~160-250 units/week), a drop in late spring (~60 units/week), and a trough in summer (~15-30 units/week). We are now entering late August, where demand has started to climb (P26: 43, P27: 58) as we approach the transition from summer products back to nightwear and hosiery. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 608 units 'in-transit' consist of lost shipments from periods 1, 3, and 4 (303+121+184), which have not arrived for over 20 periods and must be written off mentally to trigger a new order. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this immediate upward trend (avg ~43 units/week) and ensure the order covers the 2-period lead time plus current week demand. L is set to 'calculate' based on realized lead times of 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend started at Period 26: demand increased from summer mean (~20) to ~50 units/week (+150%) as late August transition begins.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 29 (late August). Demand history shows a clear recovery from the summer low (~20 units/week) beginning in Period 26. Demand for the last three periods (P26-P28) averaged 54.67 units/week (43, 58, 63). This aligns with the transition to autumn for 'Socks & Tights'. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 608 units is composed of ancient lost orders (P1, P3, P4) as documented in Carry-over Insights; they will never arrive. Lead time is generally stable at the promised 2 periods (last observed arrival P17 from P15). I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent recovery (forecast of 55 * (1+L) = 165) and sigma_hat using the last 4 samples (P25-P28) to capture the increased volatility during this trend shift. The goal is to trigger an order immediately to meet the rising autumn demand, as previous in-transit units are ghost inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 30 (2019/9/2). The product is 'Fine-knit socks with a scalloped edge', which typically sees a seasonal demand recovery in autumn. History confirms this: Period 26-29 demand (43, 58, 63, 40) marks a clear increase from the summer low (~20). The average for this new recovery period (P26-P29) is ~51 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 608 units consists of orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (303, 121, 184), which are now confirmed lost (all being >25 periods overdue). Because the OR backend subtracts the 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock, keeping these lost units in the pipeline prevents new orders. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force an order that accounts for the current demand recovery while ignoring the phantom pipeline. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use (1+L) * mean(P26-P29) = 3 * 51 = 153. To effectively clear the phantom pipeline and ensure an order is placed, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed 608. Given the high stockout risk during the fall season and the need to override the 608 units, I will set mu_hat to a level that forces the OR backend to order sufficient stock (forecast 51 * 3 periods + 608 lost units = 761).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). The 'Scallop 5p Socks' (Womens Nightwear/Socks) are entering the autumn ramp-up. We've seen a clear demand recovery trend starting around Period 26 (avg ~60 units/week), with the most recent demand hitting 92. The carry-over insights indicate significant historical order losses (P1, P3, P4) totaling 608 units. Currently, 'In-transit' is 761, which includes the 608 lost units and the 153 ordered in P30. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the 92+ demand levels, I must account for these lost units. I set L=2 (promised/recent observed). For mu_hat, I use an explicit value based on the latest demand (92) multiplied by (1+L), which is 92*3=276. This ensures the base stock is positioned correctly relative to real pipeline inventory (153) rather than the inflated figure (761).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Back-to-school demand surge confirmed at Period 30: demand reached 92, up ~84% from August mean (~50). Pipeline inventory still includes 608 units of stale, lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are seeing a sustained demand surge aligned with the autumn/back-to-school season for 'Womens Nightwear Socks'. Demand has risen to 116 units in Period 31, following 92 in Period 30, confirming a recovery from the summer lows. Pipeline inventory is currently 761 units, but 608 of these are from lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (303 + 121 + 184 = 608). Only the 153 units ordered in Period 30 are expected to arrive (likely in Period 32 or 33). To ensure we meet the current higher demand level (~100 units/week), I am using an explicit mu_hat based on the most recent 2-week average (approx 104 * (1+2) = 312). Since the OR backend uses the full pipeline inventory to calculate orders, I must use an explicit lead time (L) value of 8 to 'trap' the 608 lost units within the calculation. By setting L to 8, the backend's base stock (mu_hat) effectively covers 9 periods of demand (approx 936 units). With 761 in transit and 0 on hand, the order will be approx 936 - 761 = 175, which correctly covers the next cycle while accounting for the phantom inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (Sept 23) shows the product is in a sustained autumn growth phase. Demand has stabilized at a higher level (92, 116, 116 units in the last 3 periods), averaging ~108 units/week. This aligns with the 'back-to-school' surge noted in carry-over insights. Pipeline inventory (740 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 608 units), which have never arrived and are over 25 periods overdue. Therefore, effective pipeline is only 132 units (from P32). With an on-hand inventory of 37, total effective inventory (169 units) is insufficient to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the current average rate (~324 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new higher-demand regime while using an explicit lead time of 2 (the promised and most recently observed lead time) to ensure the OR engine orders enough to bridge the gap created by the stale lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued at ~116 units/week (Periods 31-32), confirming a stable autumn regime roughly 2x higher than the August mean.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' exploded in Period 33 (319 units), far exceeding the stable autumn plateau of ~116 observed in Periods 31-32. This spike is likely a late September surge related to colder weather or a specific marketing event. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline (740 units) is heavily contaminated by 608 units of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (leaving only 132 units of 'real' in-transit stock from P32), we must aggressively re-stock. The backend OR engine needs to see a high mu_hat to account for this new peak and to overcome the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 250 to reflect a weighted expectation between the 116 baseline and the 319 peak, and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for this massive volatility. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Demand surged to 319 units (+175% from previous plateau), signaling extreme autumn/winter volatility. Pipeline inventory (740) contains 608 units of confirmed lost shipments from Q1.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Fine-knit socks) is entering the peak autumn/winter season (October). Demand in the last two periods spiked significantly to 319 and 272 units, confirming a shift from the previous autumn plateau (~116). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported pipeline (750 units) is severely misleading because it includes 608 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are definitively lost. The only valid in-transit units are from Period 32 (132 units, expected P34-35) and Period 34 (10 units, expected P36). Period 32 should arrive this period (P35). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the new high-demand regime (+300 units/week), I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat at 900 (calculated as (1+L)*300 where L=2). Since the backend subtracts pipeline (750), this will trigger an order of 150 + 132 (backfill for lost units) = ~282 units plus safety stock, effectively compensating for the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33 confirmed: Autumn/Winter peak mean approx 300 units/week (based on P33: 319, P34: 272). Pipeline inventory contains 608 units of stale 'lost' shipments from Q1 which must be manually offset in base stock calculations.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36 (Oct 14th), demand remains high at 315, confirming the seasonal autumn/winter regime shift detected in Period 33 (avg ~300). Lead time is volatile (most recently 3 periods for the P32 order). The total in-transit stock is 768. However, 608 of these units are confirmed lost shipments from Q1 (P1: 303, P3: 121, P4: 184), meaning the 'real' pipeline is only 160 units (P34: 10, P35: 150). With actual lead time trending toward 3 periods, we need to cover at least (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~1200 units). The OR backend's base_stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) subtracts the full pipeline (768). To ensure an order is placed that reaches the required ~1200 units of protection, mu_hat must be set to compensate for the 608 phantom units: Target (1200) + Phantom (608) = 1808. We use 'explicit' to force this target and handle the stale inventory offset.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility increased: P32 order arrived in 3 periods instead of promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a sustained high-volume autumn/winter peak. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P33-P36) is approximately 295 units/week. Period 36 demand was 275. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory (1113 units) is misleading because it includes 608 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Effectively, the 'live' pipeline consists of the Period 34 order (10 units, overdue) and the Period 36 order (495 units). Lead time has been volatile, showing 3 periods (P32 order) and 1 period (P35 order) recently. To stay responsive to the high demand and account for 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover 3 periods of demand at the current high-regime mean (~295 * 3 = 885). Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (including the 608 lost units) from the base stock, I must set the base stock high enough to ensure a physical order is still generated. A mu_hat of 1493 (885 + 608) effectively offsets the lost units, ensuring the system aims for a real inventory position of ~885. Sigma is set high to account for the recent demand and lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains high: recent deliveries showed 3 periods (P32) followed by 1 period (P35). High-demand regime (mean ~295) confirmed for 4 consecutive periods (P33-P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '608776002' (Women's Scallop Edge Socks) is currently in its peak autumn/winter demand regime. Since Period 33 (late September), demand has consistently averaged ~305 units/week (P33: 319, P34: 272, P35: 315, P36: 275, P37: 345). The current date is October 28, nearing the winter shopping peak. Pipeline inventory (1493 units) is misleading because it includes 608 units of stale shipments from Period 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Effectively, the active pipeline consists of orders from P34 (10 units), P36 (495 units), and P37 (380 units), totaling 885 units. Lead times have shown volatility (recent observed: 3, 1), but the promised lead time of 2 remains a reasonable anchor. Setting L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time. mu_hat is set to roughly 915 units ((1+2) * 305) using the 'recent_N' method (N=5) to capture the stable high-demand regime established over the last five weeks. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to account for the current high variance during this seasonal peak.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the peak winter holiday season for socks. Demand has clearly intensified from a ~300 mean in October to 410 in Period 38. The high demand is sustained and likely to stay at or above the 400 unit/week level for the next several weeks. Pipeline inventory (1113 units) includes 608 units definitively lost from Q1 (Periods 1, 3, and 4), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is actually 505 units (consisting of orders from P34 and P36). Recent lead times have been volatile (3, 1, 1). I will set L to recent_N (N=3) to respect this volatility. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for the lost Q1 shipments: with a forecasted mean of 410 and L=2, base stock should be ~1230. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 1113 from its calculation, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by 608 to ensure the OR engine places an order that covers current demand despite the phantom inventory in the pipeline (1230 + 608 = 1838).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Demand reached 410 units, up 38% from the October mean of ~295, signaling the start of the holiday peak season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in the peak holiday season (mid-November), with demand for this 'Scallop 5p Socks' SKU showing high volatility and growth. The recent demand mean (P38-P39) has increased to ~388 units/week. Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting we should use a conservative lead time estimate of 2.5 to 3 periods for coverage. The 'In-transit' balance of 1315 units includes 608 units of stale, lost shipments from Q1 (P1, P3, P4) which have never arrived and are over 30 periods overdue. The actual viable pipeline is 1315 - 608 = 707 units (the orders from P37 and P39). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite these 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. With an expected lead time of 2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (Period 40, 41, 42). Using the recent holiday mean of ~388, 3 * 388 = 1164. However, to account for the 608 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available inventory, I must inflate the mu_hat by 608. Target mu_hat = 1164 + 608 = 1772.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak holiday demand period (November/December). Period 40 demand was 392, consistent with the holiday regime identified in Period 39 (mean ~400). Period 41 (Nov 18) and Period 42 (Nov 25) are expected to see sustained or increasing demand due to Black Friday and holiday shopping. The pipeline inventory (1642) currently includes 608 units of stale shipments from Period 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is 1642 - 608 = 1034 units. On-hand is 0. Lead time remains volatile (ranging from 1 to 3 periods); I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this variance. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the holiday peak mean (approx 390 units/week). Increasing sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to account for recent high demand volatility and lead time inconsistency, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level during this critical sales window.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand confirmed: Periods 38-40 show a mean of 389 units/week (+32% vs October). Effective pipeline inventory calculation must exclude 608 units of lost status-quo shipments.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25, entering the peak holiday season. Demand has been steadily climbing: P38 (410), P39 (365), P40 (392), P41 (438), with a 4-period mean of 401. This represents the high-demand regime identified in previous carry-over insights. Pipeline inventory management is complex due to 608 units of likely lost shipments from Q1 (P1: 303, P3: 121, P4: 184). Total in-transit is 945 units, but effective in-transit is 337 units (945 - 608), which is the P40 order of 327 plus a small adjustment from P34. Lead times have been volatile (1, 2, or 3 periods), but the recent P39 order arrived in 2 periods. To ensure stock availability through the holiday peak (L+1 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the ~400 units/week demand. Because profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0) by default; however, given high volatility and peak season risk, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to provide a buffer against demand spikes.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' has surged significantly entering late November (Period 42 demand: 682), confirming a pre-Christmas peak for the women's nightwear/accessory category. The mean demand for the holiday peak (P38-P42) has increased from ~400 to ~457 units/week. Lead times are currently fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using 'calculate' to capture this variability in the base stock. The pipeline inventory (945) includes 608 units of stale, lost shipments from early 2019 (P1, P3, P4). To account for this, since the backend uses (base_stock - pipeline), I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 608 'ghost' units. Current expected demand over (L+1=3) periods is approximately 457 * 3 = 1371. To ensure a delivery is triggered despite the 608 lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1371 + 608) = 1979.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand intensified further at Period 42: weekly demand jumped to 682 units (+75% from previous holiday mean). Adjusting forecast mean for the final holiday stretch to ~460 units/week.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final weeks of the holiday peak season (P44, Dec 9). Demand in P42 (682) was an extreme peak, while P43 (280) shows a post-Black Friday/Cyber Monday dip, common in retail. The average demand across these two volatile weeks is 481, which aligns with my previous holiday forecast of ~460. I will set mu_hat based on an explicit forecast of 480 units/week to ensure enough stock for the final two-week Christmas lead time. Pipeline inventory is currently 1489, but 608 units are confirmed lost shipments from Q1 (P1, P3, P4). The OR engine will subtract the full pipeline (1489) from the base stock. Therefore, I must set mu_hat to (1+L)*forecast + 608 to manually offset the lost units and trigger a correct replenishment order. Lead time remains volatile (averaging 2-3 periods), so I will use L=2 with an explicit mu_hat to cover the actual risk of 3-period arrivals observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand volatility: P42 peak (682) followed by P43 dip (280) gives a late-season mean of ~481 units/week. Lost shipments (608 units) still persist in pipeline inventory data.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (Dec 16), the final peak of the holiday season for socks. History shows demand intensified significantly around Period 42 (682 units). While demand cooled slightly to 280 and 299 in the two most recent periods, this is likely due to localized stockouts or mid-December fluctuations before the final Christmas rush. The mean of the holiday peak (P38-P44) is approximately 409 units/week. Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=2 (promised) as the calculation basis but maintain a high base stock to cushion against the frequent 3-period arrivals. Pipeline inventory currently shows 2001 units. However, 608 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost and must be excluded, leaving an effective pipeline of 1393 units (P43: 871, P44: 512). To ensure service levels for the final 2-3 periods of the simulation, I will set mu_hat to cover the holiday mean of ~450 units/period (accounting for potential final surge) and use a recent_N sigma to reflect high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: Holiday peak intensity increased mean demand to ~420 units/week despite recent stock-out affected readings. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must continue to subtract 608 units of lost status-quo shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), the peak of the holiday season. Historical analysis shows 420 demand in P45, despite stocking out in several previous periods. The holiday peak mean (P42-P45) is approximately 420 units/week. However, as we pass Christmas and head into the year-end/January transition, demand for 'Fine-knit socks' usually begins a seasonal deceleration. Since lead time is roughly 2.3 periods (averaging last 3 arrivals), we must cover demand for the next 3.3 periods. Current on-hand is 451. In-transit is significantly inflated by 608 units of lost status-quo shipments (P1, P3, P4). The actual useful pipeline is 522 units (the P44 order). Thus, effective inventory position is 451 (on-hand) + 512 (P44 order) = 963. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1100 (approx 365 mean * 3 periods) to account for the gradual post-holiday cool-down while maintaining safety stock. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to manage high late-season volatility. L is set to calculate to reflect the 2-3 period reality.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the post-holiday transition. Demand is cooling from the extreme holiday peak (observed P42-P46: 682, 280, 299, 420, 380: average ~412). However, stockouts in P42 and P44 likely suppressed the true demand level. As we move into January, demand for 'Scallop 5p Socks' (Womens Nightwear/Socks) often remains relatively high compared to summer, but will begin a downward trend from the December highs. The pipeline inventory (1130 units) still contains the 608 units of lost status-quo shipments from Q1 (P1, P3, P4), meaning the 'live' pipeline is 522 units (the order from P44). Lead times recently fluctuated between 2 and 3 periods; I will set L to 2 but maintain a high mu_hat to ensure we start the new year with sufficient coverage, while acknowledging the holiday peak has likely passed. mu_hat is set to roughly 400 * (1+2) = 1200 to cover the forecast mean for the review and lead time periods, effectively signaling the OR backend to maintain current levels while the large P44 shipment arrives.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand normalization: Late December mean demand approx 410 units/week, down from extreme late-November peak (682). Lost shipments of 608 units (P1, P3, P4) remain in pipeline status and must be mentally excluded from order logic.
