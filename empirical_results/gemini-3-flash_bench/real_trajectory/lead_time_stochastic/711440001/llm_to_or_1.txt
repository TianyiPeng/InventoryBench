Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-02-11. The historical demand for SKU 711440001 shows a stable baseline of approximately 11 units per week (Jan 7 to Jan 28), followed by a massive surge to 74 units on 2019-02-04. This product is a 'Wrapover top in jersey', a category that typically sees increased demand around Valentine's Day (Feb 14) and early spring transitions. The spike in the most recent historical sample (Feb 4) is a clear demand regime shift. Given the date (Feb 11) and the product type, I anticipate sustained higher demand for several weeks. Since on-hand inventory and in-transit units are currently 0, I must set parameters to bridge this gap immediately. I am using recent_N=1 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot entirely to the most recent high-demand signal (74 units), as the previous month's data (avg 11) is no longer seasonally relevant. L is set to 'default' (promised lead time of 2) as we have no evidence of lead time deviation yet.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected starting 2019-02-04 (from ~11 units to 74 units). Likely tied to seasonal Valentine's Day/Spring transition for women's tops.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (2019-02-11) confirmed a massive demand spike (98 units), which aligns with the carry-over insight of a seasonal surge for this 'Wrapover top' (Valentine's/Spring). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 93 units in-transit from the order placed in Period 1. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, these units are expected to arrive in the arrival phase of Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Since demand has shifted from an average of ~11 to ~86 (averaging the last two weeks: 74 and 98), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to project demand for the (L+1) horizon (3 weeks). I estimate weekly demand at 95 units to stay aggressive during this peak. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the recent high volatility. L remains 'default' (2 weeks) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: Average weekly demand moved from ~11 to ~86 units (+680%) starting Feb 2019.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand for this sweater (SKU 711440001) has seen a massive shift: from a baseline of ~11 units in January to an average of 93 units over the last three periods (74, 98, 107), confirming a seasonal demand regime shift likely related to the Spring/Valentine's transition. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 216 units in transit (93 units ordered in P1, 123 units ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the P3 conclusion. This means we are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0 in P1 and P2). To stabilize, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) which reflects the new high-demand regime (~93 units/week). L remains at the promised 2. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility of the spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand for Feb 2019 is 93 units/week, up from 11 units/week in Jan (+745%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are experiencing a severe stockout because demand shifted from ~11 units (January) to an average of ~93 units (February), but the stock has not arrived. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (Feb 11) were expected to arrive in P3's conclusion, but P3 conclude reports arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the P1 shipment is delayed. Since we have zero on-hand and 279 units in-transit (P1: 93, P2: 123, P3: 63), and aggregate demand remains high (last four weeks: 74, 98, 107, 81), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay. mu_hat will use the recent_N method with N=4 to capture the high-demand regime (avg = 90). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay observed: Order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude (Feb 25), indicating L >= 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. Historical demand shifted from ~11 units (Jan) to ~93 units (Feb), likely due to seasonal interest in the 'Emerald Wrapover top'. The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), but the Period 1 order (93 units) is conspicuously absent as of Period 4 conclude (should have arrived in P3 for L=2 or P4 for L=3). This missing P1 order is likely lost. Demand in Period 4 dropped to 67 units, suggesting the intense Feb peak is tapering. With 56 units on-hand and 237 in-transit (P1:93, P3:63, P4:81), we must account for the high probability that the P1 units (93) are lost. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) as that was the most recent observed arrival, and use 'recent_N' (N=4) for mu_hat to average the Feb/March high-demand regime (avg ~88) while acknowledging the slight downward trend. The OR engine will subtract the full pipeline (237) from the base stock. By maintaining a high mu_hat and sigma_hat, I ensure the engine places orders despite the inflated (potentially lost) pipeline count to prevent a stockout.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (93 units) is likely lost; it has not arrived by Period 4 conclude (Period 2 shipment arrived first). Demand is beginning to stabilize/taper post-February spike (67 units in P4 vs ~93 in Feb).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/03/18), the Emerald Wrapover Sweater is entering its post-February peak phase. Demand has trended downwards from a February average of ~93 to 44 units in Period 5, confirming the seasonal taper noted in previous insights. Regarding supply, the Period 1 order (93 units) is officially categorized as a lost shipment because the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2) and the Period 1 order has still not appeared by Period 5 conclude. There is a total of 237 units currently in-transit (Orders from P3 and P4). Current on-hand is low (12). Given the demand decrease, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent decline (81, 67, 44) rather than the earlier peaks. I will use the promised lead time L=2 for calculations, as the P2 order arrived on time, suggesting P1 was an isolated loss rather than a systemic lead-time shift.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand decay confirmed: Demand dropped from ~93 (Feb avg) to 44 units by March Period 5 (-52%). Period 1 shipment (93 units) is confirmed lost as later orders have arrived/concluded.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing history: Demand for this 'Jersey Fancy Wrapover top' peaked in February (avg ~95) and has significantly cooled in March (avg ~55). The Period 1 order (93 units) is confirmed lost as orders from Period 2 and later have either arrived or are in the pipeline while P1 remains 'In-transit'. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 6 where we only sold 12 of 55 units demanded. There are 237 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and potentially P5/P6 if any were placed, though history shows 0 ordered in P5/P6). Given the promised lead time L=2, the Period 3 order (63 units) should arrive during Period 7 (visible in Period 8's conclusion). Since demand has stabilized significantly lower than the February peak, I will use recent_N (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the post-peak March average (~55 units/week) rather than the volatile February data. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed history (P2 arrived in 2 periods), while accounting for the lost P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: March demand regime stabilized: Average demand dropped from ~93 (Feb) to ~55 (March) - a 40% reduction post-peak.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (women's wrapover sweater) has moved past its February seasonal peak (~93 units/week) into a lower March/April regime (~52 units/week). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the P1 order (93 units) is confirmed lost since P2, P3, and subsequent orders should have arrived. With in-transit at 237 units (representing orders from P3 and P4), we expect arrivals soon based on the confirmed 2-period lead time seen in P4. Demand has stabilized over the last 3 periods (P5-P7) around 47 units/week. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining the default lead time (L=2) now that it has been proven stable for successful deliveries. High sigma reflects recent demand volatility during the regime shift.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8, 2019. This SKU (Womens Sweater/Wrapover top) experienced a significant demand spike in February (avg ~93) which tapered off in March (avg ~55). The demand in Period 8 was 65, suggesting a stabilization in the 50-65 range for the spring season. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0, and there have been multiple stockouts due to a lost shipment (Period 1) and lack of orders in Periods 5-8. Total in-transit is 237 units, comprising recent orders. Based on the history, actual lead time for the successful delivery was 2 periods (ordered P2, arrived start of P4). Therefore L=2 is the correct expectation. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5: Periods 4-8) to capture the post-peak demand regime (mean ~55), and sigma_hat using the same window to address recent volatility. My goal is to trigger the OR backend to restore on-hand inventory levels to meet this stabilized spring demand.

Carry-over insight: April demand stabilization: Post-February peak, demand has settled into a 50-65 units/week range (avg ~55) for the Spring period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the demand for the jersey wrapover top has settled into a post-peak spring regime. The average demand since the start of March (Period 4) is approximately 51 units/week (67, 44, 55, 44, 65, 32). The outlier in February (approx. 95 units/week) has passed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 237 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent orders from Periods 1 (confirmed lost 93 units), 3 (63 units), and 4 (81 units). Wait, cross-referencing history: P2 arrived in P4. Total ordered in P1-P4 was 93+123+63+81=360. Arrived: 123. Remaining in-transit: 237. Lead time for the only successful arrival (P2) was 2 periods. The P1 order is definitely lost. The P3 and P4 orders (63+81=144 units) are significantly overdue (6-7 periods since ordering), suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. To recover from 0 on-hand inventory while accounting for the high probability of lost shipments, I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the observed Spring average (~51 units) over (L+1) periods, and use the 'explicit' method for L to maintain the promised lead time of 2 while the OR engine calculates the order. I won't rely on the 'in-transit' 237 units because they are likely lost; by setting a higher mu_hat or sigma_hat, I help trigger a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime (March-mid April) stabilized at ~51 units/week. Shipments from Period 3 and Period 4 (144 units total) are potentially lost as they are 5+ periods overdue beyond the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Demand for this jersey wrapover top has transitioned from its February peak (~93 units/week) into a post-peak Spring regime. The last four periods (P7-P10) show a declining trend (44, 65, 32, 24), with an average of 41.25 units/week. However, the last two weeks (32, 24) suggest a further drop as we leave the mid-Spring window. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent cooling trend while acknowledging the previous higher demand. Regarding inventory: On-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 237 units. Specifically, orders from P1 (93 units), P3 (63 units), and P4 (81 units) totaling 237 units are significantly overdue. Given that the P2 order arrived on time (2-period lead time), these specific shipments are likely lost. The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock; if I leave 'In-transit' at 237, it will order nothing. To force an order and bridge the current stockout (on-hand=0), I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat = (1+L) * (average of last 4 periods) + Lost Inventory. Calculation: L=2, (1+2)*41.25 = 123.75. To offset the 237 units of 'ghost' inventory in transit, I set mu_hat to 123.75 + 237 \u2248 361. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an actual order for roughly ~124 units (covering the next 3 weeks).

Carry-over insight: Demand decay quantified: Demand dropped 42% from early Spring average (~55) to late April average (~32).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are seeing a consistent decline in demand for the jersey wrapover top as the peak spring season (Feb-March) has passed. The last three demand observations are 32, 24, and 24, indicating a new regime averaging ~27 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory stands at 361 units, comprising orders from Period 1 (93), Period 3 (63), Period 4 (81), and Period 11 (124). History shows the Period 1 order is 11 periods old and essentially confirmed lost; Period 3 and 4 orders are also 8-9 periods old and likely lost. The only reliable in-transit volume is the 124 units from Period 11, expected to arrive around Period 13-14 (due to the 2-period promised lead time). Because pipeline inventory (including lost units) is so high (361), the OR engine will likely order 0. To ensure we have enough stock for the current lower demand level after Period 11's arrival, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent drop (avg ~27). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-period lead time from Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Late Spring demand regime (late April) confirmed: Demand dropped to ~27 units/week, a 50% decrease from the early Spring average of 55.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of 2019-05-06, we are in the late Spring period for this jersey wrapover top. Demand has significantly decelerated from the February peak (~93 units/week) and the early Spring stabilization (~55 units/week) to a new low-level regime. The last three periods (P10-P12) show demand of 24, 24, and 22 units, indicating a stable demand of approximately 23-24 units/week. Inventory is currently zero, with 361 units in-transit. However, the in-transit pipeline includes several likely lost shipments: P1 (93 units), P3 (63 units), and P4 (81 units), totaling 237 units that are significantly overdue. Subtracting these from the total in-transit (361 - 237) leaves 124 units (ordered in P11) which are expected to arrive in P13 or P14. Since 124 units cover over 5 weeks of current demand (~23/week), and we are entering May where demand for this specific long-sleeved 'Jersey Fancy' item likely continues to decline, no new order is necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current 3-period regime (~23 units/week * 3 periods) and keep lead time at the promised 2 periods to assist the OR backend's capped policy calculation.

Carry-over insight: Late Spring demand floor established: Demand has stabilized at ~23 units/week (Periods 10-12), down 58% from the March average.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Emerald Wrapover top) is currently in a late-spring demand trough. Demand has stabilized over the last four periods (Periods 10-13) with values of 24, 24, 22, and 22, averaging 23 units/week. This represents a 58% decline from the March average (55), confirming the 'Late Spring demand floor' mentioned in Carry-over Insights. Inventory management is now the priority to avoid excessive holding costs in a low-demand period. On-hand inventory is 102 units, which covers over 4 weeks of demand at the current rate (23/week). Additionally, there are 237 units in-transit. While 156 of those units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are highly likely lost given they are 10+ weeks overdue, 81 units from Period 4 are still technically in the pipeline, and the on-hand stock alone is sufficient for the immediate (L+1) horizon. Therefore, the OR parameters are set to reflect this lower demand regime: L is set to calculated (confirmed at 2 periods recently), and mu_hat uses the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current stable floor of ~23/week, which results in a base stock level that prevents new orders while on-hand stock remains high.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Emerald Jersey Wrapover Top) is in Period 15 (May 20). Demand has recently trended downward from early Spring peaks, stabilizing around 20-30 units, though Period 14 saw a slight uptick to 40. The current on-hand inventory is 62 units. There is a significant amount 'In-transit' (237 units), but historical evidence suggests much of this is lost. Specifically, orders from Period 1 (93 units), Period 2 (partially arrived), Period 3 (63 units), and Period 4 (81 units) are long overdue. The only recent successful delivery was the Period 11 order which arrived in Period 13 (L=2). To avoid over-ordering due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current lower demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the May stabilization (approx 27 units/week) and keeping L at the promised 2 periods, as the most recent successful shipment adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: May demand regime stabilization: Average demand for the last 4 periods is ~27 units/week, representing a 50% decrease from the March/April 'Spring' average (~55).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a jersey wrapover top, which saw a significant peak in February and March and has since entered a low-demand late-Spring/early-Summer regime. The last 5 periods (P11-P15) show demand values of 24, 22, 22, 40, and 25, averaging ~26.6 units/week. This demonstrates a stable, lower plateau compared to the March average of 55 units. On-hand inventory is 37, and in-transit is 237 units. However, I must reconcile the pipeline: Orders from P1 (93 units), P2 (123 units arrived), P3 (63 units), and P4 (81 units) totaling 237 units remain in the 'In-transit' accounting. As per carry-over insights, P1, P3, and P4 orders (totaling 237 units) are highly likely lost, as they are now 11+ periods overdue. Only the P11 order arrived successfully in P13. Given the Lead Time is confirmed at 2 periods when shipments actually arrive, I will use L=2. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the current stabilized regime of ~27 units/week) to calculate (1+L) * mean. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current low volatility. Since profit = holding cost ($1.00), the backend will aim for a 50% service level base stock, which is appropriate given the high stock-out risk from lost shipments vs. high pipeline inventory bloat.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Jersey Wrapover top) has transitioned from a high-spring peak (Feb-March) to a late-spring/early-summer low. Recent demand (Periods 15-16) showed 25 and 9 units, suggesting the May average of ~27 units/week is further decaying as we enter June. The average demand of the last 4 periods is 24 units. On-hand inventory is 28 units, which covers over 1 period of current demand. However, there is a massive 'In-transit' pipeline of 237 units. Based on history, the orders from Period 1 (93 units), Period 3 (63 units), and Period 4 (81 units) are long overdue (13, 11, and 10 periods respectively) and must be considered lost shipments. Excluding these losses, the actual reliable pipeline is essentially 0. Given the low demand regime and high holding cost relative to profit (1:1), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent stabilized low demand (approx 24 units/week) and use explicit parameters to avoid over-ordering while the OR backend reconcile the on-hand stock and 'z' factor. Recent volatility is also lower, so sigma_hat is adjusted accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand regime shift: Demand has dropped to ~17 units/week (avg of last 2 periods), a 37% decrease from the May average of 27.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand for this wrapover jersey top has significantly decayed since the February/March peak (avg ~93 units) and the April/May spring levels (avg ~27 units). The last two periods show demand at 9 and 15 units respectively (avg ~12), signaling an early summer low. On-hand inventory is 13 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 237 units includes several severely overdue shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 237 units: 93+63+81) which are likely lost. However, there are no newer shipments in the pipeline to replace them if they truly are gone. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which results in a low 50% service level target, I must avoid overstocking. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current late-spring/early-summer demand of ~23 units/week (Periods 14-17: 40, 25, 9, 15). Lead time (L) remains 2 periods based on concluded shipments (Period 11 arrived in 2 periods). No additional 'loss' adjustment is made to L yet, as it would trigger a larger order, which we want to avoid given high current pipeline and low demand.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand floor detected: Average demand for the last four periods (mid-May to early June) has dropped to 22 units/week, down from the May average of 27.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved jersey wrapover top, which is seeing a seasonal decline in demand as summer begins. Demand over the last 4 periods has averaged 15.25 units/week (P15-P18: 25, 9, 15, 12), significantly lower than the May average of 27. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). However, 'In-transit' shows 237 units, which consists of likely lost orders from Period 1 (93 units), Period 3 (63 units), and Period 4 (81 units). Even after accounting for these lost units, the pipeline technically holds substantial volume if any late shipments arrive. Given the current low demand regime (~15 units/week), I am using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent summer decay. I am keeping L as 'calculate' as lead times for successful deliveries (P2, P11) have consistently been 2 periods, while the lost orders skew the perception of lead time. The OR backend will see the high pipeline (237 units) and likely not place a new order, which is correct given the stock levels and low current demand.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand regime confirmed: Average demand has settled at ~15 units/week (Periods 15-18), a 44% decrease from the May average of 27.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Womens Jersey Wrapover Top) is in a mid-summer demand trough. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is approximately 12 units/week (9, 15, 12, 12), confirming the mid-June demand floor. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory of 237 units likely includes several lost or severely delayed historic shipments from February/March (specifically P1, P3, and P4 total 237 units, aligning with the reported figure), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. However, since the OR engine calculates base_stock - pipeline_inventory and the system reports an in-transit value of 237, the engine may refrain from ordering even if mu_hat is set appropriately. To force an order to meet the current demand regime (~12 units/week), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to low summer levels. For mu_hat, I use (1+L) * 12 = 3 * 12 = 36. For sigma_hat, I use sqrt(3) * std_dev(9,15,12,12) \u2248 4. These parameters target a lean stock position suitable for the current low-demand summer phase while accounting for the high reported (likely ghost) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-June demand regime confirmed: weekly demand has stabilized at ~12 units/week, down from May's 27 units/week (-55%). In-transit inventory of 237 units consists entirely of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of 2019-07-01, we are in a low-demand summer phase for this wrapover top. Current weekly demand has stabilized at approximately 10-12 units, significantly lower than the February peak (~93) and the May average (~27). The On-hand inventory is 0, and the In-transit figure of 237 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Period 1 (93 units), Period 3 (63 units), and Period 4 (81 units), which are now between 16 and 19 periods overdue. Since these shipments will never arrive, they must be excluded from pipeline inventory calculations. Given the 2-period promised lead time and the current demand of ~10 units/week, we need to order for a (L+1) horizon, meaning we need to cover roughly 30 units of demand (3 weeks * 10 units). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the stable mid-summer demand of approximately 11 units. I am setting L to explicit 2 to ensure the backend logic functions correctly despite the ghost 'in-transit' units, effectively forcing an order to replenish stock for the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: July demand floor established: Demand has stabilized at ~10 units/week (last 2 periods), representing a 63% decrease from May's average of 27.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a low-demand summer phase (Mid-July), with demand stabilizing around 8-10 units per week over the last two periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 237 units is comprised entirely of lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (Feb/March), which have not arrived in over 15 periods. Since the OR backend uses pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, these phantom units will prevent new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock for the current period. Current demand is ~9 units/week. Lead time is 2 periods. Total demand needed to cover L+1 (3 periods) is 27. I will set mu_hat significantly higher than the 237 lost units to trigger a small replenishment order that restores on-hand inventory, which has been at zero for three periods.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime further stabilized: demand has reached a summer trough of ~9 units/week (Periods 19-21), a 66% decrease from the May average of 27.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's jersey wrapover top) is currently in a low-demand summer trough, with the most recent demand sample dropping to 4 units. Historical data and carry-over insights confirm a sustained downward trend from a peak in February (~93) to a stabilized July level of approximately 4-8 units/week. Over the last 4 periods (P19-P22), demand has averaged (12+9+8+4)/4 = 8.25 units. I set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent low-demand regime (July trough). Lead time remains at the promised 2 periods (L=2) based on successful arrivals in P4 and P13. The in-transit inventory of 264 units is composed of the recent P22 order (27 units) and 237 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend deducts the 'pipeline' from the base stock, and it cannot distinguish between 'live' orders and 'lost' ones, the presence of 237 lost units in the pipeline would prevent it from ordering. I use mu_hat 'explicit' to override the base stock calculation, setting it to (1+L) * 8.25 \u2248 25 units. This ensures a target inventory of roughly 3 weeks of demand, even though the OR backend's cap may limit immediate ordering if it believes the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: July demand trough deepened: most recent sample (P22) dropped to 4 units, bringing the 4-period average down to ~8 units/week, a 50% drop from the June average (~15).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved 'Wrapover top in jersey', which is seasonally less relevant during the summer. We are currently in a deep demand trough, with the last two periods showing demand of only 4 units each. The 'July demand trough' identified in the carry-over insights is clearly visible in the data. The shipment from P22 arrived in Period 23 with an actual lead time of 1 period, which is faster than the promised 2 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 23 units, which is sufficient to cover more than 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~4-5 units/week). The in-transit inventory of 237 units is composed of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 and should be ignored for logic purposes. Given high on-hand inventory relative to the current low demand regime, I will set mu_hat conservatively using the last 4 periods (P20-P23: 9, 8, 4, 4) to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal trough.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time recently observed as 1 period (P22 order arrived P23). Demand trough confirmed: July weekly demand has dropped to 4 units (Periods 22-23), a further 50% decrease from the early July average (~8).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Womens Jersey Wrapover Top) is in a deep summer trough, with demand dropping significantly from its February retail peak (~93 units/week) to a current stable range of 4-5 units/week in July. The last three periods show demand of 4, 4, and 5 units. The actual lead time for the most recent replenishment (ordered Period 22) was 1 period, faster than the promised 2. On-hand inventory is currently 18 units, which covers approximately 3.6 weeks of demand at the current rate (average 5/week). The 'In-transit' quantity of 237 units consists entirely of lost shipments from periods 1 (93), 3 (63), and 4 (81), as documented in carry-over insights; these are ignored for decision-making. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the target service level is 50%, effectively matching the mean demand. With 18 units on hand and a demand forecast of ~5 units/week, we have sufficient safety stock for the lead time and review period (total 2 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent stagnant demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the actual performance.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-05. Demand has entered a summer trough for this long-sleeved jersey wrapover top; the last four periods (P22-P25) recorded demands of 4, 4, 5, and 18, with the jump to 18 in P25 potentially signaling the very early beginning of late-summer/pre-fall interest. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory of 237 units consists of orders from P1 (93), P3 (63), and P4 (81), all of which are significantly overdue (18+ periods) and are confirmed lost per previous carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is effectively 0. The observed lead time recently shifted to 1 period (P22 order arrived in P23). Given the service level objective (profit=1, holding=1, so a 50% critical ratio) and the low but potentially rising demand, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period average (~8 units/week) to capture the base demand without over-ordering on a single high data point (18). I will set L to 1 based on the most recent successful delivery.

Carry-over insight: August transition detected: demand increased from stable trough of 4-5 units/week to 18 units in Period 25 (+260%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey wrap-top, showing clear seasonal transition patterns. After a deep summer trough (4-5 units/week in July), demand is spiking as we move into August (18 units in P25, 30 units in P26). This likely signals a transition to late summer/pre-fall shopping. Demand has increased by 150%+ over the last two weeks. I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this upward momentum while keeping sigma_hat responsive to the new volatility. On-hand is currently 0, and the 237 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4, which the OR backend still calculates as pipeline inventory. Because the OR engine subtracts 'in-transit' from 'base_stock', and 237 units is significantly higher than any conceivable base_stock for current demand, the engine will order 0 unless I compensate. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it high enough to overcome the phantom pipeline and trigger an order that covers the current demand trend (approx 35-40 units/week) for the lead time (L+1=3).

Carry-over insight: August transition confirmed: Demand rose from 4-5 units/week (July) to 30 units/week by start of August (+500%), signaling pre-fall seasonality.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-August (2019-08-19). Historical data and product description (sweater/long-sleeve wrap top) indicate a strong seasonal transition for late summer/early fall. Demand has surged from a July trough of ~4 units/week to 18 (P25), 30 (P26), and 64 (P27). This represents a clear upward trajectory (average of last 3 periods is ~37, but the growth is exponential). The late-August demand is likely to continue rising towards the levels seen in Feb/March (~50-90 units). Inventory is currently critical: on-hand is 0, and the in-transit total of 350 includes significant legacy losses (P1, P3, P4 total 237 units). Recent lead time observed was 1 period (P23), but promised is 2; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend resolve arrival timing while accounting for recent variability. For mu_hat, I will use an explicit forecast of 75 units/week to anticipate the continued pre-fall surge, as 'recent_N' would lag behind the current rapid growth. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the high volatility of this seasonal ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall seasonal surge confirmed: Demand rose from 4 to 64 units/week over 4 periods (+1500%) starting late July/early August, mirroring the early Spring pattern for this long-sleeve item.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Emerald Wrapover Top (long-sleeved sweater item) has entered a significant pre-fall surge, rising from a trough of 4 units to over 60 units in the last two periods (avg ~63). This mirrors the Spring transition seen in February. Current on-hand is 0, and although in-transit is 350, 237 units of this are confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (orders placed in Feb/Mar never arrived). The only active valid shipment is 113 units from Period 27 (expected to arrive in Period 29 or 30). With demand rapidly increasing, I need to set mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (63 units/week) to ensure the base stock formula covers the lead time plus one period (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P23) showed a lead time of 1, though promised is 2.

Carry-over insight: Pre-fall seasonal surge confirmed: Demand rose from 4 to ~63 units/week (+1475%) over the last 5 periods (late July to late August), confirming seasonal relevance for this long-sleeve sweater item.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (long-sleeve jersey top) is entering its peak autumn season. Demand has surged from a July trough of 4 units to a current average of ~64 units over the last 3 periods (P27-P29). We are currently out of stock (0 on-hand) and demand is high (67 units in P29). While the current in-transit inventory is 350 units, much of this is legacy 'lost' stock (estimated 237 units from P1, P3, and P4 based on previous carry-over insights). The only reliable active shipment is 113 units from P27, which is expected to arrive in Period 29 conclude (visible P30 start) or Period 30 conclude. Given the growth pattern similar to the February spike (~90-100 units), I will set mu_hat to expect ~80 units per week over the lead time (1+2=3 periods) to ensure we recover from the stockout and meet seasonal peak demand. L is set to 'calculate' to utilize the most recent arrival data (which showed one instance of 1-period LT, but promised is 2).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand stabilized at ~64 units/week (Periods 27-29), a 1500% increase from summer trough. Active pipeline inventory alert: Total in-transit of 350 units contains ~237 units of confirmed lost legacy shipments.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Emerald Wrapover Top has surged significantly as we enter September, with Period 30 showing a massive leap to 131 units, doubling the already high August average of ~64 units. This aligns with the 'Autumn peak' and pre-fall seasonality for long-sleeve knitwear. The lead time for the most recent order (P27) was 3 periods, confirming that L=3 is a safer estimate for the current operational environment. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). Furthermore, the in-transit figure includes 237 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are clearly lost. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock for the next (L+1) = 4 periods of peak demand (averaging ~130 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 520 (4 periods * 130 units). sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 40 * sqrt(4)) to account for the high volatility observed in this peak transition.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Period 30 demand doubled to 131 units from the August average of 64. Lead time observed at 3 periods (P27 order arrived P30).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 711440001 (a long-sleeve wrapover sweater) is in a significant autumn peak, hitting 164 units in Period 31, up from ~64 units in August. This mirror's the February 'spring transition' peak. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 433 units, but 237 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost legacy shipments. Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 196 units (ordered Period 31). Lead time has varied: while promised is 2, Period 30 saw an arrival with L=3. To ensure coverage during this high-growth phase, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent arrival delays. Mu_hat is set to (1+L=4) periods of demand; with demand trending up (131 to 164), I use a 3-period average (roughly 120/week) to forecast 480 units. Sigma_hat is calculated over the last 3 periods to capture the high volatility of this seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified: Demand reached 164 units in mid-September, up from ~64 in August (+156%). Total effective pipeline inventory is 196 units; 237 units are confirmed lost legacy shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Sweater) is currently in a high-demand Autumn peak. Demand peaked at 164 units in Period 31 and dropped to 131 units in Period 32. This mirrors the early Spring pattern where high demand sustained for several weeks. Lead times are volatile, recently fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P27 arrived in 3 periods, while P31 arrived in 1). I will set L to 2 (promised) as an average expectation. Mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L)*140 units based on the recent 2-period average of 147.5, accounting for a slight downward trend from the peak. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to manage the high volatility seen in this peak stage. In-transit inventory includes 237 units of legacy lost shipments (P1, P3, P4), which the OR backend will ignore for ordering, effectively seeing only the P32 order (47 units) as valid pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand peak sustaining: Average demand for mid-September (Periods 30-32) is ~142 units/week. Lead time volatility observed (ranging 1-3 periods).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Long-sleeve Wrapover Top) reached a massive seasonal peak in Period 33 with demand hitting 293 units, a 123% increase over the previous 3-week average of ~142. This aligns with late September cooler weather transitions. The current in-transit inventory of 355 includes 237 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) and active orders from P32 (47 units) and P33 (71 units). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will use L=2 (promised) as a baseline but set mu_hat explicitly to account for this significant demand surge. I am forecasting a stabilization or slight further increase as we enter October, moving mu_hat to cover a 3-week window (L+1) at a projected rate of 250 units/week (total 750). Sigma_hat is set high to handle the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified significantly in late September: demand spiked to 293 units (P33), up from an average of 142 in early September (+106%). This matches the high-volatility seasonal pattern observed in the Spring.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits strong seasonality (long-sleeve sweater). Demand peaked at 293 in P33 but dropped to 96 in P34, suggesting the Autumn peak is highly volatile. The current in-transit inventory (748) is misleading due to 'legacy lost' shipments (P1, P3, P4 totaling 237 units). Excluding those, the effective pipeline is 511 (P32 order: 47, P33: 71, P34: 393). Note that the P31 order (196) concluded in P32. Lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this variance. Given the sudden drop from 293 to 96, I'll use a recent 4-period window for mu_hat (avg ~171) to avoid over-ordering on the spike while acknowledging the higher baseline compared to August. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the highly right-skewed demand distribution seen in this product category.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn spike volatility: Demand dropped from 293 to 96 (-67%) in P34, indicating a very short or highly inconsistent seasonal peak pattern.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Sweater) is currently in its autumn peak, characterized by high volatility. Demand spiked significantly in P33 (293 units) before dropping to 96 (P34) and 60 (P35). This suggests the intense 'peak of the peak' may be passing, though demand remains substantially higher than the summer trough. The actual lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P32 arrived in 3 periods). As of P36 START, the total in-transit is 701 units. However, we have confirmed that ~237 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 464 units (71 from P33 and 393 from P34). Given the recent demand drop (60 units), 464 units in the pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand at current levels. To avoid over-ordering during a potential post-peak decline, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the average of the last three periods (149.6 units per week) and including the 1-period buffer (L+1=3). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the high volatility of the surge period.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak volatility confirmed: demand peaked at 293 (P33) then declined to 60 (P35). Average lead time remains unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this long-sleeve sweater has entered a clear post-peak decline following the late September surge. Demand decreased from 293 in Period 33 to 96, 60, and now 40 in Period 36. This pattern suggests we are moving out of the primary autumn spike into a more moderate late-autumn/early-winter regime. Actual lead times have been volatile, with the last two arrivals taking 3 periods each (P32 and P33 orders). There is a large order of 393 units from Period 34 still in transit; at a lead time of 3, it should arrive during this period (Period 37). When determining mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 3 to capture the steep downward trend (averaging ~65 units/week) to avoid excessive overstocking as demand cools. I'm setting L to explicit 3 to reflect the current consistent delay in arrivals, and sigma_hat to explicit 60 to account for the high residual volatility seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-autumn spike decay: Demand dropped from 293 (P33) to 40 (P36), an 86% reduction in 3 weeks. Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last two concluded shipments.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the long-sleeve sweater SKU 711440001 is currently in a high-volatility autumn regime. After peaking at 293 in P33, demand drop-off occurred, but P37 showed a slight uptick to 63, suggesting a potential secondary peak or stabilization around 50-70 units for the late autumn/pre-holiday season. Lead time has been volatile but recently stabilized at 3 periods (observed in P30, P35, and P36). Therefore, I will explicitly set L to 3. Pipeline inventory currently shows 630 units; however, historical analysis confirms that approximately 237 units from early-game orders (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost. The actual active pipeline consists of the P34 order (393 units), which is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods. Given that on-hand is 0 and demand is stabilizing around 50-60 units after a volatile peak, I will use a 3-period window (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-peak demand level (~66 units/week) without over-reacting to the extreme P33 spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to account for the sustained high volatility in this season.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consolidated at 3 periods (P35, P36 arrivals). Post-autumn spike demand is stabilizing around 50-65 units/week (P34-P37 avg: 65) after an extreme peak of 293.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, entering the late Autumn/early Winter season. Demand for this long-sleeved wrapover top recently saw an extreme peak (293 in P33) and has since shown high volatility (60, 40, 63, 110 in the last four periods). The 110 units in Period 38 suggests a potential secondary seasonal surge or sustained high demand as temperatures drop. Lead times have recently stabilized at 3 periods (P35, P36 arrivals). We face a critical inventory gap: On-hand is 0 and we are currently stock-out. While In-transit is 630, a significant portion (237 units from P1, P3, P4) is confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 393 units (from P34), which is expected to arrive in Period 37+3=40. To cover the current stock-out and anticipate demand for the next (L+1)=4 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the recent average demand of 81 units (mean of P34-P38) to ensure the OR backend bridges the gap until the P34 order arrives.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consolidated at 3 periods based on P35-P36 arrivals. Late Autumn secondary demand surge detected: P38 demand rose to 110 units after a three-week average of 54.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 711440001 (Women's Sweater) is currently in its secondary Autumn/Winter demand peak. Demand has averaged ~83 units over the last 3 periods (P37-P39: 63, 110, 76), indicating a stabilization after the extreme late-September spike. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times for recent successful arrivals (P35, P36) have been 3 periods. Although 'calculate' is used for L to capture historical variability, the OR backend's cap mechanism requires conservative mu_hat/sigma_hat settings here. In-transit inventory looks high (630 units), however, approximately 237 units are confirmed lost legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4). There is a large pending order from P34 (393 units) which, if it follows the 3-period lead time, should have arrived; its delay suggests potential further lead-time stretching or loss risk. I am setting mu_hat based on the last 4 periods to capture the current demand level (~75 units/week) and sigma_hat to 20 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn secondary demand surge confirmed: Average demand for Nov 2019 (P37-P39) is ~83 units/week, up from late October's ~54 average. Total pipeline inventory includes 237 units of confirmed lost legacy shipments.

After an extreme peak in late September (293 units) and a subsequent crash, demand has stabilized over the last four periods (P37-P40) at an average of 80 units/week (63, 110, 76, 72). This suggests a sustained interest as temperatures drop. However, the supply chain is severely compromised. Currently, there are 630 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, 237 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. The 393 units ordered in Period 34 (lead time of 3 periods expected) are now overdue, as they should have arrived by Period 37 or 38; their absence at the start of P41 suggests they may also be lost or significantly delayed. Despite the high 'In-transit' figure, the on-hand inventory is 0. I will set L to 3 (recent realized average) and mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L+1) at the current regime of ~80 units/week (Total 320). Given the uncertainty of the huge P34 shipment, the OR backend needs to place a replenishment order to address the 0 on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Late Autumn demand regime confirmed at ~80 units/week (Periods 37-40), a 45% stabilization from the high-volatility October average. Shipment from Period 34 (393 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, similar to early Spring legacy losses.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-25. The demand for item 711440001 (a long-sleeve knit sweater) has settled into a late-autumn regime averaging approximately 75 units/week over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), despite high volatility in October. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory is 630 units, but this is highly misleading: 237 units are legacy losses from early 2019 (P1, P3, P4), and the shipment from P34 (393 units) is now 8 periods old, far exceeding the recent observed lead time of 3 periods, suggesting it is also lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. Observed lead times since Period 30 have stabilized at 3 periods (P30: 3, P32: 1, P35: 3, P36: 3). I will set L=3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I'll use explicit calculation (1+L)*75 to ensure the OR backend attempts to cover the 4-period window (Review + Lead) with fresh stock, ignoring the stalled/lost pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 34 (393 units) confirmed lost; total legacy/lost pipeline is now 630 units. Late Autumn demand regime (Nov) stabilized at ~75 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '711440001' (Womens Sweater/Jersey Top) is currently in a high-demand Winter/Holiday season. Period 42 saw a significant demand spike to 148 units, following a stabilized November average of ~75 units. This suggests a secondary seasonal peak or holiday surge. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 630 units is misleading, as it consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4 total 237; P34 total 393). Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is 0. Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in P35, P36, and P37). I am setting L to 3 to reflect this reality. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current late-autumn/early-winter regime (Periods 37-42), which averages 85.6 units/week. This approach allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock (1+3 periods) while accounting for the recent spike to 148. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the increased volatility of the holiday season.

Carry-over insight: December holiday surge detected: Period 42 demand spiked to 148 units (+97% vs Nov average). Actual lead time remains stabilized at 3 periods. Total confirmed lost pipeline inventory is now 630 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), nearing the end of the year. Demand is highly volatile: it historically spiked in early Feb and late Sept, and recently showed a pre-holiday surge in P42 (148 units) followed by a sharp drop in P43 (26 units). This pattern suggests short-lived spikes around events. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is 630 units, all of which are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P34). Therefore, effective inventory is 0. Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in P30, P35, P36). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3. For mu_hat, the December peak is likely passing, but we must protect against residual holiday/post-holiday demand; an average of the last 4 periods (Periods 40-43: (72+45+148+26)/4 = 72.75) is used. With L=3, the mu_hat parameter covers (L+1)=4 periods, thus 72.75 * 4 = 291. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the high volatility of the late autumn/winter season.

Carry-over insight: December demand proves highly volatile: P42 spike (148) followed by P43 drop (26) suggests very short-duration holiday peaks. Effective pipeline remains 0 as all 630 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, and P34.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are in mid-December. Looking at historical arrivals (P32, P35, P36), the actual lead time for successful shipments has stabilized at 3 periods, though lead time is volatile. The total in-transit quantity of 630 units is composed of shipments from P1 (93), P3 (63), P4 (81), and P34 (393). Given that the P34 shipment is now 10 periods old (promised lead time 2) and previous legacy shipments from early in the year never arrived, all 630 units in the pipeline are considered lost. Effectively, on-hand is 0 and pipeline is 0. Demand for the last two periods (P43, P44) has dropped significantly to 26 units after a brief December spike (P42: 148). This suggests the holiday peak for this long-sleeve 'Jersey Fancy' item was extremely short-lived. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the most recent successful lead times. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a recent_N of 4 (covering the last 4 weeks) to capture the stabilization after the holiday spike while maintaining enough safety stock for potential late-December volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-December holiday peak was extremely short; demand collapsed from 148 (P42) to 26 (P43-P44). Pipeline inventory of 630 units is confirmed lost (legacy shipments).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, which is immediately after the mid-December demand peak (P42, 148 units). Current demand has collapsed back to a stable floor of 26 units (P43-P45), signaling the end of the holiday surge for this long-sleeve sweater. In-transit inventory of 630 units is strictly comprised of legacy lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and P34), meaning effective pipeline inventory is 0. Lead time remains volatile but recently consolidated at 3 periods for late-year shipments that actually arrived. Given the demand decay and the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the post-peak stabilization at 26 units, while using explicit L=3 to reflect physical reality rather than the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse: Demand fell from 148 (P42) to a stable floor of 26 units/week (P43-P45), signaling the end of the late-year sweater season.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a long-sleeved jersey wrapover top, which exhibits strong seasonal characteristics. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30, 2019). Demand has collapsed post-holiday from a brief peak of 148 (P42) to a current low of 12 units (P46), signaling the end of the winter season and a transition into the post-holiday trough. Historically, Jan 2019 saw demand around 11 units before the Feb spike. The 630 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P34) are confirmed lost legacy shipments and provide no inventory coverage. Since current demand is low (~12-26 units) and we are entering a period that previously showed very low demand (Jan), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 4-period average (Jan-like demand levels) to avoid over-ordering before the potential Feb seasonal shift. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent observations stabilized at 3 periods, but historical variance is high.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse confirmed: Demand dropped from 148 (P42) to an average of 22 units over the last 4 periods (P43-P46), returning to pre-February trough levels. Total confirmed lost/legacy pipeline inventory remains 630 units.
