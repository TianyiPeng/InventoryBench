Historical demand for the first 5 weeks of 2019 averaged approximately 100 units/week (119, 73, 98, 97, 113). Since the lead time is L=2, the order I place now must cover the demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time periods (P2, P3), as the order placed in P1 will arrive at the start of P4's demand phase. Total demand coverage needed is for 3 periods. Using the mean demand of 100 units/week, I estimate needing 300 units plus a small safety buffer to account for variance (historical range 73-119). I will order 350 units to establish initial inventory and avoid stockouts during the lead time period.",

The order from Period 1 (350 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'.

The total in-transit is 2280. Historical cleaning of the pipeline: P1(350), P3(180), and P4(150) are confirmed lost (7+ periods overdue). Excluding these, the effective in-transit is 1600 units (P10: 500, P12: 600, P13: 500). Expected arrivals for Period 14 (P10 and/or P12) will likely result in a significant inventory surge. Specifically, P10 (500 units) is now 4 periods old and highly likely to arrive or be confirmed lost soon; P12 (600 units) is within the lead time window.

Demand for such staples peaked in April/May (approx. 300-400 units/period) and has been in a steady seasonal decline since. We are now in Period 43 (early December), and the demand regime has reached a seasonal minimum of 2-5 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 189 units. There are only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P43 to P47). Even at a slightly higher demand of 10 units per period (unlikely given the 3-5 range seen in the last 10 periods), total expected demand for the remainder of the game would be ~50 units. Therefore, the current inventory of 189 units covers more than 3 times the expected remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) which would significantly erode profit.
