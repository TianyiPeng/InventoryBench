Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 629420007, a women's cotton t-shirt. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Historically, demand has been stable over the last 5 weeks: 119, 73, 98, 97, 113. The mean demand is 100 with a standard deviation of approximately 17. Since the product is 'Womens Everyday Basics', we expect relatively stable demand, though mid-February could see a minor uptick as spring collections start. With zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior, while keeping the default lead time of 2. The OR engine will target a base stock covering (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 300 units).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a basic T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (130 units) was placed in Period 1 and has a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it shouldn't arrive until the start of Period 3 (observed at the start of Period 4). In Period 1, we saw a demand of 147, which is higher than the historical average of ~100. Since this is a basic item and it's mid-February, we might be seeing a slight build-up toward spring, or just natural variance. Given we have a stockout (0 on-hand), the OR backend needs to place an order that covers the lead time plus the review period (1+L = 3 periods). I will use recent_N for demand to capture the recent spike (147) alongside historicals, and default for lead time as there's no evidence yet to suggest the promised 2-period lead time is incorrect.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Looking at historical demand (Jan: 119, 73, 98, 97; early Feb: 113), demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods (P1: 147, P2: 214), far exceeding the historical average of ~100. This is likely a seasonal transition for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirts' as spring approaches. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in significant lost sales. We have two orders in-transit: P1 (130 units) and P2 (149 units). With a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 resolution (visible in P4). To address the rising demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand forecasting to capture the current upward trend (including P1-P2 and the last historical sample). L is kept at 'default' (2) as we have not yet confirmed any lead-time deviations.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a basic T-shirt. Historically, demand was around 100 units/week in Jan, but peaked significantly in Feb (147, 214, 181), averaging 180 over the last 3 periods. This suggests a seasonal shift into Spring. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (ordered P1, expected P3) and Period 2 (ordered P2, expected P4) have not yet appeared in 'conclude' messages. However, per the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', the P1 order (L=2) arrives DURING P3 and is visible in P4's 'conclude' message. We only have P3 conclude so far (which naturally shows 0 arrived since the P1 order arrives after the P3 decision). We expect the P1 order (130 units) to show as 'arrived' in the next period's history (P4 conclude). Pipeline inventory (522) currently covers the P1, P2, and P3 orders. I will use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the higher Feb/March levels (average ~180). Lead time remains at the default promised L=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting mid-Feb: average weekly demand increased from ~100 to ~180 (+80%) likely due to Spring seasonality for basic T-shirts.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (2019/3/11). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which experiences a demand lift in early Spring as identified in the carry-over insights. Recent historical demand (last 4 weeks): 147, 214, 181, 110 (avg 163). The most recent drop to 110 is likely a fluctuation rather than a change in the upward regime. We have 442 units in transit (ordered in P1, P3, and P4), including a P1 order of 130 units which is now overdue based on the promised lead time of 2 periods (it should have arrived in P3 conclude). However, P2 arrived exactly in 2 periods (arrived P4 conclude). This suggests lead time is generally stable but subject to isolated delays or losses. I will stick with the calculated lead time but set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher Spring demand regime (~163/wk), while sigma_hat will use all samples (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen lately.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt. Historically, demand was ~100 but shifted to ~180 in February. Recent demand samples (P1-P5) are: 147, 214, 181, 110, 142 (Average: 158.8). The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~180, which aligns with early Spring demand. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 516 in-transit. Looking at lead times: P2 order (149 units) arrived in P4 (lead_time = 2). The P1 order (130 units) has not arrived after 5 periods and is likely lost. The P3 order (243 units) was placed in P3 and should arrive in P5 or P6; since P5 conclude shows 0 arrived, we expect it in P6. To cover the next (L+1=3) periods with a target demand of ~160/week, we need a base stock around 480-500. With 516 in-transit (excluding the likely lost P1 order, the 'active' pipeline is P3:243 + P4:69 + P5:74 = 386), the OR engine needs to order more. I will set L to the promised 2, mu_hat to 480 (160 * 3) using 'explicit' to account for the recent demand level and the loss of the P1 shipment which the backend doesn't see.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed loss of Period 1 shipment (130 units) as it has not arrived after 5 periods (Promised L=2). Effective pipeline inventory is lower than system 'In-transit' count suggests.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt', which is experiencing a Spring demand shift. Historical demand for the last five periods (P2-P6) has averaged ~161 units/week, significantly higher than the initial seed data (~100 units). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. Lead time analysis: P2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), and P5 order arrived in 1 period (P6). However, the P1 order (130 units) is confirmed lost, and the P3 order (243 units) is now overdue (ordered P3, expected P5, currently P7). The system 'In-transit' of 465 likely includes the lost 130 and the overdue 243. To compensate for the lost stock and the unreliable pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher Spring demand regime (~161 * (1+L)). I will use the 'explicit' method for L to set it at 2 (promised) while monitoring if the P3 order is also lost. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 shipment (243 units) is now 2 periods overdue (Expected P5, current P7), suggesting potential supply chain disruption or a second lost shipment.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), we are managing SKU 629420007 (Women's T-shirt). Demand analysis shows a significant upward trend as Spring progresses, with the most recent observed demand hitting 260 units. The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 168 units. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: Period 1 (130 units) is confirmed lost. Period 3 (243 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P3, expected P5, now P8), while Period 5 (74 units) unexpectedly arrived in only 1 period. Due to these inconsistencies and the zero on-hand inventory, I must set the base stock high to account for both rising seasonal demand and the high probability of lost or delayed shipments. I am treating the Period 3 shipment as functionally lost to force the OR engine to order sufficient stock. I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting (1+L) * 180 units and a higher sigma to ensure a higher service level during this stockout phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 shipment (243 units) is now 3 periods overdue and is officially treated as lost in parameter calculations. Actual lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 5+ (lost) periods. Demand is peaking with the shift into April.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/4/8). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is surging as we move deeper into spring, with Period 8 demand reaching 311 units. The mean demand over the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is approximately 218 units, but the last two periods show a significant acceleration (260, 311). I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this growth, forecasting a weekly average of ~280 units. Lead time is unstable: while P5 and P7 arrived in 1 period, P1 and P3 are confirmed lost, and P2/P6 arrived in 2 periods. Because P1 and P3 are lost, the system 'In-transit' of 523 includes 373 phantom units (130+243). Real pipeline is only 150 (P8 order 81 + likely nothing else reliable). L=2 is the safest operational estimate. \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L)*280 = 840. \u03c3\u0302 is set to 150 to reflect the high demand volatility observed during this seasonal ramp.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: April surge observed with demand hitting 311. Average shifting from ~180 (March) to ~280+ (April). Supply chain remains unstable with 2/8 shipments (25%) confirmed lost (P1, P3).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019/4/15). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Demand has surged in April (avg ~297 over the last two weeks) compared to March (~180). Supply chain issues are severe: Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (243 units) shipments are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 946 includes these 373 lost units, meaning effective pipeline inventory is only 573. On-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. To compensate for the lost stock and high demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*310 = 930 to cover the current peak demand level. sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for recent high volatility. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to capture the mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals, though the backend OR logic will naturally be conservative given the stockout history.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Supply chain risk elevated; 373 units (P1, P3) confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is 'Total In-Transit - 373'. Demand is stabilized at a high-level regime (>280) for the April seasonal peak.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11 (2019/04/22). The product 'Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt' is currently in its seasonal Spring/April peak. Looking at history, demand has surged from a February/March average of ~160 to an April average of ~304 (P8-P10: 311, 283, 318). I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average of 304 x (L+1)) to maintain stock for this high-demand regime. Regarding the supply chain, we have confirmed losses from Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (243 units), totaling 373 'ghost' units in the In-transit count (511 total - 373 lost = 138 effective). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, it will think we have 511 units coming. To force the engine to place an order despite these ghost units, I will use an 'explicit' L to increase the base stock level. By setting L to 4 (double the promised 2), the base stock calculation (1+L) will expand to cover 5 periods of demand, effectively compensating for the ~370 missing units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of the peak period.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime confirmed at ~305 units/week. Supply chain reliability is low, with a 33% failure rate (P1, P3 shipments lost).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), we are in a high-demand regime for this basic T-shirt, with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 327 units over the last 4 weeks (311, 283, 318, 396). The supply chain remains unreliable: while some recent orders (P8, P9) arrived with 1-2 period lead times, orders from P1 (130 units) and P3 (243 units) are confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system 'In-transit' shows 846 units, but 373 of these (P1+P3) are lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 473 units (P10: 69, P11: 335, P4: 69). To compensate for the 33% historical loss rate and avoid stockouts during this seasonal peak, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 1200, which covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand at a rate of 400 units/period (slightly above the recent 396, accounting for the growth trend). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a robust safety buffer against both demand volatility and further shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified at the end of April, reaching 396 units in Period 11, raising the new baseline for the seasonal peak to ~350-400 units/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak demand phase (May) for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirts'. Recent demand (Periods 11-12) averaged 368 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: shipments from Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (243 units) are definitively lost, totaling 373 phantom units in the 'In-transit' count (1327 total). This means the effective pipeline is only 954 units. To offset this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Baseline demand (370) * (1 + L=2) = 1110. Adding the lost 373 units back into the safety stock/order requirement for this period results in a target mu_hat of 1483. This allows the backend to order enough to cover both current demand and the missing stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to capture the higher volatility of the current peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: May demand confirmed at ~370 baseline. Effective pipeline inventory calculation adjusted: Total In-Transit (1327) minus confirmed lost units (373) leaves 954 units. Parameters are adjusted to force the OR engine to order replacements for lost stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 Context: We are in mid-May. After an April demand surge (>300), Period 13 saw a lower demand of 193, possibly a reporting anomaly or a short-term dip, but the broader Spring/Summer baseline for basic T-shirts remains elevated around 350 units/week. Supply Chain: Shipments from P1 (130) and P3 (243) are definitively lost (373 total). The system reports 1218 in-transit; subtracting 373 lost units yields an effective healthy pipeline of 845 units. Current on-hand is 142. Strategy: To ensure the OR backend covers the loss, I must inflate mu_hat. Promised L=2, so we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Forecasting a 3-period demand of ~1050 (350 * 3) plus a buffer for the lost 373 units = 1423. Subtracting current on-hand (142) leaves a requirement of ~1280. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the base_stock calculation accounts for the high seasonal demand and the missing 373 units, effectively forcing the system to re-order the lost inventory while maintaining a safe service level for the 350 units/week regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 629420007 (Women's T-shirt) is currently in a high-demand late-Spring regime, though observed demand has dipped slightly from April peaks (396) to May levels (~200-230). Period 14 ending inventory is 393. The supply chain has a significant issue: shipments from P1 (130 units) and P3 (243 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 373 units that appear in 'In-transit' (910) but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to bridge this gap, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to account for the 'phantom' stock in the pipeline. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the pipeline is evaluated across (L+1)=3 periods. To offset 373 lost units, I need to add approximately 124 units (373/3) to the weekly forecast. Recent demand (P13-P14) averaged 211, but April averaged ~330. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 360 = 1080. This value captures current demand expectations while effectively 'writing off' the lost 373 units by making the base stock target higher than the pipeline inventory + on-hand total. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (recent std range ~80). L remains at the promised 2 as arrivals for P11 and P12 were on time.

Carry-over insight: May demand stabilization confirmed: Weekly demand for P13-P14 averaged 211 units, down from the April peak of 337 units (-37%), establishing a new late-Spring baseline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019/05/27) shows demand continuing to stabilize in the post-April peak regime. The last three periods (P13-P15) show demand of 193, 230, and 259, averaging ~227 units/week. This is a significant drop from the April peak of ~340, but higher than the early-Spring baseline. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this new stabilization. Regarding lead times, the last three arrivals (P11, P12, P13 orders) all arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized after early-season volatility and losses (P1 and P3 are officially written off). On-hand inventory is 134, and the effective pipeline (In-transit minus the 373 lost units) is 537 units. Total inventory position is ~671. With a forecast of ~227 per week and L=2, the required base stock (targeting 3 weeks of coverage) is roughly 681 units. My parameters are set to maintain this level.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 17 (2019/6/3). On-hand inventory is 0 after selling 134 units against a demand of 218 in Period 16. Analyzing demand: May showed a clear downward shift from the April peak, stabilizing around ~230 units/week (P14: 230, P15: 259, P16: 218; Mean = 235). This suggests a post-peak summer baseline for 'Everyday Basics'. Analyzing Supply Chain: 373 units (P1, P3) are definitively lost. Total In-Transit is 910, consisting of P13 (226 units), P14 (173 units), and the 373 lost units (plus 138 missing from previous period audit, likely P15/16 were zero orders but the math suggests we are missing the 'In-Transit' components). Actually, looking at orders: P13(226), P14(173), P15(0), P16(0). 226 + 173 = 399 viable units in transit + 373 lost units = 772 units. The reported 910 suggests other units are floating or lost. To manage this safely, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period demand (N=3) which captures the current ~235 average. I will use L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P11, P12) came in exactly at 2 periods. I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~705 units). With 0 on-hand and only 399 viable units arriving soon, the OR engine needs to place an order to bridge the gap and account for the 373 lost units effectively removed from the 'pipeline'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for early Summer: Period 14-16 average demand is 235 units/week, down from April peak (~350). Current supply chain reliability indicates arrivals are consistently hitting L=2 periods now, despite earlier losses.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), we are in early summer for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt. The extreme demand spikes observed in April (~337 avg) have subsided, stabilizing into a June regime. Over the last four periods (P14-P17), demand has averaged 216.75 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the in-transit pipeline officially shows 910 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, we must account for 373 units (from P1 and P3) that are confirmed lost. This makes the effective pipeline 537 units. Arrival patterns have stabilized recently at L=2 (orders from P11 and P12 arrived in P13 and P14 respectively), though we saw no arrivals in P15-P17 because no orders were placed in P13-P14. To account for the confirmed lower demand regime while ensuring the OR backend handles the missing stock correctly, I am using mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the current ~217 unit average, and Setting L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead-time history. The effective inventory gap (on-hand 0 + effective pipeline 537 = 537) vs. a target stock for (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 217 = 651) should trigger a moderate replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Early Summer demand regime (June) confirmed: Average demand for P14-P17 is 217 units/week, establishing a stable post-Spring peak baseline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Mid-June (2019-06-17). Demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Basic T-shirt' follows a clear seasonal pattern: it peaked in April (avg ~330), entered a transition in May, and has declined throughout June. The last four periods (P15-P18) show demand of 259, 218, 160, and 124, respectively. This downward trend justifies a recent-N window (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the decelerating Summer demand, preventing overstocking as the seasonal peak passes. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 910 units in-transit. However, based on confirmed losses from P1 (130) and P3 (243), 373 units are permanently lost. The actual in-transit pipeline is 537 units. Orders from P13 (226) and P14 (173) are significantly overdue (5-6 periods), suggesting either further supply chain failure or extreme delays. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation, I will keep L at default (2) but use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it significantly lower to account for the current 'trapped' pipeline inventory and the declining demand trend, ensuring we don't trigger massive new orders while waiting for the P13/P14 backlog.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Late Summer demand decline confirmed; June demand dropped from 259 (P15) to 124 (P18). P13 (226 units) and P14 (173 units) are now 5-6 periods overdue, potentially lost or severely delayed, bringing total suspected pipeline loss/delay to 772 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). We are in a post-Spring peak 'Summer lull' regime where demand has dropped from ~350 units/week in April to an average of ~140 units/week over the last three periods (P17-P19). On-hand inventory is 0. System 'In-transit' shows 910 units, but historical evidence suggests severe supply chain issues: Orders from P1 (130), P3 (243), P13 (226), and P14 (173) are all well past the promised lead time of 2 and have likely been lost or indefinitely delayed. The sum of these 'phantom' units is 772. Subtracting these from the 910 in-transit units gives an effective pipeline inventory of only 138 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline count, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. I calculated mu_hat based on the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) using the current average demand (~140 * 3 = 420) and then added the 772 lost units to the base stock requirement. Total mu_hat = 420 + 772 = 1192. This forces the engine to recognize the need for replenishment. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent deliveries (before the current stall) adhered to this lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure exacerbated: Total suspected lost or indefinitely delayed units now reach 772 (P1, P3, P13, P14). Demand has stabilized at a summer low of ~140 units/week (P17-P19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are entering the mid-summer season for Women's Everyday T-shirts. Historical demand has settled into a lower summer regime, with the last four periods (P17-P20) averaging approximately 132 units/week. The supply chain has significant reliability issues. Total In-transit is 1276 units, but 772 units are confirmed/highly suspected as lost (P1: 130, P3: 243, P13: 226, P14: 173). This leaves an effective pipeline of 504 units (including the 366 ordered in P20). At current demand, this effective pipeline covers nearly 4 weeks of demand, which is sufficient given L=2. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 140 = 420 to reflect the current summer stabilization and prevent over-ordering against a bloated, unreliable in-transit figure. L is set to explicit 2 to reflect the promised lead time, as recent successful deliveries followed this pattern before the recent P13/P14 failures.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand floor established: Demand for P17-P20 averaged 132 units, marking the seasonal low. Total likely lost inventory from supply chain failures (P1, P3, P13, P14) is 772 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 (July 8). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt'. Historically, demand peaked in April (~350) and has steadily declined through May and June. The current demand regime (Periods 18-21) has stabilized at a summer floor, averaging ~112 units per week (124, 135, 109, 81). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a total of 772 units (Orders from P1, P3, P13, and P14) confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as they are all at least 6 periods past their promised lead time. This results in an effective pipeline of 504 units (Total 1276 - Lost 772). The order placed in Period 20 (366 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 22 or 23. To prevent over-ordering due to the backend's ignorance of lost shipments, I will use an explicit L=2 and set mu_hat to cover the current demand regime (Mean ~112, L+1=3). sigma_hat is set to capture the volatility of the recent decline. This ensures we maintain a base stock that accounts for the summer floor without bloating inventory as demand likely stays low or begins a slow ascent for late summer/fall.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed July demand floor: P18-P21 average is 112 units/week, marking a significant drop from the spring peak. Total confirmed supply chain loss remains at 772 units (P1, P3, P13, P12).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15), we are in the middle of summer, which is the historical demand floor for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt). The demand for the last four periods (P19-P22) has been 135, 109, 81, and 54, showing a continuing downward trend as we move past the spring peak. The average demand of the last 4 periods is 95 units, significantly lower than the spring average of ~350, though we should be cautious about setting mu_hat too low given the product is a 'basic'. Supply chain assessment: Total In-transit is 910 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights from P6, P8, and P19, shipments from P1 (130), P3 (243), P13 (226), and P14 (173) are extremely overdue (8-22 periods) and are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. This totals 772 units that exist in the system's pipeline count but will not arrive. Effective pipeline is 910 - 772 = 138 units. On-hand is 312. Current total effective inventory is 450 units. With a demand forecast around 100/week and L=2, the total required stock is ~300. Thus, we are currently overstocked for the summer floor. I will set L to 2, mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent low-demand regime, and sigma_hat based on the same period to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed July demand floor: The downward trend continued in Period 22 with demand hitting 54 units; the average for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is 100.6 units, establishing the summer trough.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late July (Period 24, July 22). This product (Women's Everyday Basics T-shirt) is a seasonal item that saw a massive peak in April/May and has since entered a significant summer trough. Demand for the last 6 periods (P18-P23) has been: 124, 135, 109, 81, 54, 56. The average demand for the last three periods is ~64 units/week. On-hand inventory is 256, which covers over 4 weeks of current demand. Additionally, we have 910 units 'In-transit'. However, our history shows substantial pipeline losses: P1 (130), P3 (243), P13 (226), and P14 (173) are all well past their promised 2-period lead time and are considered lost, totaling 772 units. The 'effective' in-transit inventory is actually 138 units (910 - 772). Because our on-hand (256) plus effective in-transit (138) equals 394 units\u2014enough for ~6 weeks of current demand\u2014we should avoid ordering more and allow inventory to bleed down as we remain in the summer floor. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (approx 91 units/week) to capture the current low-demand regime and using explicit L=6 for lead time to signal the backend that a large chunk of the pipeline is essentially 'dead' and needs to be accounted for in the base stock calculation, preventing it from over-ordering while still recognizing the supply chain volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed July/August demand floor: Weekly demand has stabilized at ~60-80 units, a 75%+ reduction from the April peak. Total confirmed/suspected supply chain losses remain at 772 units (P1, P3, P13, P14).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (Late July): The SKU 'claudine' (basic T-shirt) is in a seasonal trough. Demand for the last 5 periods (P20-P24) has been 109, 81, 54, 56, 38, averaging roughly 68 units/week. This confirms the summer demand floor identified in previous insights. Supply Chain: Total 'In-transit' is 910 units, but 772 units (P1, P3, P13, P14) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (over 10 periods past promised lead time). The effective 'In-transit' is actually 138 units (remaining from recent history/backlog). Current on-hand is 218 units, which covers ~3 weeks of the current low demand floor. Given the heavy holding cost ($1.0) and declining demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the summer trough (approx 68 units/week). To avoid over-ordering due to the 'ghost' pipeline status, I will use 'explicit' L=2. The OR backend uses (1+L) * mean, so base stock will be roughly 3 * 68 = 204. Since on-hand (218) > 204, no new orders should be triggered, which is correct for reducing high holding costs during the off-season.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed August demand floor: Demand for P20-P24 averaged 67.6 units/week, representing the seasonal lows for basic T-shirts. Supply chain losses remain fixed at 772 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is August 5, 2019 (Period 26). The SKU is a basic cotton T-shirt, and demand has entered its seasonal trough (Summer low). Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the average demand is 54.4 units/week, down significantly from the Spring peak. Total In-Transit inventory is 910 units, but 772 units (ordered in P1, P3, P13, and P14) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are several months overdue. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 138 units, plus on-hand inventory of 175, totaling 313 available units. At a current demand rate of ~55-60 units, this stock covers approximately 5 periods. Given that we are at the seasonal bottom and have sufficient coverage for the next few periods, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to reflect the current floor and keep L as default (2), as recent arrivals have reverted to the promised lead time of 2.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the seasonal trough for women's basic cotton T-shirts. Demand has consistently declined from its April peak (~350 units) to a stable summer floor. Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand averaged 43.2 units/week, with the most recent sample at 25. Supply chain analysis: Total in-transit is 910 units, but 772 units (from Orders P1, P3, P13, and P14) are confirmed or highly suspected as lost/indefinitely delayed. However, the existing on-hand inventory (150) plus the valid portion of the pipeline (910 - 772 = 138 units) provides 288 units of effective stock. At the current demand rate of ~43 units/week, this covers over 6 weeks of supply, which is more than sufficient for the (L+1=3) period window. No new orders are needed. Parameters are set using recent_N=5 (P22-P26) to reflect the current low-demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a significant seasonal trough. Historical demand has plummeted from an April peak of ~350 units to a late-summer average of 40-50 units per week. In the last three periods (P25-P27), demand was 43, 25, and 38 respectively (avg = 35.3). On-hand inventory is 112 units, which covers over 3 weeks of current demand. Total In-transit is 910 units, but 772 of these (P1, P3, P13, P14) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, leaving a real pipeline of 138 units. Combined with on-hand stock, there is enough supply to meet current demand without ordering. To prevent the OR engine from ordering replacements for the lost units during this low-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to match the current low-demand regime (avg ~40) and sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility at this floor. Lead time L is set to default (2) as recent arrivals have stabilized to the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: August trough confirmed: Demand for P25-P27 averaged 35 units/week, the lowest regime recorded. Total pipeline inventory remains compromised by 772 units (P1, P3, P13, P14), which are now more than 10 periods overdue and treated as permanent losses.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We are in the deepest part of the summer trough for this T-shirt SKU. Demand over the last 4 periods (P25-P28) has averaged 31.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 92 units, which covers nearly 3 weeks of current demand. The pipeline remains significantly distorted by 772 units of confirmed/suspected lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14). Official 'In-transit' is 910, but effective in-transit is only 138 units (910 - 772). Because current on-hand (92) plus effective in-transit (138) totals 230 units\u2014which is massive compared to the current demand of ~30/week\u2014no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the record-low demand regime (avg ~32). I will set L to explicit '10' to force the OR engine to recognize the inflated pipeline and prevent it from ordering against 'phantom' stock, although with demand this low, the cap will likely prevent ordering anyway.

Demand has plummeted from an April high of ~350 units/week to a very low August average of 24 units/week (P26-P29: 25, 38, 20, 13). System inventory shows 79 units on-hand and 910 units in-transit. However, the carry-over insights confirm that 772 of these in-transit units (from P1, P3, P13, and P14) are effectively lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 138 units. Despite this reduction, total effective inventory (79 on-hand + 138 effective pipeline = 217 units) is still very high relative to the current demand regime (~24 units/week). With L=2, the backend will target covering 3 periods of demand (~72 units). Since 217 > 72, the system should rightly place zero orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P25-P29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this seasonal low and prevent over-ordering as we transition into Autumn.

Carry-over insight: September demand start: Trough continues into early September with Period 29 demand at a record low of 13 units. Seasonal recovery for 'Everyday Basics' not yet visible.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a deep demand trough for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, with Period 30 demand hitting a record low of 11 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 21.4 units/week, illustrating the extreme seasonality of this product. Our current on-hand inventory is 68 units, which covers over 3 weeks of current demand. The system shows an in-transit balance of 910 units, but 772 of those (from orders in P1, P3, P13, and P14) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on carry-over history. This leaves an effective pipeline of 138 units (likely very recent or system-reconciled orders). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) and the ongoing demand trough, we must minimize inventory to avoid waste. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=5 (capturing the current regime) and use the promised lead time of 2, as recent arrivals (P22) have returned to the expected L=2 schedule.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-September (Period 32). Historical demand for this women's jersey basic T-shirt has bottomed out during the late summer/early autumn period, with recent demand (P28-P31) averaging only 14 units per week. This follows a high spring peak and a steady summer decline. The supply chain has significant unreliability; however, the most recent arriving shipment (P20 which arrived in P22) showed a return to the promised lead time of 2 periods. Total 'In-transit' is 910 units, but 772 of these (orders from P1, P3, P13, P14) are severely overdue and considered lost based on previous analysis. The 'effective' in-transit is therefore significantly lower. Given the current on-hand inventory (55) and the extremely low demand regime (avg ~14), no new orders are currently needed. I will set mu_hat to capture the current trough (recent_N=5) and L to default (2) to avoid over-ordering while the system still works through existing stock and accounts for the 772 lost units in its internal logic.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (Sept 23), the product is in its deep seasonal trough. Demand for 'Everyday Basics' T-shirts has hit a record low, with the most recent sample (Period 32) at only 8 units and a 4-period average (P29-P32) of approx 11.25 units. The inventory position is currently 47 units on-hand with 910 in-transit. Crucially, as documented in several carry-over insights, 772 units of that 'in-transit' stock (from P1, P3, P13, and P14) are confirmed or suspected lost/indefinitely delayed. However, even excluding those lost units, the remaining 138 units in recent pipeline + 47 on-hand (Total 185) vastly exceeds the required base stock for a demand regime of ~12 units/week. Since profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (q=0.8), and current inventory covers months of demand at the present rate, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent trough (N=5) and L to default to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal low.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 30, 2019. The SKU 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is currently in a deep seasonal trough following the Summer period. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 10 units per week over the last four periods (P30-P33). On-hand inventory is 38 units, which covers nearly 4 weeks of current demand. Although 'In-transit' shows 910 units, history confirms 772 units are essentially lost (P1, P3, P13, P14), leaving an effective pipeline of 138 units (likely units from older orders that will never arrive). Given the holding cost of $1.00 vs. profit of $4.00 and the current low demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this record-low demand trough and prevent the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders while we wait for any potential Autumn recovery.

Carry-over insight: September trough confirmed: Demand for P30-P33 averaged 10.3 units/week, the lowest regime recorded to date. This marks the full seasonal bottom for 'Everyday Basics'.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early October (2019/10/7). Historical demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirts' showed a significant surge in Spring (reaching ~350-400 units), followed by a steady decline through Summer, reaching a 'seasonal bottom' in September where demand has averaged ~10 units/week for several periods (P30-P34 average is 8.8). The current on-hand inventory is 35 units, and 'In-transit' is 910 units. However, based on carry-over insights, 772 of those units (from P1, P3, P13, and P14) are confirmed or highly suspected losses, making the true effective pipeline 138 units. Given the extremely low current demand and the fact that we have 35 units on hand (covering ~3-4 weeks of current demand) plus 138 reliable units in transit, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (using recent_N=5 to capture the September trough) and maintain a low sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility at these levels. This prevents the OR engine from triggering unnecessary orders while we wait to see if an Autumn/Winter seasonal recovery begins.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-October (Period 36). Historical demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirts' shows a profound seasonal trough from July through September, with the most recent four periods (P32-P35) averaging only 5.75 units/week. This follows a high spring peak (April ~350 units) and a moderate early summer (June ~130 units). Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: out of 910 units in-transit, 772 units (ordered in P1, P3, P13, and P14) are severely overdue and have been officially classified as lost in several carry-over insights. This leaves an effective pipeline of 138 units (likely components of more recent orders, though no orders were placed between P21 and P35). On-hand inventory is 32 units, which covers over 5 weeks of current demand levels. Given the seasonal cycle of basic apparel, we anticipate a potential late-autumn or winter recovery, but as of Period 35, there is no evidence of this starting. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 10-period regime (P26-P35) to reflect the 'bottom' of the market accurately while maintaining a small safety buffer. I will use 'explicit' for L to account for the unreliability of the supply chain, though 'default' (2) is used for the OR math to avoid over-ordering against phantom pipeline stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 21, 2019. The product is a women's everyday cotton t-shirt, which is currently in its seasonal trough after a huge spring peak. Historical demand data from early 2019 (January/February) shows demand levels around 100 units/week. Since Period 34, demand has bottomed out further, averaging just ~3.3 units/week over the last three weeks. We are currently moving into late October; while a major holiday surge is possible later, current demand remains extremely low. On-hand inventory is 28 units, which covers roughly 8 periods of current demand levels. Pipeline inventory is significantly overstated at 910 units; carry-over insights confirm that 772 units (P1, P3, P13, P14) are permanently lost or indefinitely delayed. The effective 'live' pipeline is 138 units (910 - 772). Given the significant on-hand stock relative to current low demand and the presence of live units in the pipeline, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to an explicit low value to prevent the OR backend from over-ordering while awaiting a potential late-year seasonal shift.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28, transitioning into the pre-holiday/winter season for 'Women's Everyday Basics'. Demand has been in a sustained seasonal trough for 8+ periods (P30-P37), averaging ~7 units/week. On-hand inventory is 23 units, which comfortably covers this low-demand regime for the lead time (L+1). Total in-transit inventory is 910 units, but 772 units (P1, P3, P13, P14) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. However, even with the effective pipeline (138 units), the SKU is overstocked for the current demand regime. We move mu_hat to a recent_N (N=8) to capture the very low seasonal trough (avg ~7) and keep L at default (2) as recent arrivals (P22) showed stabilization. No new orders are needed as current stock and viable incoming units far exceed demand.

Carry-over insight: September/October seasonal bottom confirmed: Demand for P30-P37 averaged 7.0 units/week, down from the previous August trough of ~35 units. This confirms a deeper-than-expected stagnant period for basic T-shirts.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 39 (early November). Historically, this 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt has seen its lowest demand levels during September and October (averaging approx. 7 units/week). We are now moving into November; while there is no evidence yet of a late-autumn recovery, we must maintain a minimal stock level to cover the transition. The on-hand inventory is currently 18 units, which is sufficient for about 2.5 weeks at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' count of 910 units is heavily skewed by 772 units of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 13, and 14). This leaves an effective pipeline of 138 units, though no new orders have been placed recently. Given the extremely low demand (P30-P38 mean \u2248 6.8), I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this trough while providing enough cushion for a potential early November uptick. Lead time L is set to 'default' as recent successful arrivals (P22) aligned with the promised L=2.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal bottom for Women's Everyday Basics (Jersey T-shirt) has persisted since Period 30, with demand for the last 10 periods (P30-P39) averaging only 6.5 units per week. The current date is November 11th, which is typically a pre-holiday lull for basic cotton jersey items before potential late-November/December gifting interest. On-hand inventory is 14 units, which actually covers over 2 weeks of current demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 910 units is heavily skewed by 772 units of confirmed or highly probable long-term losses (P1, P3, P13, P14). The effective pipeline is approximately 138 units, which is more than sufficient for a demand regime of ~7 units/week. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the specific stability of this seasonal floor while ensuring the OR engine doesn't over-order against a pipeline of lost units that are now 10-40 periods overdue.

Carry-over insight: Deep seasonal trough confirmed: Period 30-39 demand averaged 6.5 units/week. Supply chain pipeline remains compromised by 772 units of historical losses (P1, P3, P13, P14), which creates a persistent gap between system 'In-transit' and actual expected arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, which is currently in a deep seasonal trough (Period 30-40 demand average: 6.5 units/week). We are now in mid-November (Period 41). Historically, this product saw a significant demand surge starting in February. With an on-hand inventory of 11 units and a system 'In-transit' of 910 units (of which 772 units from P1, P3, P13, and P14 are confirmed losses), the actual effective pipeline is 138 units. Given the extremely low current demand, the 11 units on-hand plus the 138 units of 'real' in-transit stock are more than sufficient to cover the remaining 6-7 periods of the game, even if a small pre-holiday or early-spring uptick occurs. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 2 periods (as recent non-lost shipments arrived in 2 periods). I am using 'recent_N' for demand (N=11) to capture the current trough regime of ~6.5 units/week. No new orders are necessary.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts has remained in a deep seasonal trough since early September, with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 3.4 units (P38-P41). On-hand inventory is 9 units, which is sufficient to cover nearly 3 weeks of current demand. The system shows an 'In-transit' figure of 910 units, but historical analysis confirms that 772 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P13, and P14) are effectively lost or permanently delayed. The actual viable pipeline is approximately 138 units, which is still far in excess of the negligible current demand. Given the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 47) and the stable trough, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current floor and minimize holding costs, while keeping L at the default promised lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 43 (early December). The product 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt' is at its seasonal demand trough. Demand has been extremely low throughout October and November, averaging only ~3.5 units/week over the last 10 periods (P33-P42). The system shows 910 units in-transit, but based on historical context, 772 of these units (from P1, P3, P13, and P14) are confirmed/likely lost or indefinitely delayed, leaving an effective pipeline of 138 units. With on-hand inventory at 5 units and a weekly demand of less than 5 units, the current stock + the effective pipeline (138 units) is more than sufficient to cover many periods of demand at the current trough rate. However, we must remain cautious of the Spring surge seen in February of the previous year (starting around Period 4 when demand jumped from ~100 to ~180). Given the 2-period lead time, we set mu_hat to capture the current trough while sigma_hat is set to a baseline to handle any small volatility. No new ordering is required yet as the pipeline far exceeds needs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (December 9). The product is a women's cotton jersey T-shirt (Everyday Basics). Historically, demand for this item peaked in April/May (~350 units) and has since entered a deep seasonal trough starting in September. For the last 10+ periods (P34-P43), demand has been extremely low, averaging only ~3 units per week. The system shows an 'In-transit' balance of 910 units; however, as documented since Period 20, 772 of these units are attributed to lost shipments from earlier in the year (P1, P3, P13, P14) that never arrived. The effective pipeline is approximately 138 units. With on-hand inventory at 5 units and current demand hovering at near-zero levels, no new orders are necessary. The goal is to minimize holding costs during this stagnant period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current low-demand regime (avg ~3) and 'explicit' for L to maintain the promised lead time of 2, while the OR backend naturally suppresses ordering due to the high (though mostly lost) in-transit count and low demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics T-shirts' is at a deep seasonal trough, averaging roughly 3-4 units per week over the last 15 periods. The system 'In-transit' figure of 910 units is heavily distorted by 772 units of confirmed historical losses (P1, P3, P13, P14), which are now over 30 periods overdue. The effective pipeline is actually 138 units. Since current on-hand inventory is 2 units and weekly demand is negligible (<5), the existing 138-unit shipment (ordered in P40 context or earlier, though not explicitly listed in recent order logs, it accounts for the in-transit balance) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of the game. I will set the delivery lead time to 'calculate' to use historical averages and use a very small 'recent_N' for demand to match the current seasonal floor, preventing unnecessary ordering and minimizing holding costs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the deep seasonal winter trough for 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirts. Demand has been consistently minimal (between 0-5 units) since Period 40. Historical data from early 2019 (Feb-May) showed a massive surge from ~100 to over 350 units/week as spring approached. Although current demand is near zero, we must prepare for the late Q1/early Q2 'Spring' recovery seen in the previous year's history starting around February. However, with 1 unit on-hand and 910 units in-transit (even accounting for the 772 units assumed lost/indefinitely delayed from Periods 1, 3, 13, and 14, there are 138 units of 'good' inventory still in the pipeline), no new ordering is required. Total inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 139 units, which is significantly more than the current demand of ~2 units/week. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current trough while keeping sigma low to minimize holding costs on redundant stock.

Carry-over insight: End-of-year seasonal bottom confirmed: Period 40-45 demand averaged 2.1 units/week, marking the lowest sustained activity level for this SKU. Effective pipeline remains at 138 units after deducting 772 units in permanently lost shipments.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019, which is the very end of the year. Historically, demand for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt has plummeted throughout the second half of the year, reaching a stagnant floor. For the last 10 periods (P37-P46), demand has averaged approximately 2.8 units per week. The supply chain has failed significantly with 772 units (P1, P3, P13, P14) confirmed as long-term losses. While 'In-transit' shows 910 units, the effective pipeline is only 138 units. However, current on-hand inventory is 0. Given the extremely low demand regime (2.1-2.8 units/week), even the remaining effective pipeline (138 units) is more than sufficient to cover projectable demand for several months. No new orders are needed. L is set to 'calculate', mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' using N=10 to reflect the current end-of-year trough.
