Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 108775044 (Womens Everyday Basics Vest Top). Historical data from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a mean demand of 134 units across 5 weeks, with a slight downward trend and some volatility (std dev ~19). Lead time is promised at 2 periods. Since February is a pre-spring period for 'Everyday Basics', demand should remain stable or slightly increase. With zero inventory (on-hand or in-transit), the priority is establishing a stock level. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (N=5) and stick with the promised lead time 'default' (2 periods). Given the profit/holding ratio (1:1), the OR backend will target a 50% service level, which is appropriate for basic items with significant holding costs relative to profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a Women's 'Strap Top' (Everyday Basic). In Period 1, we ordered 166 units with a promised lead time of 2 periods. The demand in Period 1 was 157, but since we started with 0 on-hand inventory and the order (placed in Period 1) will only arrive in Period 3 (L=2), we sold 0 units and ended with 0 inventory. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) average 134 units/week. Period 1 demand was slightly higher at 157. Given the 'Everyday Basic' nature, demand is relatively stable, though we should monitor for any spring-season upticks. I will use the promised lead time (L=2) and calculate the demand forecast using all 6 available samples (5 historical + Period 1) to ensure we cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand required for the base stock calculation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 3 (2019-02-25), the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~134 units/period, but actual demand in P1 (157) and P2 (244) shows a significant upward trend, likely due to spring seasonality transition in late February. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 336 units in-transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (166 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and will be reflected in the P4 start observation. Since sold units have been 0 due to stockouts, we must aggressively forecast based on the recent demand spike. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the recent P1-P2 demand increase (average 200.5) to calculate mu_hat, ensuring the base stock covers the (L+1) horizon.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top. We are currently in Period 4 (March 4th). Historical demand from the initial samples (Jan-Feb) hovered around 134 units/week. However, the last three periods (Feb 11 - Feb 25) showed a significant increase: 157, 244, and 175 (mean: 192), likely reflecting a seasonal shift toward spring basics. On-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no orders have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (placed Feb 11) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. Per the rules, an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives during Period 3's resolution and is visible at the start of Period 4. Since the transit shows 602 units (166+170+266), the Period 1 order IS expected to have arrived but hasn't updated the 'conclude' message effectively or is slightly delayed. I will stick to L=2 but prepare for the higher demand regime. I'll use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (N=3 periods of active game history showing higher demand) and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 is a 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics). We are currently at Period 5 (2019/3/11). History shows demand has Been volatile: 157, 244, 175, 149 (plus pre-game samples of 162, 142, 115, 133, 118). The average demand across all 9 available points is approximately 149 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, and Period 4's arrival (ordered P2, arrived P4) confirms an actual lead time of 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (21 units) because the P1 order (166 units) has not yet arrived (it should have arrived in P3 if L=2), suggesting a delay or loss for that specific shipment. However, the P2 order arrived on time in P4. We have 432 units in-transit (P1: 166, P3: 266). I will use L=2 (default). For mu_hat, I will use all 9 historical samples to forecast demand (average ~149 * (1+L) = 447). For sigma_hat, I will use a larger N to capture the volatility seen in Period 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top. Current date is 2019-03-18. Looking at historical demand (including pre-game samples): [162, 142, 115, 133, 118, 157, 244, 175, 149, 138]. The mean demand since Period 1 is 172.6, but the 'recent_N' approach will capture the slight stabilization around 140-150. Lead time reconciliation: The order from P1 (166 units) has NOT arrived as of the P5 conclude message, while the P2 order arrived in P4 (L=2). This suggests the P1 order might be lost or significantly delayed, as it is now 4 periods since it was placed. Pipeline inventory: P1(166 - likely lost), P2(arrived), P3(266), P4(0), P5(12). Total in-transit reported is 444 (166+266+12). If P1 is lost, effective pipeline is only 278. On-hand is 0. To ensure service levels, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect recent observations and explicit L=2 as confirmed by the P2 shipment. I will not adjust L higher yet as one missing shipment might be a loss rather than a lead-time shift.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' strap top. Current date is 2019/3/25. Historically, demand has averaged around 140-150 units, but we are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) with 506 units in-transit. A critical observation: the order from Period 1 (166 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised L=2) and has not arrived, suggesting it is lost. The order from Period 2 arrived on time (L=2) and the small order from Period 5 arrived early (L=1). Because the Period 1 shipment is likely lost, the 'pipeline inventory' used by the OR backend is inflated, leading it to under-order. To compensate for the lost 166 units and the stockout, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand of 150 * (1 + L=2) = 450. To offset the lost 166 units in the pipeline calculation, I set mu_hat to 450 + 166 = 616. This forces the backend to place an order despite the 'phantom' units in-transit. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed L=2 and L=1. Sigma remains at recent_N to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (166 units) likely lost; pipeline inventory is currently over-reported by 166 units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1 (Spring). The SKU is a 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics), which typically sees increased demand as weather warms. Demand has been robust, ranging from 115 to 244 units, with a recent mean of approximately 157 units across all periods. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory analysis: Period 1 (166 units) is 7 periods old and promised lead time is 2, so it is confirmed lost. Period 3 (266 units) is now 5 periods old and likely delayed or lost. Period 5 arrived early in Period 6. Period 6 (74 units) and Period 7 (110 units) are within the promised lead time window. Total reliable pipeline is 184 units (Periods 6 & 7). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' (616 units) which includes lost shipments (166 + 266 = 432 units over-reported), I must offset this by increasing mu_hat. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat = (Expected 3-period demand) + (Lost units). Baseline 3-period demand (L+1=3) is ~471 units. Adding the 432 lost units to prevent the backend from under-ordering results in mu_hat of 903. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in actual lead times (1-2 observed).

Carry-over insight: Period 7 update: Period 3 order (266 units) is now 5 periods old (promised 2) and is likely lost; combined with Period 1, total lost pipeline is 432 units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's strap top, which is a seasonal basic. Recent historical demand has spiked significantly: Period 8 demand was 312, compared to a previous mean of ~160. This likely reflects spring seasonality or a promotion. Lead time is highly variable (observed 1 and 2 periods), but several shipments appear lost. Carry-over insights flag Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (266 units) as lost. The current 'In-transit' of 719 includes these 432 lost units, leaving only 287 (from Period 8) as physically in-transit. On-hand is 0. To prevent stockouts during this demand surge, I must compensate for the lost pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current high demand regime (using a mean of ~250 per period, multiplied by L+1=3) while the 'explicit' L of 2 maintains the promised window. However, since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (719) from its base stock calculation, and 432 of those units aren't coming, I will use mu_hat to 'mask' this deficit. Target base stock should be ~750 (3 periods * 250 units). To trigger an order despite the 719 in-transit, I set mu_hat to a value that ensures (base_stock - 719) > 0. Setting mu_hat to 1000 reflects both the demand spike and a buffer for the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 8 demand (312) confirms a significant upward shift in demand regime (approx +80% vs early samples), likely seasonal.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/15. The product is a women's strap top (Everyday Basics), which is entering its peak spring/summer season. Demand has shifted significantly: early periods averaged ~150, but Period 8 saw 312 and Period 9 saw 207 units. Recent 3-period mean is ~235. Regarding inventory, there is a major discrepancy. The OR backend sees 'In-transit: 1000', but history confirms that orders from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (266 units) are lost as they are many weeks past the promised 2-period lead time. This means the backend overestimates pipeline inventory by 432 units. To force the backend to place an order despite this ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock calculation: (L+1) * forecasted demand. With L=2, (2+1) * 235 = 705. To offset the 432 lost units and achieve an order of approximately 250-300 units (to cover upcoming demand), I set mu_hat to 1137 (705 + 432), using the explicit method to override the default backend calculation which is unaware of lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Total lost pipeline inventory is 432 units (P1: 166, P3: 266). Baseline demand regime has shifted from ~150 to ~235 (+56%) as of Period 8 due to spring seasonality.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), we are in the middle of the spring season for 'Strap tops'. Demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the start of the year (Avg periods 8-10: 248 units/week vs early samples: ~150 units/week). Total on-hand is 343 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 569, which includes the Period 10 order (137 units) and the persistent 'ghost' pipeline from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (266 units) that are confirmed lost. Because these 432 units will never arrive, the OR backend's calculated order will be too low if we use the default 'In-transit' value. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to compensate. For mu_hat, I'm setting a target base stock to cover demand over Review+Lead Time (1+2=3 periods). Forecasted weekly demand is 240. 3 * 240 = 720. To adjust for the 432 lost units in pipeline, I am adding 432 to the base stock calculation, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1152. This forces the backend to order enough to ignore the lost stock and meet the actual service level requirements for this seasonal high.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/29. The product is a Women's Jersey Strap Top, which is highly seasonal for Spring/Summer. Demand shifted from a baseline of ~150 to ~235 (+56%) starting Period 8 (April). Recent demand samples (P8-P11: 312, 207, 225, 273) average 254 units. History confirms 432 units are lost (P1: 166, P3: 266). Current inventory status: On-hand 70 + In-transit 809. However, actual productive pipeline is 809 - 432 = 377 units. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its base-stock calculation. Since the backend doesn't know about the 432 lost units, it believes the pipeline is sufficient and will under-order. To force the backend to place an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Forecasted Demand. With L=2, (2+1) * 254 = 762. To account for the 432 invisible lost units, I provide an explicit mu_hat = 762 + 432 = 1194. This bridges the gap caused by the phantom pipeline. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P10) confirm a 1-2 period delivery window is active for recent orders.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-06. The SKU is a 'Strap top/Vest top', which is a seasonal spring/summer item. Demand has significantly increased as we entered April and May, with the last 5 periods (P8-P12) averaging 257.4 units/week, compared to the early-season average of ~150. Specifically, P11 and P12 both saw demand around 270, confirming the 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey top is in its peak seasonal window. Logistics reconciliation: We have 1124 units in-transit. However, based on carry-over insights, orders from P1 (166) and P3 (266) are definitely lost (now 10+ periods old). Total lost pipeline = 432 units. Adjusted effective in-transit = 1124 - 432 = 692 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' (1124) to calculate the order, leading to a massive under-order because it thinks we have 432 units more than we actually do. To force the OR backend to order appropriately, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. Calculations: L=2. Target Base Stock for (L+1)=3 periods should be 3 * 270 = 810 units + safety stock. Effective pipeline is 692. To overcome the 432 unit phantom inventory gap in the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation, I will set mu_hat to approximately (Actual Forecasted Demand for 3 periods + 432). Forecasted mean per period is ~270. 3 * 270 = 810. Explicit mu_hat = 810 + 432 = 1242. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed in the high-demand regime (std of last 5 periods is ~40, so sqrt(3)*40 \u2248 70).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13, 2019. The product is a women's strap top, which is entering peak spring/summer demand. Recent demand (last 6 periods) has averaged 247.6 units, confirming a sustained upward shift from the initial baseline (~150). However, there is significant volatility (recent peak 312, recent low 199). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.5). Crucially, Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (266 units) orders are effectively lost (11+ periods elapsed). Total lost pipeline is 432 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1002 units includes these 432 lost units; therefore, the functional pipeline is 570 units (composed of orders from P12 and P13). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet current demand/seasonality while compensating for the lost inventory it incorrectly thinks is coming, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target mu_hat = (1 + expected_L) * forecast. Using L=2 (promised) and forecast=250, baseline mu_hat is 750. To correct for the 432 units of 'phantom' pipeline, I set mu_hat to 750 + 432 = 1182. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~250 units/period (P8-P13); High volatility observed in spring peak. Functional pipeline is in-transit minus 432 units (P1, P3 lost).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is a women's strap top, which is currently in high seasonal demand as summer approaches. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to early samples: Period 8 (312), Period 9 (207), Period 10 (225), Period 11 (273), Period 12 (270), Period 13 (199), and Period 14 (266). The average demand over these last 7 periods is approximately 250 units, with a standard deviation of about 40. The current 'In-transit' of 826 units includes 432 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost (confirmed over multiple periods); thus, the functional pipeline is 826 - 432 = 394 units. These 394 units relate to orders from Period 13 (118), Period 14 (139), and the backend is processing an order for Period 15 based on the parameters I set. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock and the current demand level. The base stock level needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand + safety stock, minus the functional pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 1182 ((1+L) * 250 + 432) to effectively 'cancel out' the phantom inventory in the backend's calculation.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/27. The product is a women's strap top (Everyday Basic), which has seen elevated demand since early April (Period 8), averaging ~250 units/period (Historical mean for P8-P15 is 252). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1092, but as noted in carry-over insights, P1 (166 units) and P3 (266 units) orders are effectively lost (432 units total). Therefore, functional pipeline = 1092 - 432 = 660 units. These 660 units correspond to orders from P13 (118), P14 (139), and P15 (266), which total only 523 units? Re-checking history: P11 arrived (240), P12 arrived (315). Current In-transit = 1092. Orders outstanding: P1(166), P3(266), P13(118), P14(139), P15(266). Sum = 955. The reported 1092 implies 137 units from P10 are also in-transit/lost? Regardless, the functional pipeline is roughly 523 units (P13-P15). I will use recent_N (N=8, covering the high-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, I will stick with the promised L=2 for the backend calculation.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: Orders from P1 (166), P3 (266), and likely P10 (137) totaling 569 units are overdue/lost. Functional pipeline is roughly 523 units (Orders from P13, P14, P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), we are in the peak summer demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey tops'. Demand has been consistently high, averaging 248 units over the last 9 periods (P8-P16). The critical issue remains broken pipeline visibility. The current 'In-transit' of 1092 reflects orders from P1 (166), P3 (266), P10 (137), P13 (118), P14 (139), and P15 (266). Orders from P1, P3, and P10 are now 16, 14, and 7 periods old respectively against a 2-period promise; these 569 units are confirmed lost. The functional pipeline consists only of P13 (118), P14 (139), and P15 (266), totaling 523 units. With On-hand = 0, we must place an order that addresses the current stockout and caters to the high sustained demand. To overcome the OR backend's over-estimation of pipeline inventory (it sees 1092, but only 523 is real), I will set mu_hat EXPLICITLY. The goal is a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1 review period) at ~250/period plus a safety buffer. Target base stock = 3 * 250 + 1.5 * 50 = ~825. Since the backend thinks we have 1092 in transit, it will order nothing unless mu_hat is set high enough to trigger an order. To bridge the 569-unit gap, I set mu_hat to 1394 (Target 825 + lost 569).

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Total confirmed lost pipeline is 569 units (P1: 166, P3: 266, P10: 137). Functional pipeline is 523 units. Demand remains stable at approx 250 units/period for summer season.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18 (June 10). The product is 'Womens Everyday Basics Jersey top', which sees sustained high demand during the spring and summer. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 250 units/period (average of P13-P17 is ~241). The primary challenge is a significant amount of lost/overdue pipeline inventory: Orders from P1 (166), P3 (266), and P10 (137) totaling 569 units have never arrived and are now too old to be expected. While 'In-transit' shows 1128 units, the functional pipeline is effectively 1128 - 569 = 559 units (consisting of orders from P13, P14, P15, and P17). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high reported in-transit number, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) at 250 units/period (~750 units) plus a buffer for volatility. Setting mu_hat to 1100 (explicit) ensures the OR engine calculation (base_stock - reported_pipeline) results in a positive order to replenish the low (54) on-hand stock and replace the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation confirmed at Period 18: Total lost units = 569 (P1: 166, P3: 266, P10: 137). Functional pipeline is current 'In-Transit' minus 569. Demand remains stable for summer season at ~250 units/period.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/6/17), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics' vest top. The on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1,128 units, but based on historical tracking (Carry-over insights), 569 units from Periods 1, 3, and 10 are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from Period 13 (118 units) and Period 14 (139 units) are now significantly overdue (6 and 5 periods respectively), while the promised lead time is 2. Including these as likely lost, the 'functional pipeline' only consists of the orders from Period 17 (302 units). This leaves us heavily undersupplied against a demand regime that, despite a single low outlier in Period 18 (92), has averaged ~250 units/period since Period 8. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am significantly increasing mu_hat. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period coverage of ~750 units plus a safety buffer, while effectively 'cancelling out' the phantom inventory in the OR engine's logic (In-transit - Lost Units). Given the profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, the service level target is 50%, but with current stockouts, a higher mu_hat is required to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Order from P13 (118 units) and P14 (139 units) are now considered lost/indefinitely delayed (6+ periods since order). Total estimated lost pipeline increased from 569 to 826 units. Functional pipeline is currently 302 units (from P17). Demand regime remains estimated at ~250 units/period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is June 24, 2019 (Period 20). Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (P18: 92, P19: 85) from the previous summer average of ~250 units/period. This suggests a post-peak retail drop or a seasonal shift for this 'Everyday Basics' strap top. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent low-demand regime (N=3 includes the last stable period and the two recent low periods). Regarding inventory, the Carry-over Insights (COI) indicate a pattern of lost shipments: P1 (166), P3 (266), P10 (137), P13 (118), and P14 (139) for a total of 826 lost units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 1500 units. Functional pipeline = 1500 - 826 = 674 units (consisting of orders from P17 and P19). Since the backend OR engine is unaware of lost shipments, it believes pipeline inventory is 1500; I will use L=default and adjust mu_hat/sigma_hat to encourage sufficient ordering given the 0 on-hand inventory and the actual vs reported pipeline gap. However, since the internal logic uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the over-reported pipeline of 826 units will prevent the OR system from ordering unless base_stock is very high. To mitigate this without knowing the exact cap, I will set mu_hat using the recent lower demand to avoid over-ordering during a potential downtrend while acknowledging the risk of stockouts due to the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: mean demand decreased from ~250 to ~88 (-65%) following early summer peak. Total confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed units: 826 (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), demand has entered a significant downward shift (mean ~80 units/period since Period 18) following the spring/early summer peak. The product is a 'Strap top', which typically sees peak demand in late spring and early summer; we are now past that peak. Pipeline reconciliation is critical: historical 'In-transit' data includes several lost shipments (P1: 166, P3: 266, P10: 137, P13: 118, P14: 139) totaling 826 units that never arrived. Additionally, the orders from P17 (302) and P19 (372) totaling 674 units should have arrived by now (promised L=2). Given 'In-transit' is 1500 units, and (lost 826 + overdue 674 = 1500), it effectively means we have no functional pipeline about to arrive in the next period, and on-hand is 0. However, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic will subtract 1500 from the base_stock calculation. To prevent the backend from ordering 0 units due to this phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current low demand regime (~80/period) over (L+1) periods, but I must also address the phantom inventory. Since I cannot change the backend's 'In-transit' view, I use mu_hat to ensure the base_stock (mu_hat + safety) is high enough to trigger an order despite the 1500 unit 'pipeline'. Demand for last 3 periods: 92, 85, 61 (Mean ~79). Calculation: I want an order of ~240 (3 periods of coverage). Target Base Stock = Pipeline (1500) + Order (240) = 1740. I will set mu_hat to 1740 to force the backend to place an order to cover the current demand gap.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed units updated to 1500 (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Current high 'In-transit' value is entirely phantom inventory. Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: avg ~80 units/period (-68% vs spring peak).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-08. Demand has shifted significantly downward since Period 18 (June 10), averaging approximately 66 units/period (92, 85, 61, 27) as we move deeper into the summer. The prior demand regime was ~250. The in-transit inventory of 1740 units is severely compromised by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms that orders from P1 (166), P3 (266), P10 (137), P13 (118), P14 (139), P17 (302), and P19 (372) are all overdue beyond the promised 2-period lead time and have not arrived, totaling 1500 units. The functional in-transit inventory is therefore 1740 - 1500 = 240 units (the order from P21). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 captures the new low-demand regime (avg ~66). Lead time is set to default (2), but mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted via explicit/recent methods to account for the current demand reality. Because functional pipeline (240) already exceeds the required base stock for this low-demand phase (approx 3*66 = 198), the OR backend will correctly place a zero order despite the high 'phantom' in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed units updated to 1500 (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand regime in July is confirmed low (avg < 70 units/period) following the spring/early summer peak.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for this summer 'Strap top' has dropped significantly, confirming the regime shift observed since Period 18. Last 5 periods demand: 92, 85, 61, 27, 21 (average ~57). Recent 3 periods: 61, 27, 21 (average ~36). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining some safety. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect current lower volatility. The 'In-transit' value of 1740 is almost entirely composed of lost or perpetually delayed shipments (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P21) totaling 1740 units. Specifically, P21 (240 units) is now at its promised lead time but the track record of this SKU suggests high loss rates. Since functional pipeline is effectively zero and on-hand is zero, I will continue to place small orders using 'explicit' L=2 to attempt to trigger arrivals, even though historical performance indicates severe reliability issues. The backend will calculate base stock based on the low demand regime, helping to minimize holding costs if items finally arrive.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed units updated to 1740 (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P21). Functional pipeline is zero. July demand avg ~36 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics 'Jersey Basic' strap top) has dropped significantly in July, averaging 32 units/period over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), down from a spring peak of ~250. This aligns with mid-summer clearance or end-of-season behavior for basics. Regarding inventory, the system reports 'In-transit: 1500 units', but historical analysis confirms these are almost entirely lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19 total 1740 units, but many were offset by the arrive/order logic in the engine). As of P23 conclude, the P21 order of 240 units arrived, leaving the 1500 'In-transit' units as phantom inventory that will never arrive. Because holding costs are high ($1.0/unit/period) and current on-hand (221) already covers ~7 periods of current demand (~32/period), I must stop ordering. By setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) and mu_hat to a low 'recent_N' value based on the last 4 periods (N=4), the base_stock will fall below my current on-hand + (perceived) pipeline, resulting in a zero order. Even though the backend sees 1500 in transit, the low demand forecast will naturally cap the order at 0.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime for jersey basics confirmed low: avg ~32 units/period (P20-P23). Total 'In-transit' of 1500 units remains confirmed as lost/phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for 'Strap top' (Womens Everyday Basics) has undergone a significant regime shift. After the spring/early summer peak (avg ~250 units), demand in July has dropped drastically to an average of ~21 units/period over the last 4 periods (P21-P24: 27, 21, 19, 18). Existing on-hand inventory is 203 units, which covers approximately 9.6 periods of current demand. Regarding the 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units: historical evidence confirms these are lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, and P19. The order from P21 arrived normally in P23 (L=2). The system has 1500 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders or being blocked by the cap, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current mid-summer low-demand regime (~21 units/period). With 203 on-hand, the base stock (approx 63 for L=2) will be well below current stock, resulting in zero new orders, which is appropriate given the seasonal decline.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) is significantly lower than spring peak, averaging ~21 units/period (P21-P24). Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 1500 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's jersey vest top, which experienced a significant demand peak during the spring (late March to early June) and has since transitioned into a low-volume mid-summer regime. Current demand observations for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) are: 27, 21, 19, 18, 27, averaging approximately 22.4 units per period. This represents a confirmed regime shift from the ~250 units/period seen in spring to ~22 units/period now. On-hand inventory is 176 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 8 weeks of sales. The 'In-transit' value of 1500 units remains entirely composed of lost or indefinitely delayed orders from earlier periods (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19), as confirmed by historical gaps. Given the high on-hand stock relative to the current low demand rate, no further ordering is required. Setting mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 to reflect the stable low-demand summer regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Strap top/Everyday Basic', which has moved into a low-demand mid-summer regime (August). Over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), demand has plummeted to an average of approximately 21.3 units per period (27, 21, 19, 18, 27, 16), compared to the spring peak of ~250. Current on-hand inventory is 160 units, which covers approximately 7-8 weeks of current demand. As documented in previous periods, the 1500 units 'In-transit' are confirmed as lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19), meaning functional pipeline inventory is zero. However, given the significant stock on-hand relative to the current low demand (160 units vs ~21 demand), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this lower demand regime and use explicit L=2 to reflect the promised lead time, allowing the OR backend to see that on-hand inventory comfortably exceeds the base stock level.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 19, 2019. The SKU is a 'Strap top/Womens Everyday Basic'. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal pattern: a high spring peak (~250 units/period between P8-P17) followed by a sharp decline in summer. Since Period 20, demand has averaged approximately 25 units per period. The most recent samples (P24-P27) show 18, 27, 16, and 12 units, indicating a further softening to ~18 units/period as we progress through late summer. On-hand inventory is 148 units, which, at current demand levels, provides over 8 periods of coverage. Regarding the supply chain, there is a persistent 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units consisting of multiple lost orders from Period 1 through Period 19. These are ignored for planning. Since on-hand inventory is significantly higher than the expected demand for the review and lead time (1+2=3 periods), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime using the last 7 periods (approx 30 units/period) and sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Late summer demand regime (August) confirmed very low: avg ~18 units/period (P24-P27). On-hand inventory provides excessive coverage for current demand levels.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. This SKU (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey Strap Top) is in a significant post-summer seasonal decline. Recent demand (P24-P28) has consistently been very low, averaging approximately 17 units per period. The on-hand inventory of 137 units is more than sufficient to cover demand for the foreseeable future (approx 8 periods of coverage), especially as we move further away from the spring/summer peak. The 'In-transit' count of 1500 units is confirmed as phantom/lost inventory from multiple historical periods (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) and should be ignored for logic. I am setting parameters to reflect this low-demand regime (recent_N=5) and using the default lead time. No new orders are needed; the focus is on depleting existing on-hand stock to minimize holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/9/2 (Early September). Historical demand analysis confirms a significant decline from the spring peak (~250 units/period) to a summer low. The most recent demand samples (P24-P29: 18, 27, 16, 12, 11, 7) show a mean of ~15 units/period. The SKU is a 'Strap top', which is seasonal. As we enter September, demand remains extremely low compared to the on-hand inventory of 130 units. At current consumption rates, 130 units provides over 8 weeks of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units is confirmed as phantom/lost inventory from multiple previous periods (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) and should be ignored for planning. Since on-hand inventory (130) is much higher than the base stock level needed for a demand of ~15/period (which would be ~45-60 units), no new orders should be placed. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 samples to reflect this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Late Summer/Early Autumn) continues the low-demand trend observed in August: avg ~15 units/period (P24-P29).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for women's jersey basic strap tops has plummeted following the spring/early summer peak, stabilizing at a very low level for the late summer/early autumn season. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged approximately 10.4 units per period, with a clear downward trend (16, 12, 11, 7, 6). The current on-hand inventory is 124 units. With demand now under 10 units per week, the current stock provides over 12 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units is confirmed as phantom/lost inventory (orders from P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, etc., which never arrived). No new orders are needed; the primary goal is to minimize holding costs while liquidating existing excess stock. I will set mu_hat to be very low based on the most recent 7 samples (approx 15 units per period including the lead time) to ensure the OR backend does not place additional orders.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Autumn transition) continues to decline: avg ~8.5 units/period (P28-P30) vs ~18 units/period in August.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019), the demand for this 'Everyday Basics' jersey strap top is in a deep seasonal trough following the spring/summer peak. Recent demand samples for September (Periods 30-31) show 6 and 4 units respectively, confirming a continued decline from the August average (~11 units). The inventory position is extremely long: on-hand inventory is 120 units, while current demand is averaging < 10 units/period. The 1500 units in-transit are confirmed as phantom/lost pipeline inventory (orders from P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) and should be ignored for replenishment logic. Given that on-hand inventory provides over 12 periods of coverage at current demand levels, I will continue to set parameters to suppress ordering. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent late-summer/early-autumn demand collapse (~6 units/period).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. We are in a consistent low-demand regime for 'Strap tops' as the autumn season progresses. Recent demand (P28-P32) has been minimal (11, 7, 6, 4, 3), averaging ~6.2 units per period with a clear downward trend. On-hand inventory is 117 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 18 periods\u2014far exceeding the promised lead time of 2. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units is confirmed as phantom inventory from lost/undelivered orders (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) and should be ignored for planning. Because on-hand inventory is significantly higher than required to meet the 95% service level for the upcoming review + lead time periods, no new orders are necessary. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this extremely low-volume regime and prevent the OR backend from triggering orders, while maintaining a default lead time parameter.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime (Autumn transition) has reached a seasonal floor: avg ~4.3 units/period (P30-P32). Excess on-hand inventory (117 units) covers all foreseeable demand through the season end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-111.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Strap top' (Women's Everyday Basics) has effectively bottomed out as it enters the off-season (October). Recent demand data from Period 31 to 33 shows a consistent decline (4, 3, 3 units), averaging ~3.3 units per period. The current on-hand inventory of 114 units remains extremely high relative to this seasonal floor, providing over 30 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units is confirmed phantom inventory from multiple lost shipments earlier in the year and should be ignored for replenishment logic. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $1.0, and the massive overstock position, the objective is to prevent any further orders while the system sells through existing stock. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit low value representing the current seasonal demand to ensure the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) stays well below the current on-hand inventory level.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 7, 2019. The SKU is a 'Jersey Basic' vest top, which is entering a late autumn/winter seasonal trough. Demand has decreased steadily from its spring/summer peak and has now stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 4.3 units per period over the last five weeks (P30-P34). On-hand inventory is 107 units, which provides over 20 periods of coverage at current demand levels. There is 1500 units of 'In-transit' inventory, all of which has been previously identified as 'phantom' or lost pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, and P21). Because the phantom pipeline is much larger than any calculated base stock and the on-hand inventory is already excessive, the goal is to prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders. Setting mu_hat to a very low explicit value based on recent demand (~4.3 units * 3 periods = 12.9) ensures the base stock remains far below the on-hand inventory level.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is October 14, 2019 (Period 36). The product is a 'Strap top', which is seasonally a summer item. Demand has reached a seasonal floor, with the last 6 periods (P30-P35) averaging approximately 4.3 units per period (6, 4, 3, 3, 7, 3). On-hand inventory is currently 104 units, which at the current burn rate covers more than 20 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory from orders placed earlier in the year (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19) that were never delivered and are confirmed lost. Because on-hand inventory is significantly higher than any reasonable base stock level calculated from current low demand (\u03bc\u0302 \u2248 4.3 over L+1 periods), no new orders are required. The OR backend will naturally set the order to zero as long as the base_stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) is less than the on-hand inventory. I will set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using a recent window of 6 periods to reflect the stable, low autumn demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues in a very low-demand late autumn regime. Recent demand (P33-P36: 3, 7, 3, 5) averages approximately 4.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory of 99 units is massive relative to this requirement, providing over 20 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units remains high only because multiple historical orders (notably from periods 1, 3, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 19) never arrived and are effectively lost; no new orders have arrived since Period 23. Given the $1.00 holding cost per unit and the low current demand, the priority remains to deplete existing inventory and avoid any further ordering. I will set the demand forecast using the most recent 5 periods (avg ~4 units) to reflect the stabilized seasonal floor and keep the lead time at default to ensure the OR backend correctly identifies that on-hand inventory is far in excess of the safety stock requirements.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the SKU (Womens Everyday Basics strap top) is in a definitive seasonal low. Demand has stabilized at extremely low levels, averaging approximately 4 units per period since Period 33. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, which at the current burn rate provides over 20 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' balance of 1500 units remains high only due to the accrual of lost/missing shipments from earlier in the year (as detailed in carry-over insights), and there is no evidence of these shipments arriving. Given the high holding cost ($1.00) relative to profit ($1.00), the priority is to avoid any new orders and slowly deplete the existing surplus inventory. OR parameters are set to reflect this minimal demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation does not trigger an order against the phantom pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 (Womens Everyday Basics strap top) is in a very low demand regime (Autumn/Winter transition), following a significant spring peak. Current demand over the last 9 periods (P30-P38) averages approximately 4.7 units per period. The 1500 units in-transit are confirmed lost/phantom inventory from earlier periods (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19), meaning the functional pipeline is zero. With 88 units on-hand, the current inventory provides over 18 periods of coverage at current demand rates. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), and the fact that we are approaching the final 8 periods of the game (ending P47), the primary goal is to deplete existing stock rather than place new orders. I will set the demand parameters using the most recent 10-period regime to accurately reflect the current seasonal floor.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/11 (Period 40). We are in a late autumn/pre-winter season for a 'Strap top' (Jersey Basic), which is historically a low-demand period. Observed demand from Period 31 to 39 has been extremely low, averaging approximately 4.4 units per period (range 3-8). On-hand inventory is currently 84 units, which provides over 19 periods of coverage at current demand rates. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1500 units continues to be identified as phantom/lost inventory from previous periods (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, etc.), and given that the game ends at Period 47, no new orders are necessary. I will set parameters to ensure no further orders are triggered by the OR backend. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current low-demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18 (Period 41). The SKU is a 'Strap top', a jersey basic garment. Demand has hit a seasonal floor during the autumn/winter transition, consistently averaging ~4-5 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P31-P40). Current on-hand inventory is 80 units, providing approximately 16-20 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units remains confirmed as phantom inventory from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P21), as documented in carry-over insights. Total profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), implying a target service level of 50%. Given the significant excess inventory relative to current demand and the closeness to the game end (Period 47), no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime to prevent the OR backend from attempting to reconcile the phantom 'In-transit' gap with more orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 108775044 (Jersey basic strap top) is in a very low demand phase (late November). Demand has been consistently below 10 units per period since September. Specifically, for Periods 34-41, demand has averaged ~4.6 units. With 77 units currently on-hand, the inventory position provides approximately 16+ periods of coverage, which is more than sufficient for the remaining 6 periods of the game. The 1500 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from over 20 periods ago). Given the high level of excess inventory and the seasonally low demand for this basic vest top in winter, no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect this low-demand regime and to ensure the backend does not place unnecessary orders due to the phantom pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 2nd (Period 43). Historical demand for this 'Jersey top' has remained extremely low throughout the autumn and early winter, with demand in the last 5 periods (P38-P42) averaging 5.8 units per week. The current on-hand inventory of 67 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (43, 44, 45, 46, 47) at this demand rate. The 1500 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory from lost/undelivered orders earlier in the year (P1, P3, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19). No new orders are needed. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime to prevent the OR backend from attempting to replenish against the phantom pipeline. \u03bc\u0302 is set using a recent N=10 to capture the stable low demand since late September.

Carry-over insight: December demand remains at seasonal floor (~5-6 units/period). On-hand inventory of 67 units is sufficient to cover all remaining periods of the game.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (December 9th), the demand for this 'Jersey Basic' top remains at its seasonal floor, averaging approximately 5-6 units per period over the last 10 weeks. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (44-47), the current on-hand inventory of 65 units is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Total demand through the end of the game is estimated to be ~20-25 units, leaving a significant surplus. No further orders are required. The 'In-transit' figure of 1500 units continues to be identified as phantom inventory from lost/delayed orders early in the game (Periods 1, 3, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19). I will maintain the current parameters but the OR engine will not place orders given the high on-hand relative to the target base stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 (mid-December), only 3 periods away from the game's conclusion at Period 47. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Strap Top', which experienced a significant demand peak during the spring and early summer (March\u2013June) but has remained at a seasonal 'floor' since September. Demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 30) has averaged approximately 4.7 units per period, with a maximum of 10. Our current on-hand inventory is 61 units. Given that the total remaining demand across the final three periods (P45, P46, P47) is expected to be roughly 15-20 units, our existing inventory is more than sufficient to achieve a 100% service level. Any new order placed now would not arrive until Period 47 (L=2) and would simply incur unnecessary holding costs, especially considering the 1500 units of lost/phantom pipeline inventory already recorded in history. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 15-period regime to reflect the low winter demand, while relying on the existing on-hand stock to satisfy all remaining requirements without further ordering.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (December 23, 2019), which is the penultimate period of the game (total 47 periods). The product is a jersey basic strap top, which experienced a significant seasonal peak in Spring/Early Summer and has since settled into a very low late-autumn/winter demand regime. Recent demand (P40-P45) has averaged approximately 5 units per period. On-hand inventory is currently 54 units, which is more than ten times the current weekly demand. With only one period remaining after this decision, existing stock is more than sufficient to cover all possible demand until the game ends. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1500 units remains confirmed as 'phantom' or lost inventory from much earlier in the year and does not impact physical availability. To prevent unnecessary holding costs and ensure no further orders are placed, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current low demand floor and use the 'explicit' method for L to mirror the promised lead time without triggering backend adjustments based on the lost shipments.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Final Period). The product is a jersey basic strap top, which is currently in a very low-demand seasonal trough (approx. 4-7 units/period). On-hand inventory is 43 units, which is more than enough to cover demand for the final period (Period 47). The 1500 units in-transit are confirmed lost/phantom inventory from earlier in the year and do not represent actual incoming stock. Given that this is the final period and inventory is sufficient, no further orders are necessary. I will maintain the methods used in previous periods to reflect the low demand and stable lead time, but the OR engine's logic will result in a zero order as on-hand (>40) exceeds the required base stock for this low-demand regime.
