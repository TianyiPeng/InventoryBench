Historically (from provided samples), we see demand in early January and early February ranging from 42 to 56 units. The most recent sample (2019-02-04) was 42 units. The current date is February 11, 2019, which is the week leading up to Valentine's Day (Feb 14). We should expect a significant demand spike for lingerie this week. Based on the baseline average of ~45-50, I will forecast a spike to ~80-100 units for this week. Given a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods, my order today (N=1) should cover demand for Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods) because the arrival only occurs at the end of Period 3 (arrival resolution). Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to order enough to cover the Valentine's spike plus subsequent weeks. Assuming demand: P1: 90 (Valentine week), P2: 50, P3: 45. Total = 185 units. I will order 200 units to ensure service level and build a small safety stock, especially since I start with nothing.",

Demand Regime: The most recent demand figures (P4: 34, P5: 25, P6: 30) confirm a stable post-holiday mean of approximately 30 units/period. Lead Time Analysis: Lead times are inconsistent. P2 arrived in 2 periods (L=2), P5 arrived in 1 period (L=1), while P1 and P3 appear lost or significantly delayed. I must assume a lead time of 2 periods for planning to cover demand during the order-to-arrival gap. Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand is 30. Recent demand is 30. Expected demand for P7 is ~30, meaning on-hand will be depleted to 0 at the end of this period. Pipeline: In-transit is 300 units (representing P1, P3, and P6). If P1 and P3 are truly lost, the only viable incoming shipment is P6 (50 units), likely arriving in P7 or P8. My target pipeline (L+1 periods) is ~90-100 units.

The 'In-transit' figure of 325 units is deceptive: 250 units (P1=200, P3=50) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. The viable pipeline consists of P12 (25 units ordered 2 periods ago) and P13 (50 units ordered 1 period ago). Based on the L=2 promise, the P12 order should arrive this period (P14), but we cannot rely on it until P15. Current demand is estimated at ~35 units/period for this May seasonal phase. To cover the next 3 periods (P14-P16) allowing for L+1 logic (35 * 3 = 105 total needed) against a viable pipeline of 75 (25+50), a deficit of 30 units exists. I will order 50 units to provide a safety buffer against the stockout currently occurring and to account for potential shipment losses seen historically.",

Current demand is tracking at approximately 130-150 units/period (weighted average of P39-40), a significant step up from the ~100 units/period seen in October. The 'In-transit' of 1700 units is heavily inflated by 1200 units of confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P33, P34). The viable pipeline consists of orders from P38 (150 units), P39 (300 units), and P40 (350 units), totaling 800 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, causing stockouts despite high demand. Given the supplier's ~35% loss rate and variable lead times (1-3 periods), I must continue aggressive ordering to rebuild a buffer and cover the holiday peak. Forecasting 150 units/period for the next 3 periods (L+1) requires 450 units. With 800 viable units in the pipeline and 0 on-hand, the pipeline theoretically covers the mean, but high volatility and loss risk necessitate an additional order of 250 units to mitigate the current stockout streak and ensure service levels for late November.",

Lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods), and the supplier loss rate remains a significant factor (estimated ~30% based on 1200 units confirmed lost to date). Period 41 ended with 172 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' is 1650, but we must exclude the 1200 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P33, P34), leaving a viable pipeline of 450 units (P38: 150 - likely lost or severely delayed as P39 arrived first, P40: 350, P41: 250). Since P39 arrived in Period 41 but P38 did not, P38 (150 units) is now categorized as likely lost. Effective viable pipeline is 600 units (P40, P41). To cover the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods) at a holiday demand of ~150-180 units/period plus safety stock for supplier unreliability, we target an inventory position of ~600 units across the next 3 weeks.

Historically, December demand for lingerie often remains relatively high but can be volatile. Given on-hand inventory is high at 534 units, and the pipeline contains 1,500 units (though 1,350 are confirmed/likely lost based on the carry-over history), we must focus on viable stock. The 'viable' pipeline effectively consists of P42 (200 units, L=2) and P43 (250 units, L=2). On-hand inventory (534) covers ~4 periods of the current high-end demand (approx 130-150 units). However, the supplier loss rate is extremely high (~30-40%).

On-hand inventory is strong at 451 units, which covers over 5 periods of recent average demand (~80), but only about 2.5-3 periods of peak holiday demand (~150-180).

Historical demand from early Jan-Feb 2019 was in the 40-60 range. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 814 units due to the arrival of 450 units in P45. With only one period remaining (Game 47/47) after this decision, and given the holding cost of $1/unit vs. a profit of $19/unit, carrying excessive inventory into the final period is a significant risk. Any order placed now (P46) with a lead time of 1-3 periods will likely arrive in P47 or later.
