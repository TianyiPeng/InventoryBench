Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) show a relatively stable mean: [42, 56, 47, 42, 42], averaging 45.8 per week. The product is a 'Lace push-up body' lingerie item. As we are currently in February, we are approaching the Valentine's Day retail period (Feb 14th), which historically drives demand in the lingerie category. Given that this is our first decision and we have zero inventory (on-hand + in-transit), we must establish a base stock levels immediately. I will use the promised lead time of 2 periods (L=2) and use all 5 historical samples to calculate mean and standard deviation. The OR backend will use these to determine the initial order, accounting for the 3-period coverage requirement (L+1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a lace push-up body (Womens Lingerie). Looking at the provided historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand was stable between 42-56 units. However, in Period 1 (Feb 11), we saw a spike to 63, and the status for Period 2 indicates a current demand context or period number near 47 (though the '47' in the prompt is ambiguous, historical mean is approx 46). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory because the initial order of 56 placed in P1 has not arrived yet. With a promised lead time of 2, we expect the P1 order to arrive at the start of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We lost sales in Period 1 because we started with 0 inventory. To set parameters: 1) L is set to default (promised 2). 2) Mu_hat: The mean of the 5 pre-game samples is 45.8. Including Period 1 (63), the mean is 48.6. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent higher demand. This will calculate (1+2)*48.6 = 145.8. 3) Sigma_hat: Using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent volatility (std dev of {42, 56, 47, 42, 42, 63} is ~8.4, so sigma_hat \u2248 1.73 * 8.4 \u2248 14.5). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers lead time + review period demand with a safety buffer.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Feb 25, 2019. The product is a lace push-up body (lingerie), which often sees demand spikes around Valentine's Day. Looking at historical demand, we've seen a sharp increase: from a baseline of ~42-47 in Jan to 63 (P1) and 68 (P2) in Feb. We are currently out of stock (on-hand 0) with a pipeline of 120 units (56 ordered P1, 64 ordered P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (ordered Feb 11) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (making it visible in P3 conclude / P4 start). No orders have concluded yet, so we stick to the promised lead time L=2. To capture the recent Feb demand increase for mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 (mean of 63 and 68 = 65.5). mu_hat = (1+L) * 65.5 = 3 * 65.5 = 196.5. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=2 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a piece of women's lingerie with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. Status: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 192. Promised lead time is 2. Historical demand samples: 42, 56, 47, 42, 42 (Mean ~46). Observed demand since start: P1=63, P2=68, P3=28 (Mean ~53). Current demand is slightly higher than the initial samples but highly variable. Observation on arrivals: P1 order (56 units) was placed at the start of P1. With L=2, it should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in 'Period 3 conclude' (read at P4 start). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely 3 periods (expecting arrival in P4, visible in P5) or the shipment is delayed/lost. I will set L to 3 to reflect this observation and adjust mu_hat to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the overall volatility including the recent high-demand peaks. Pipeline inventory (192) already covers expected demand, so these parameters will likely result in a small or zero order this period depending on the OR backend's cap.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). The SKU is a lace push-up body (Womens Lingerie). Current inventory is 30 units on-hand with 192 units in-transit. From the history, we see that the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods is currently accurate. The order from Period 1 (56 units) has not yet arrived (it would have been 3 periods late if it arrived now). Since the P2 order arrived on time (P2+2=P4) but P1 (due at P3) did not, P1 is likely a lost shipment. Historical demand shows a peak in early February (60s) followed by a drop in late February/early March (28-34). For Period 5, I will use a conservative average of the last 4 periods (68, 28, 34, plus a small buffer for the initial high demand) to set the base stock. I will use recent_N=4 for demand to capture this recent range while acknowledging the lost units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (56 units) likely lost: P2 order (placed later) arrived on time in P4, but P1 has not arrived by P5.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). Examining the history: Period 1's order (56 units) has still not arrived, while Period 2's order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. This confirms the carry-over insight that the Period 1 shipment is likely lost. Current on-hand inventory is low (5 units), and there is a total of 192 units in-transit (Orders from P3, P4, and P5). The demand has shown a downward trend since the initial peaks in February: P1: 63, P2: 68, P3: 28, P4: 34, P5: 25. The mean of the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is approximately 29. Given the promised lead time (L=2), we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat captures the recent lower demand level (approx 29 * 3 = 87) better than the global mean which is inflated by the February spike. I will use the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline, as the one arrival we've seen (P2) adhered to it.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 192 units in-transit. Reviewing the history: The Period 1 order (56 units) is officially confirmed as lost, as it has not arrived by Period 6 while the Period 2 order arrived on time. The Period 3 order (72 units) was placed on 2019-02-25 and, with a promised lead time of 2, should have arrived in Period 5; its absence suggests it is also delayed or lost. Orders from Period 4 (64 units) are expected in Period 6 (visible in Period 7), but the 'Starting on-hand' for Period 7 is 0, implying either it hasn't arrived or was consumed immediately. However, the game mechanism states we see arrivals in the 'Period N conclude' message at the start of N+1. Since Period 6 conclude shows 0 arrived, the Period 3 and Period 4 orders are delayed. Demand has stabilized: early samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~46, while recent samples (P1-P6) average ~41. The product (Lace push-up body) has no immediate seasonal spike in late March. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays, and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the slightly lower recent demand volatility. Setting L=3 increases the base stock to cover the longer pipeline risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Supply chain instability confirmed; Period 3 order (72 units) is overdue (over 4 periods since order), indicating a recurring risk of lost or significantly delayed shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 1st, 2019 (Period 8). We are managing a women's lace push-up body. Demand started high (avg ~65 in P1-P2) but has settled into a lower regime (avg ~29 in P3-P7). The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from P1 and P3 are officially considered lost or severely delayed (P3 is now 5 periods old), while only the P2 order arrived on time (L=2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 228 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, P7, and any auto-generated ones). However, since P1 (56 units) and P3 (72 units) are likely lost, our effective pipeline is only ~100 units. To compensate for this risk and avoid further stockouts, I am setting L=3 to increase the base stock level (safety buffer). For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower post-launch regime (~29 units/period) rather than the initial spike. This combination aims to build enough stock to survive missing shipments while not over-ordering for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Recurring shipment loss confirmed. Effective pipeline excludes P1 (56) and P3 (72) units. Demand stabilized at ~29 units/week from P3-P7.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing SKU 487722001 (Women's Lingerie). Current Period 9 decision follows Period 8 conclude. History analysis shows: 1) Demand Regime: Initial high demand (Periods 1-2, mean ~65) shifted to a lower, stable regime (Periods 3-8, mean ~28.3). 2) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. Observed lead times are 2 (P2 order) and 1 (P7 order). 3) Lost Shipments: Orders from P1 (56 units) and P3 (72 units) are overdue by 8 and 6 periods respectively, confirming they are lost. The backend OR engine counts these 128 lost units in 'pipeline_inventory', leading to massive under-ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include current demand plus the lost inventory that must be replenished. Mean demand is ~28.3. Pipeline correction: 128 units needed over the (L+1) horizon. Calculating mu_hat: (L+1)*28.3 + 128 \u2248 213. Sigma_hat is set to 20 to provide buffer against demand variability and supply instability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are facing significant supply chain instability. Historical evidence shows that orders from Period 1 (56 units) and Period 3 (72 units) are likely lost, as they have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2 periods and the fact that later orders (Period 2 and Period 7) have already concluded. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has cooled from the high initial samples (avg ~60) to a more stable regime (avg ~26.4 over the last 7 periods, P3-P9). This item (a lace push-up body) may have experienced a peak during the Valentine's Day period (February) and is now in a lower-demand spring phase. The OR backend needs to account for the lost stock in the pipeline. Since the backend treats all in-transit units as viable, and 128 units (P1: 56 + P3: 72) are likely non-existent, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively 'over-order' to compensate for the phantom pipeline. Expected demand is ~26/week. Accounting for lead time (L=2) and the current period (+1), and the depletion of the 128 units, I set mu_hat to 190 to force the backend to place an order that refills the stock despite the false 'in-transit' count. L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed lead times of 1 and 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Product demand remains stable in the lower regime (avg 26.4 since P3), significantly lower than the P1-P2 initial burst (~65). Lost shipment of 128 total units (P1, P3) remains unrecovered and must be compensated for in order calculations.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), the product 'Charlotte Body Push Melbourne' (Women's Lingerie) has transitioned into a stable lower demand regime following an initial burst. Since Period 3, demand has averaged approximately 24.8 units per week (28, 34, 25, 30, 28, 25, 19, 16), which is significantly lower than the early February peak. We are also dealing with severe supply chain instability: the shipments ordered in Period 1 (56 units) and Period 3 (72 units) are over 8 and 10 periods old, respectively, and are considered lost. These 128 units still appear in the 'In-transit' figure of 192 (along with the 64 units ordered in Period 4 which were delivered, and the 64 units ordered in Period 2 which were delivered). Wait, checking history: P2 (64) arrived in P4. P7 (36) arrived in P8. P9 (43) arrived in P10. The 'In-transit' of 192 likely comprises the lost P1 (56) and P3 (72) plus potentially recent orders not yet showing. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock to determine the order, I must set mu_hat high enough to 'offset' the 128 ghost units that will never arrive, ensuring the policy actually triggers an order to meet future demand. I use N=8 for demand to capture the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Stable at ~25 units/week since Period 3. Two lost shipments total 128 units (P1: 56, P3: 72) which artificially inflate the pipeline inventory, requiring manual compensation in mu_hat/sigma_hat to maintain stock availability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 3, averaging approximately 24 units per week over the last 9 periods (P3-P11). The initial high demand in P1-P2 (avg 65.5) appears to be a launch spike. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 193 units, but 128 of these are from Period 1 (56 units) and Period 3 (72 units), which are confirmed as lost shipments due to being significantly overdue (9+ and 11+ periods respectively). The true 'effective' pipeline is only 65 units (from P11 and P12-equivalent logic). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to restore stock despite the inflated pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the formula: base_stock = (1+L) * mu. With L=2, and a stabilized demand mu of 24, base_stock should be ~72. Recognizing the 128 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I need to set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - (effective_pipeline + 128)' yields a positive order. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a base stock that covers the stabilized demand plus the lost volume (Net mu per period ~ 24 + 43 = 67). Setting L to 2 (promised).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product (Charlotte Body Push Melbourne) is experiencing a mismatch between demand and available stock due to lost shipments and an underestimated lead-time buffer. Demand since Period 3 has averaged 26.8 units/week, with Period 12 showing a significant spike to 47 units, likely due to early May seasonality or a promotion. We have confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (56 units) and Period 3 (72 units), totaling 128 units that are still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 214. Correcting for these, the 'effective' pipeline is 86 units (Orders from P11 and P12). On-hand inventory is 0. To protect against the demonstrated supply chain instability (lost shipments) and the recent demand spike, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate demand for the 3-period window (L+1) at 120 units (40/week), reflecting the recent high of 47. I've set L to 2 (promised) but will rely on a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat to force the OR backend to order despite the 'ghost' pipeline inventory caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 12 demand spike to 47 units observed; trend shows departure from the low-20s average seen in P3-P11. Effective pipeline recalculated weekly by subtracting 128 units (P1, P3 lost volumes) from reported In-transit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the SKU 'Charlotte Body Push' (Women's Lingerie) is out of stock. Demand has fluctuated: a low-regime average of ~25 units (P3-P11) was interrupted by a spike to 47 in P12 and 28 in P13. The current In-transit status (213 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments from P1 (56) and P3 (72), totaling 128 units which will never arrive. The 'Effective Pipeline' is 85 units (213 - 128). To counteract the OR backend's use of the inflated 213 unit pipeline, I must artificially increase mu_hat. Following the logic: Target Base Stock = Expected Demand (L+1) + Safety Stock + Lost Volume. With L=2, (L+1)=3. Recent demand avg (P11-P13) is ~33. 33*3 = 99. Adding the 128 units of lost volume to the base stock calculation gives a required mu_hat of ~227. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - 213) results in a meaningful net order to cover current demand and replenish the stockout.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15 (May 20, 2019). The product is a lace push-up body (lingerie). Demand has fluctuated: P1-P2 saw a burst (60s), P3-P11 stabilized around ~25, and P12-P14 show a slight upward trend (avg ~33 over last 3 weeks). However, the primary issue is the pipeline inventory. Reported In-transit is 241 units. Based on history, orders from P1 (56) and P3 (72) are lost. The remaining valid in-transit units are from P14 (49) and previous unsettled periods. Total lost units = 128. The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). With on-hand=0, it sees 241 in-transit. If we use a realistic mu_hat (e.g., (1+2)*30 = 90), the OR engine will order 0 because 241 is far above the target. To force an order to cover current demand, we must inflate mu_hat to offset the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (Forecasted Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock. With demand ~30 and L=2, we need ~90 units + safety. Since 128 units are 'dead' in reality, we set mu_hat = 90 (actual target) + 128 (offset) = 218. This ensures the backend places an order to replenish the zero on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend increasing: Average demand P12-P14 is 33.3, up from 25.0 in P3-P11. Pipeline correction factor remains 128 units due to lost shipments in P1 and P3.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/27 (Period 16). The SKU is a lace push-up body (lingerie), likely seeing increased seasonal demand during late spring. Observed demand in P15 was 42 units, confirming a shift from the P3-P11 average (~25) to a higher regime (avg P12-P15 is 35.5). Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 251 units. However, based on 'Carry-over insights', shipments from P1 (56 units) and P3 (72 units) are confirmed lost (total 128 units). Subtracting these from the reported in-transit (251 - 128) leaves an effective pipeline of 123 units (P14 order of 49 and P15 order of 10 are still in transit, but there's a discrepancy/ghost inventory in the system beyond the known losses). To force the OR backend to order despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted weekly demand is ~36. Projected demand for L+1 (3 periods) is 108 units. To account for the 128 lost units that the backend incorrectly includes in its 'on-hand + in-transit' calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by that amount: 108 (demand) + 128 (loss compensation) = 236 units. L is set to calculated to reflect the 1-2 period lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 12-15 average demand is 35.5, a 42% increase from the prior 25.0 average.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU '487722001' is experiencing a sustained demand increase. Since Period 12, weekly demand has averaged 36.0 units (47, 28, 25, 42, 38), a significant upward shift from the previous regime's average of ~25 units. The system reports 267 units in transit, but historical evidence confirms that 128 units (P1: 56, P3: 72) are permanently lost. Additionally, orders from P14 (49 units), P15 (10 units), and P16 (16 units) are still within or just past the promised lead time of 2 periods and have not yet arrived. Our current stock is 0. To prevent persistent stockouts during this higher-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~36 units/week. Since the backend calculates final order as 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', and the 'pipeline_inventory' is inflated by 128 lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to manually compensate. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stk. With L=2, mean=36, base stock should be ~108 + safety. However, to force an order despite the 128 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 260. This value, when processed by the OR backend, will offset the 'In-transit' phantom inventory to trigger an order that maintains availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated: Period 12-16 average demand is 36.0 units/week (+44% vs P3-P11). Pipeline is permanently inflated by 128 'ghost' units (P1, P3 losses).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), the SKU is in a sustained elevated demand regime starting from Period 12. The average demand from P12-P17 is ~34 units/week. Inventory is critically low (On-hand: 1). There is a significant 'ghost' inventory in the In-transit reported value (261 units). This includes 128 units definitively lost from P1 (56) and P3 (72), as they are now 17 and 15 periods overdue respectively. Subtracting these 128 units gives an effective pipeline of 133 units. However, the OR backend uses the full 261 units in its 'final_order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)' logic. Since 261 is likely higher than the computed base_stock, the engine won't order anything unless I artificially inflate mu_hat to overcome the 128-unit discrepancy. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*35 + 128 to ensure the system places an order that accounts for the current demand regime while bypassing the 'blocked' state created by the lost units. L is set to 2 as that is the promised and most frequent actual lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/6/17), we are managing SKU 487722001 (Women's Lingerie Body). The immediate concern is the inventory stockout (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 261 units is misleading because it includes 128 'ghost' units from confirmed lost shipments in Periods 1 and 3 (56 + 72). Substracting these, the true pipeline is 133 units, consisting of orders from P14 (49), P17 (20), and P18 (0). The order from P14 (placed 5 periods ago) is now significantly overdue compared to the promised lead time of 2, suggesting further supply chain instability. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 12, with the P12-P18 average at ~32.4 units/week. To compensate for the 128 units of false inventory the OR backend sees in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Specifically, mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Pipeline_Correction. Using L=2, Forecast=33, and Correction=128, the target is set to 227 [(3*33)+128]. This forces the OR engine to order enough to ignore the lost 128 units and satisfy the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the volatility of this more active demand period (P12-P18).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Period 14 order (49 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered 5 periods ago, L=2 promised), increasing the total likely lost/stalled units in pipeline to 177 (128 previous + 49 new).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 20 (2019/6/24), we are managing a 'Womens Lingerie Lace push-up body'. Demand has shown two distinct regimes: an initial high burst (P1-P2, avg 65), followed by a lower stable period (P3-P11, avg 25), and a more recent elevated trend (P12-P19, avg 32). In the last 4 periods, demand was 42, 38, 25, 22, 26 (avg 30.6). The supply chain is highly unstable. Current In-transit is 261 units, but 177 units are likely lost (P1: 56, P3: 72, P14: 49). This leaves an 'Effective Pipeline' of only 84 units (261 - 177). Because the OR backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) uses the full reported In-transit (261), it will under-order unless we artificially increase mu_hat. To compensate, we must add the 'ghost' units (177) to the target base stock. Target mu_hat = (1+L) * expected_demand + lost_units. With L=2 and expected_demand ~31, mu_hat = (3 * 31) + 177 = 270. We set L to explicit 2 (promised) to stabilize the lead time component and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture recent volatility while excluding the extreme initial P1-P2 data.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability significantly worsened: Period 14 order (49 units) is confirmed lost/stalled (5 periods since order). Total 'ghost' units in pipeline inventory is 177 (P1, P3, P14).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are managing SKU 487722001. Current state: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 297. My carry-over insights confirm that 177 units in the pipeline are 'ghost' units from lost/stalled shipments (P1=56, P3=72, P14=49). Subtracting these from the reported 297 units gives an effective pipeline of 120 units (which includes P17=20 units and P20=36 units, but there is still an unexplained discrepancy suggesting further supply chain delays or more ghost units not yet classified). Since P12, demand has localized in a higher regime than the P3-P11 lull; the average demand from Period 12-20 is 31.3 units/week. To ensure the backend places an order that accounts for the 177 lost 'ghost' units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Formula: Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean. With L=2 and Mean=31.3, standard base stock would be 93.9. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 297 In-transit units from the base stock. To force an order, I must set mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock + Ghost Units) = 93.9 + 177 = 270.9. I will round this up to 275 to ensure a safety margin given the frequent stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to reflect the volatility seen in recent periods (ranging from 22 to 47).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Reported pipeline (297) is significantly higher than observable pending orders (20+36=56), suggesting either extreme delivery delays for recent orders or that further shipments beyond P1, P3, and P14 are effectively lost. Ghost units now treated as 177.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. Period 14 (49 units) is now 8 periods in the past, confirming it as lost. Total 'ghost' units in the pipeline (units that will never arrive but contribute to the OR engine's pipeline count) is currently 177 (P1: 56, P3: 72, P14: 49). The current In-transit is reported at 317, while the actual viable pipeline consists of orders from P17 (20 units), P20 (36 units), and P21 (20 units), totaling only 76 units. The difference (317 - 76 = 241) indicates that either additional recent shipments have been lost or the reporting is lagging severely. Demand is currently in a steady regime, averaging 29.8 units over the last 10 periods (P12-P21). To counteract the 'ghost' inventory of 241 units preventing the OR engine from ordering, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1=3) period window: (3 * 29.8) + (safety stock). Given the extreme supply risk, I will set mu_hat significantly higher to force an order that clears the corrupted pipeline logic and ensures on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Pipeline gap increased to 241 'ghost' units (Reported 317 vs. 76 actually pending from P17 upwards). These units (P1, P3, P14, and potentially others) are permanently stalled or lost and must be manually offset by inflating mu_hat.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 487722001 is currently experiencing extreme stockouts and supply chain instability. Current on-hand is 0. The reported In-transit inventory (330) is largely comprised of 'ghost units'\u2014shipments that were recorded but never arrived. Specifically, orders from P1 (56), P3 (72), P14 (49), and now presumably P17 (20) and P21 (20) are significantly overdue or lost. The REAL pending pipeline consists of the P22 order (49 units), which is expected to arrive in P24 (L=2). Currently, there is an massive gap of approximately 281 'ghost units' (330 reported - 49 real). At the same time, demand has spiked significantly to 75 units in P22, possibly due to seasonality (mid-July). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of forecasted demand PLUS the ghost inventory offset. Forecasted demand for the next 3 periods is ~150 units (assuming ~50/week following the spike). Offset is +281. Target base stock should be ~431 to trigger any order. I will use 'explicit' to bypass the internal pipeline logic and ensure replenishment occurs despite the false inventory data.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Ghost units in pipeline reached 281 (Reported 330 vs 49 actually pending from P22). Orders P1, P3, P14, P17, and P21 are now considered lost. Demand spiked to 75 in P22; monitor for sustained increase or peak summer seasonality.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (P22: 75, P23: 87), coinciding with peak summer seasonality for this product (Womens Lingerie/Body). Average demand for the last three periods (P21-P23) is 63.7, compared to the previous elevated regime of ~36. Pipeline reliability remains poor: total 'ghost' units (lost/stalled orders) have reached 332 units (Reported In-transit 441 - Expected order from P23 180 = 261; however, total unexplained units calculated by subtracting all viable pending orders from the reported total). Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', I must inflate 'mu_hat' by these 332 ghost units plus the expected demand for the (L+1) period. With L=2 (promised), L+1=3 periods of demand (approx 191 units) + 332 ghost units = 523. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the massive fictional pipeline. Recent_N (N=3) captures the current July demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: P22-P23 avg (81 units) is >200% of P12-P17 average, likely seasonal. Total ghost units in pipeline updated to 332 units (Reported 441 - valid P23 order 180 = 261, but reconciling older lost orders P1, P3, P14, P17, P21 brings total stalled volume to 332 based on reported vs expected gaps).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. We are in a high-demand seasonal regime (P22-P24 average demand = 76.3). The reported In-transit inventory of 611 units is highly misleading due to accumulated 'ghost' units from lost/stalled shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (56), P3 (72), P14 (49), and P17 (20) have never arrived. Total ghost units = 56+72+49+20 = 197. Valid pipeline consists of P23 (180) and P24 (170), totaling 350 units. Reported (611) - Valid (350) = 261 ghost units. To force the OR backend (which uses total reported pipeline) to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat to account for these 261 non-existent units over the lead time (L+1=3). Setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat calculation: Base forecast (76.3 * 3) + 261 = 490. This ensures we maintain availability during this summer peak despite significant supply chain attrition.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Accumulated ghost units in pipeline identified as 261 (Reported 611 - valid P23+P24 orders of 350). Orders P1, P3, P14, P17, and P21 are definitively lost or permanently stalled. Current demand regime (P22-P24) average is 76.3 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), we are experiencing a significant demand surge (P25 demand reached 103). The last three weeks (P23-P25) have an average demand of 85.7 units/week, which is more than double the previous regime. The actual on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 611 units, but this is heavily distorted by 'ghost units' (lost orders). Comparing the reported pipeline to actual pending orders: Valid orders are P23 (180), P24 (170), and P25 (0), totaling 350 units. The remaining 261 units (611 - 350) identified in P25 insights remain invisible or lost (P1: 56, P3: 72, P14: 49, P17: 20, P20: 36, P21: 20, P22: 49 totaled similarly; however, note P20-P22 were actually partially received, so the 261 figure is the calculated residual gap). To ensure the OR engine actually orders enough to meet the new 85.7 demand level while it incorrectly perceives the 261 ghost units as available supply, I must adjust mu_hat. mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecasted_Demand. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should be 3 * 85.7 = 257. To neutralize the 261 ghost units, I add them to the target: 257 + 261 = 518. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (P23-P25 std dev is ~18), so sqrt(3) * 18 \u2248 31.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike continues: P23-P25 average demand is 85.7 units/week. Ghost units in pipeline remains 261 units (Reported 611 - valid P23+P24 orders of 350).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/12. We are in a high-demand seasonal regime (P22-P26), with the most recent sample (P26) reaching 129 units. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P24-P26) is 99.7 units. The 'ghost' units in the pipeline (stalled/lost orders P1, P3, P14, P17, P21) are estimated at 261 units. Reported In-transit is 431, and we know 170 units from P24 are valid (431 - 170 = 261), confirming the ghost count. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this high demand despite the inflated pipeline, I must adjust mu_hat. With a promised lead time of 2 (target coverage of 3 periods), and expected demand around 100-110 units/week, the base stock targets ~330 units. Since on-hand is 51 and the 'effective' pipeline is 170, the OR calculation (base_stock - reported_pipeline) would result in a negative or zero order if I don't compensate for the 261 ghost units. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to account for both the 3-period demand (~315) and the 261 unit pipeline offset, totaling 576. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 45 * sqrt(3)) to maintain a high service level during this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P24-P26 avg is 99.7 units/week, confirming a strong seasonal peak. Pipeline ghost units confirmed at 261 (Reported 431 - valid P24 order 170).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. We are in a significant seasonal demand peak for SKU 487722001 (Women's Lingerie Body), with demand in P24-P27 averaging 102 units/period (67, 103, 129, 109). On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 657 units. However, we must account for 'ghost units'\u2014shipments that are definitively lost or permanently stalled\u2014to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering. Based on historical reconciliation: P1 (56), P3 (72), P14 (49), P17 (20), and P21 (20) are lost, totaling 217 units. Additionally, P24 (170) is now at L=4 (2 periods overdue) and P27 (226) is pending. Reported (657) - Valid Pending (226 for P27) = 431 units of uncertainty. If P24 (170) is also stalled, ghost units could be as high as 431. I will assume P24 is still coming but delayed, keeping the ghost count at 261 (as per Period 27 insight). To compensate for 261 ghost units in a (L+1=3) period window, I must inflate mu_hat. Mean demand (last 4) is ~102. Base mu_hat (L=2) = 102 * 3 = 306. Adding the 261 unit pipeline offset = 567. Sigma is set to reflect the high volatility (std dev of recent peak is ~25, so sqrt(3)*25 approx 43).

Carry-over insight: Demand peak sustained: P24-P27 average demand is 102.0 units/week. Ghost units in pipeline reached 261 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21) and must be offset manually in mu_hat calculations to ensure the capped policy triggers orders.

Current date is 2019/8/26 (Late Summer). Demand for this SKU has fundamentally shifted from a mid-regime (avg ~36) to a high seasonal peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 104.2 units/week. Supply chain instability is chronic: reported In-transit is 657 units, but only the P27 order (226 units) and P24 order (170 units) are potentially valid/arriving, totalling 396 units. The remaining 261 units (ghost units: P1, P3, P14, P17, P21) are definitively lost or permanently stalled. To ensure the backend OR engine (which uses standard base-stock logic: order = base_stock - in_transit) continues to place orders despite the inflated 'ghost' pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 261 units. Calculation: Targeted Demand for coverage (L+1) is ~104 * 3 = 312. To overcome the 261 ghost units in the pipeline deduction, I set mu_hat to approximately 573 (312 + 261) to trigger necessary replenishment. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent high-volatility peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Seasonal demand peak stabilized at ~104 units/week (P24-P28). Ghost units in pipeline remains 261 (Reported 657 - Valid P24 order 170 - Valid P27 order 226 = 261). Manual mu_hat inflation is required to bypass these lost units in the logic.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), demand for the push-up body has transitioned into a highly elevated seasonal regime. The average demand from P24 to P29 is approximately 99.2 units/week, a significant increase from earlier periods. Supply chain reliability remains a major obstacle: the system reports 657 units 'In-transit', but reconciliation shows that orders from P1 (56), P3 (72), P14 (49), P17 (20), and P21 (20) are effectively lost, and the large P24 order (170) is now four periods overdue, suggesting a total of 431 'ghost' units (657 total - 226 valid P27 order = 431). To trigger the OR backend to order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 with L=2) at the current rate (~100/week) plus an inflation factor to neutralize the 431 lost units. Target base stock = (3 * 100) + 431 = 731. Since the OR backend uses the formula [base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat], I am setting mu_hat to 731 and sigma_hat to 0 to bypass the statistical calculation and force a high enough target to overcome the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain failure worsened; P24 order (170 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised L=2), bringing total 'ghost' units in pipeline to 431 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24). Seasonal demand peaked and is maintaining ~100 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand is in a high-seasonal regime (avg ~100/week since P24), though the last two periods (74, 92) suggest a slight cooling or stabilization. Supply chain instability is severe: orders from P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, and now P24 (totaling 431 units) are effectively lost or permanently stalled. Reported In-transit is 505, but only the P30 order (74 units) is likely 'live' (505 - 431 = 74). To allow the OR backend's capped base-stock policy to trigger a new order, I must treat these 431 'ghost' units as part of the required base stock by inflating mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) periods (L=2) is ~300. Adding the 431 lost units to the target inventory ensures the OR engine (which subtracts the full 505 pipeline) still places an order to cover the next phase. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 731 (300 + 431) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect high volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Ghost units in pipeline reached 431 (Reported 505 - Valid P30 order 74). Lost orders include P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, and now P24 (170 units). Demand appears to be slightly softening from the >100 peak but remains in the high regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16. Demand has entered a high-regime seasonal peak since Period 22, with the average over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) being 90.2 units/week. While recent demand (P31: 53) suggests a softening from the peak (>100), it remains significantly elevated compared to the early-year baseline. Supply chain performance is highly unreliable. Based on the history and current 'In-transit' of 737, we identify the following 'ghost' units (confirmed or highly likely stalled/lost): P1(56), P3(72), P14(49), P17(20), P21(20), and P24(170) = 387 units. Reconciling reported pipeline (737) vs. likely valid pending orders (P30: 74, P31: 232 = 306), the 'ghost' or delayed volume is roughly 431 units. To ensure the backend OR engine (which uses 'pipeline' in its subtraction logic) actually places orders, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 431 ghost units. We set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean_demand + ghost_pipeline_offset. With L=2 (promised) and mean_demand for high regime ~85, base mu_hat is 255. Adding the 431 ghost units gives 686. Sigma_hat is set using recent history to capture the volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total ghost units in pipeline confirmed at 431 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24). Pipeline reconciliation: Reported 737 - Valid (P30: 74 + P31: 232) = 431 units permanently stalled. Demand softening from peak but remains in high-regime (~85-90/week).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/23. Demand in the most recent periods (P31-P32) has softened from the seasonal peak (>100 units/week) to an average of 59.5 units/week. However, identifying the post-peak regime (P29-P32) shows an average of 71.25 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently high at 321 units following the arrival of the P30 and P31 orders. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 431) consists entirely of 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24), meaning the effective pipeline for the OR engine is zero. To ensure the backend's capped base-stock policy triggers orders when needed despite these ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the ghost 431 units. Setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 580 (calculated as approximately (1+L)*70 + 360) provides a buffer, but given the high on-hand (321) and current demand (66), immediate over-ordering is a risk. I will setting mu_hat slightly lower than the ghost volume to prevent unnecessary orders while on-hand is high, but high enough to trigger orders once on-hand drops below ~70 units. I use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: On-hand inventory recovered to 321 units. Pipeline of 431 units remains confirmed as 'ghost' units (lost shipments P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24). Post-peak demand regime (P29-P32) average is 71.3 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2759.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (2019/09/30), we are managing a situation of significant supply chain noise and evolving demand seasonality. Demand in Period 33 spiked to 154 units, the highest in the history, contrasting with the 'softening' observed in the previous three periods (avg ~71). This suggests that while we are post-summer peak, high-volatility events or late-season surges are possible. The pipeline is currently reported as 431 units, but based on historical analysis, all 431 units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24). Consequently, the actual effective pipeline is zero. Because the OR backend uses 'reported in-transit' (431) to calculate new orders (Policy: base_stock - pipeline), it will not place any new orders unless base_stock exceeds 431. To force the system to order against the current demand of ~70-80 units/week (plus the recent spike), I must inflate mu_hat significantly to offset the 431 ghost units. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 700 units (intended to cover [3 periods * 90 avg demand] + 431 offset) to ensure replenishment occurs. Sigma_hat is set to a high 'recent_N' (3) to account for the recent 154-unit spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Extreme demand spike of 154 units observed in P33 (+116% vs P29-P32 average); demand regime is highly volatile post-peak. Pipeline is confirmed 100% 'ghost' units (431 units lost), necessitating extreme 'explicit' mu_hat inflation to bypass the backend's pipeline subtraction logic.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the SKU is in a post-peak seasonal phase with high volatility (P33: 154, P34: 58). The average demand of the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approximately 100 units/week. However, the system's pipeline inventory is heavily compromised. As verified in previous periods, multiple orders (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, and P24) totaling 431 units have permanently stalled or been lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 690 includes these 431 'ghost units', meaning the true valid pipeline is 259 (the P34 order). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting these 431 ghost units from the target stock and thus failing to place necessary orders, I must use the 'explicit' method. For mu_hat, I set a value that covers expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 300 units) plus the 431 ghost unit offset, totaling 731. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) stays above the reported pipeline (690) to trigger replenishments as demand persists. Sigma_hat is set to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed ghost units in pipeline remain 431 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24). Current reported In-transit (690) - Ghost Units (431) = 259 (Valid P34 order). Demand remains volatile but high-regime (avg ~90-100).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand inventory is 23. Reported in-transit is 820. Historical analysis shows 431 units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1: 56, P3: 72, P14: 49, P17: 20, P21: 20, P24: 170, P27 missing 44). Valid pipeline: P34 (259) + P35 (130) = 389 units. Current demand regime (P29-P35) averages 83.3 units/week. To ensure the backend order logic (base_stock - pipeline) triggers an order despite the 431 ghost units inflating the pipeline, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base_stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and mean demand ~84, target base_stock \u2248 252. To offset the 431 ghost units, mu_hat must be at least 252 + 431 = 683. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx sqrt(3)*45) to maintain a healthy safety stock buffer during this volatile post-peak period.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Ghost units in pipeline remain 431 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24). Valid pipeline consists of P34 (259) and P35 (130). Demand regime P29-P35 avg is 83.3 units/week. Supply chain remains unreliable; manual mu_hat inflation is required to bypass ghost pipeline inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37, the supply chain continues to show significant unreliability. Period 24 (170 units) is confirmed lost, adding to the previous losses (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21), keeping the total 'ghost' units in the pipeline at 431 units. The reported in-transit of 690 includes these 431 ghost units plus the 259 units ordered in Period 34 (expected soon as L=2 promised). Demand remains in a high-volatility, high-regime state after the summer peak; the average demand from Period 29-36 is approximately 88 units/week. To ensure the backend OR policy (which subtracts the full 690 in-transit) actually places an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate base_stock for 3 periods of demand (approx 264 units) and add the 431 ghost units to bypass the backend subtraction: 264 + 431 = 695. This setting aims to maintain current on-hand inventory levels against the volatile 80-110 units/week demand pattern observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost units in pipeline remains 431 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24). P34 order (259 units) is the only valid shipment expected. Demand regime P29-P36 average is 87.9 units/week.

The reported In-transit is 747 units. To make an order, I must reconcile this pipeline. Valid orders expected: P34 (259), P37 (57), and whatever is placed in P38. However, P34 is now 4 periods old (Promised L=2) and should have arrived; it is currently 2 periods overdue. Our 'Ghost units' logic: P1(56), P3(72), P14(49), P17(20), P21(20), P24(170) = 387 confirmed lost units. If P34 (259) is also lost, the ghost count is 646. Subtracting 646 from 747 reported leaving 101 units, which includes the P37 order of 57. This suggests P34 is almost certainly lost or significantly stalled. To ensure the capped policy triggers an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. High-regime demand (L=2) requires a base stock of approx (1+2)*110 = 330. Adding the ghost units (approx 646-690) to this target allows the OR engine to 'see' through the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total ghost units in pipeline updated to 646 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, and now P34 - 259 units). P34 is 2 periods past promised lead time with no arrival. Demand regime P33-P37 average is 111.4 units/week, indicating sustained high volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand is in an extreme high-volatility peak (Period 37-38 avg: 166 units/week). The supply chain is highly unreliable with significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (units reported as In-transit that will likely never arrive). Period 34 (259 units) is now overdue (3 periods since order, promised L=2), and previous orders P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, and P24 (total 431 units) are confirmed lost. Total ghost units = 431 (old) + 259 (P34) = 690 units. Reported In-transit is 1183. Valid In-transit = 1183 - 690 = 493 (this is only the P38 order). To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value that exceeds the reported In-transit (1183) plus anticipated current demand. I will set mu_hat to 1900 to ensure a robust 'base stock' that offsets the 690 ghost units and covers 3 periods of ~170 demand (approx 510) plus safety stock. This forces the system to recognize the need for more inventory despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost units in pipeline significantly increased to 690 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, and now P34 - 259 units confirmed lost). Demand has entered an extreme peak phase (P37-P38 avg: 166) exceeding all previous seasonal peaks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has accelerated into an extreme seasonal peak, likely due to pre-holiday or Singles' Day (Nov 11) shopping, with an average demand of 154.3 units per week over the last 3 periods (P37-P39). Supply chain instability remains a severe issue. Ghost units in the pipeline (units reported as in-transit but effectively lost or permanently stalled) now total 690 units: P1 (56), P3 (72), P14 (49), P17 (20), P21 (20), P24 (170), and now P34 (259). The P34 order is confirmed lost after 5 periods with no arrival. The current reported In-transit is 2054. Subtracting 690 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 1364 units (from P38-P39). The OR backend's capped base-stock policy subtracts the full 2054 units from the target inventory; therefore, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract this 690-unit 'ghost' inventory. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use 'explicit' to calculate (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Units. Forecast = 155; (1+2)*155 + 690 = 465 + 690 = 1155. This ensures the engine targeting ~465 total stock considers 690 units as already 'gone' from the pipeline. Sigma_hat is inflated to handle the high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total ghost units in pipeline confirmed at 690 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34). Demand is in an extreme height phase averaging ~155/week. Supply chain remains highly unreliable with approx 30% of pipeline volume permanently stalled.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an extreme high-demand regime, with the last 4 periods (P37-P40) averaging 147.25 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 2054 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' shipments (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34), which are confirmed as lost or permanently stalled. The calculated total ghost volume is 690 units. Additionally, recent large orders from P38 (493 units) and P39 (871 units) have not yet arrived. Our objective is to ensure the OR backend places an order to meet the current ~147 unit/week demand, despite the backend thinking we have 2054 units coming. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (2054) from the base stock, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3) PLUS the ghost units to force an order. Calculation: (Target Base Stock for L=2) + (Ghost Units) = (3 * 150) + 690 = 1140. I will set mu_hat to 1140 and L to 2. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect extremely high recent volatility (126 to 183 range).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Extremely high demand regime (avg ~147) and high volatility sustained. Pipeline remains 33.6% 'ghost' units (690 total). Explicit mu_hat inflation is required until ghost units are resolved or flushed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1689.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we observe that the large order from Period 39 (871 units) has arrived after a lead time of 2 periods, bringing on-hand inventory to 743. However, the order from Period 38 (493 units) is now 4 periods overdue and is highly likely lost or permanently stalled, adding to the 'ghost' inventory. Total ghost units in pipeline are now estimated at 1,183 (total in-transit) minus 0 (no valid recent orders are pending; P39 arrived, P38 is lost, and no orders were placed in P40-P41). This means the reported In-transit of 1,183 is entirely comprised of ghost units (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, P38). Demand has stabilized in an extreme high regime, averaging 143.4 units/week over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,183 units as available supply and stopping all orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock: (Average Demand 143.4) * (L+1=3) = 430.2. To force an order despite the 1,183 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately Target + Ghost Pipeline = 430 + 1183 = 1613. However, since on-hand is already high (743), which is well above the actual needs for the next few periods, I will set mu_hat more conservatively to prevent excessive overstocking while ensuring the system isn't paralyzed by the false pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total ghost units in pipeline confirmed at 1,183 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, and now P38 - 493 units). P38 is 4 periods overdue. Current demand regime P37-P41 average is 143.4 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019). We occupy a high-demand seasonal regime (P37-P42 avg: 149.8 units/week). On-hand inventory is 560 units. The Reported In-transit is 1,183. However, based on tracking, 1,183 units are confirmed as 'ghosts' (lost/stalled: P1=56, P3=72, P14=49, P17=20 (missing from reconciliation previously), P21=20, P24=170, P34=259, P38=493 + potential other leakage). Reconciling the history: Every order placed since P39 has arrived (P39 arrived in P41), and there were no orders in P40-P42. Thus, the actual pipeline is 0. The 1,183 units are permanently stalled and prevent the OR engine from ordering due to the (base_stock - pipeline) logic. I must set mu_hat explicitly high to force the logic to overcome this 1,183 unit phantom inventory and protect against the high demand (avg ~150). To cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~150/week and offset the 1,183 ghost units, I need a mu_hat > 1633. I will set mu_hat to 1650 to ensure a small order is triggered if demand persists at this peak, and sigma_hat using recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed extreme supply chain variance. Total ghost units in pipeline reached 1,183 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, P38). Actual pipeline is 0 units, but backend sees 1,183. Demand regime is currently at peak-seasonal height (~150 units/week).

Daily Reward (R_t): $760.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (2019-12-09), the system reports 494 units on-hand and 1,183 units in-transit. Based on historical reconciliation, all 1,183 units in-transit are categorized as 'ghost' units (lost or permanently stalled: P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, P38). There are currently 0 valid pending orders. Demand has shifted from an extreme peak of ~150 units/week (P37-P42) to a much lower 66 units in P43, suggesting the end of the seasonal peak. To ensure the backend OR policy (which subtracts the 1,183 ghost units from its base stock calculation) triggers any necessary replenishment, I must use 'explicit' inflation. While on-hand (494) currently covers ~5-7 weeks of forecasted demand (~70-90/week), the ghost inventory forces a massive negative offset. I will set mu_hat to 1,900 and sigma_hat to 350; this creates a target base stock that safely exceeds the 1,183 ghost units + 494 on-hand units, allowing the system to order when inventory physically depletes despite the false 'in-transit' data.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Post-peak demand shift observed; P43 demand dropped to 66 units. All 1,183 in-transit units are confirmed 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, P38). Actual pipeline is zero.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Dec 16, 2019. Demand has dropped significantly from the seasonal peak (P41: 128, P42: 183 down to P43: 66 and P44: 83), suggesting the post-holiday/pre-Christmas period is seeing a volume reset. Inventory on-hand is 411 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1,982 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' units. Reconciling the pipeline: Lost orders include P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, and P38 (total 1,183 units). The Period 44 order of 799 units is the only active shipment. Thus, 'Ghost' units = 1,982 - 799 = 1,183. To ensure the backend OR policy (which subtracts the full 1,982 pipeline) actually places orders if needed, I must inflate mu_hat. However, with 411 on-hand and 799 incoming (total 1,210 real units) against a current demand of ~75/week, we are safely overstocked for the remaining 3 periods of the game. I will set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the ghost pipeline (1,183) + expected demand (3 weeks * 75 = 225) = 1,408 to prevent the system from being paralyzed by the false pipeline data, although the cap and current high stock mean no new order is actually required.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed demand drop (avg ~75 units/week) following the late-November peak. Total 'ghost' units in pipeline remains 1,183 (Reported 1,982 minus active P44 order of 799).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the post-peak holiday season. Demand has settled significantly from the November highs (avg ~150) to a more moderate regime (P43-P45 avg: 78.7 units/week). The supply chain remains severely compromised. We have 1,183 units confirmed as 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, P38) that the backend considers 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Current reported In-transit is 1,982. Subtracting the ghost units (1,982 - 1,183) leaves 799 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 44. Since on-hand is 324 and the valid pipeline is 799, we have 1,123 effective units against a demand of ~79/week. With only two periods remaining in the game (P46, P47) and a promised L=2, any order placed now would likely arrive after the game ends. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,183 ghost units as available inventory and potentially blocking necessary orders (if demand were higher), I normally inflate mu_hat. However, with 1,123 units available for ~160 units of expected remaining demand, we are overstocked. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the current 78.7 mean and ~11.1 std, and L to default. This ensures no new orders are placed while maintaining a realistic forecast for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed demand regime shift post-peak; Period 43-45 average is 78.7 units/week. Ghost units in pipeline remain at 1,183 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, P38).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (2019-12-30), the product has moved past its late-November peak demand (avg ~143) into a more stable post-peak regime. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P43-P46) is 70.0 units/week. On-hand inventory is 280 units. The critical challenge remains the heavily distorted 'In-transit' figure: the backend sees 1,982 units, but based on the history of lost orders (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, P38), 1,183 units are effectively 'ghost' units that will never arrive. The only valid shipment is from P44 (799 units), meaning total valid inventory (on-hand + actual pipeline) is approx 1,079 units. Since the current demand is ~70 units/week and L=2, the total requirement for the coverage period (L+1=3) is ~210 units. Our actual stock (1,079) is far above this. However, to prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1,183 'ghost' units and stopping all future replenishment when needed, I must maintain an 'explicit' mu_hat that offsets these lost units. For this period, with high on-hand stock and decreasing demand, I will set mu_hat based on the current regime (N=4, avg=70, total=210) but adding a buffer to account for the supply chain's extreme unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P43-P46) is ~70 units/week. Ghost units in pipeline remain constant at 1,183 (P1, P3, P14, P17, P21, P24, P34, P38).
