The initial peak of 97 in early January may have been post-holiday sales; the most recent 4-week average is 59.5. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover 3 periods (L+1 = 2+1) of demand until the next achievable arrival, I need to account for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 demand. d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Projected demand for P1-P3 is roughly 180 units (60 units * 3). e) Logic: I will order 210 units to cover the pipeline demand and establish a small safety stock buffer, as I am starting from zero inventory and need to fulfill demand starting this period.",

However, I have 0 on-hand for P2 demand (already lost P1 demand of 45). To ensure I am stocked for P5 (the first period an order placed now can influence) and to maintain a safety buffer against the current stockout, I will calculate: Target = 4 periods of demand (P2-P5) = 65 * 4 = 260.

The fact that 'In-transit' still shows 480 suggests the system might be counting the lost P1 order (210) and potentially other orders.

Analyzing the timeline: January demand was ~65; March increased to ~135; April peaked around ~222; and May has seen a step-down to ~167 (average of 145 and 189). As of May 20th, we are past the spring peak but still in a relatively high-demand season compared to winter. The actual lead time is consistently 1-2 periods (Period 12 order arrived in 2 periods).

Anticipating a weekly demand of ~170-190 units, this safely covers current demand. Looking ahead: The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 680, but this includes a very large order from Period 10 (220 units) which might be delayed/lost given it was ordered 5 periods ago, or it might just be the cumulative total of remaining orders. Let's recalculate pipeline: In-transit (680) - P13(120) = 560 units. These 560 units likely consist of the P10(220) and P12(330) which actually arrived (330 arrived in P14, leaving 680 - 120 - 330 = 230 in-transit). The remaining ~230 in-transit likely refers to the overdue P10 order (220 units). Since P10 hasn't arrived in 5 periods, I must treat it as lost. Therefore, actual useful pipeline is near 0 once P13 arrives. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at ~170 units/period (~510 units), I need to place a fresh order.",

The most recent demand (P25) was 74, while the July average was approximately 105 units/week. We are currently in early August (P26). On-hand inventory is 189 units, which covers about two periods of current demand. However, the in-transit pipeline is extremely bloated at 1380 units. Even though history shows a risk of shipment loss (approx. 25-30%), there is still an massive amount of potential arrivals (orders from P12 (120), P13 (120), P15 (350), P16 (350), P17 (350), P18 (350), etc., though many are verified lost in carry-over insights). Specifically, the in-transit figure of 1380 units suggests several large orders are still considered 'active' by the system. Given that demand has cooled significantly and holding costs are $1.00/unit (equal to profit), the risk of overstocking far outweighs the risk of stockout. I will maintain a zero-order strategy to allow on-hand inventory and any surviving in-transit shipments to be absorbed by the current lower demand regime.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 'Luna skinny RW' is a basic womenswear item (5-pocket jeans). Historical data and world knowledge suggest demand for denim usually finds stability in late autumn, following a significant spring-summer peak. Current demand (Late Oct/Early Nov) is stable in a low-seasonal regime of 30-50 units per period. Lead times recently showed P37 arriving in 1 period and P36 arriving in 3 periods, indicating continued shipping instability. I must maintain enough inventory to cover the expected lead time plus a buffer for potential losses (which occur ~30% of the time) and the 2-period promised lead time. Current On-hand is 33. In-transit consists of 1500 units from older periods (P22 and prior) which are confirmed lost, plus P38 (50 units) and P39 (50 units). The viable pipeline is 100 units. Adding Period 40's order, the total viable stock (On-hand 33 + viable In-transit 100 + new order) should cover 3 periods of demand (~150 units). To reach this coverage, I will order 50 units.",

Historically, early demand in February 2019 was also around this level (45-77), confirming low seasonal demand for winter. Regarding inventory, 1,500 units of the 1,630 in-transit are confirmed lost from shipments prior to Period 22. Valid in-transit consists of Period 38 (50 units), Period 39 (50 units), and Period 40 (50 units). Lead times have been volatile (1-3 periods). At the start of Period 41, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 41 is estimated at ~60. Expected arrivals in Period 41 (from Period 38/39/40) are likely enough to cover immediate demand, but due to a 30% shipment loss rate and 0 on-hand, I must maintain a buffer.

P40 is now at L=2 and expected to arrive in P42. If P40 arrives, inventory will be 24 + 50 = 74, covering one period of demand. Given the 30% shipment loss rate, I must order to maintain a safety buffer since on-hand+viable in-transit (excluding the lost 1500) equals 24 + 50 (P40) + 80 (P41) = 154 units. This covers roughly 3 periods of demand at the current 45-50/unit average.

Historical demand in late Nov (Period 42) spiked from the previous ~45 average to 130, which aligns with 'Black Friday' retail trends. Demand for 'Everyday Collection' denim likely remains elevated but may dip slightly from the peak promotion week. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods), and about 30% of orders are lost.

Historically, the December regime is expected to settle between 80-100 units/period as holiday shopping continues. Regarding the pipeline, the 'In-transit' figure of 1700 is misleading because 1500 units from early periods (P22 and prior) are confirmed lost.

Demand analysis shows a significant drop-off in late December/early January, with Period 46 demand at only 19 units, following a stable post-Black Friday regime of ~30-40 units. This is a low-seasonal trough typical after the holiday shopping period. (a) World knowledge: Post-Christmas retail demand for apparel typically slumps as consumers reduce discretionary spending. (b) Demand regime: Current regime is 20-40 units/period. (c) Lead time: Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; however, the most critical factor is the massive pipeline. (d) Inventory assessment: On-hand inventory is 178 units, which covers 4-6 periods of current demand without any new arrivals. The 'In-transit' of 1730 includes 1500 units definitively lost from P22 and earlier, and 230 units from P44-P45 which are still within the viable delivery window. (e) Order logic: With 178 units on hand and 230 units in the viable pipeline against a demand regime of ~30, the stock-to-service ratio is extremely high.
