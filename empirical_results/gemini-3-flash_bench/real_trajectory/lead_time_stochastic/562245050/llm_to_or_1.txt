Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/02/11). The product is 'Luna skinny RW', a women's 5-pocket denim trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 67 units/week with a slight downward trend (97 to 55). I will use the last 5 samples to capture this recent behavior. The promised lead time (L) is 2. My target base stock must cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to account for the order review cycle plus the delivery window. Given profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the backend will aim for a 50% service level by default (z=0), but the OR logic will handle the trade-off. Since no shipments are in-transit yet, I will use the default lead time and recent history for demand estimation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period (P1), we ordered 96 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 2, those units are expected to arrive in Period 3 and become visible in the P3 conclude message. Current inventory is 0, and we missed 45 units of demand in P1 due to zero stock. Historical demand (Jan 7 - Feb 4) shows a mean of 66.8 units/week. However, P1's actual demand was 45. To be conservative while accounting for the upcoming stock arrival, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the pre-game and early game demand profile. I will set the lead time to 'default' (2) as we have no evidence yet to suggest otherwise. The target is to ensure we have enough stock to cover the replenishment cycle (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand data (Jan-Feb) shows an average of ~67 units/week. Current demand in P1 and P2 was 45 and 77 (avg 61), which is consistent. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (96 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase, and the order from P2 (69 units) in P4. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) because the first order hasn't arrived yet, leading to lost sales. Using recent_N for demand (N=5 from the provided history) and default for lead time (2). The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=3 weeks of demand (~201 units). Given profit=1 and holding=1, the service level targeted by the OR backend is 50%, which is appropriate for a high-cost holding environment relative to profit.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a women's skinny jean. Historical demand shows a baseline of around 66 units/week (Jan-Feb), but recent demand has spiked significantly: P1=45, P2=77, P3=134. This likely reflects a seasonal uptick as we enter March (Spring fashion cycle). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 182 units in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The orders from Period 1 (96 units) were placed with L=2, so they are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 (this period's conclude message) and be available for sale in Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. Based on the timing rule, P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3 and be visible in 'P3 conclude'. Since 'P3 conclude' says arrived=0, and P1 was ordered 3 periods ago, the shipment is either delayed or the actual lead time is longer than promised. To ensure we recover from stockouts and account for the demand spike, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (avg ~85) to capture the trend, and setting L to explicit 3 to account for the observed delay in the P1 shipment arrival.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's 5-pocket jeans (Womens Everyday Collection). Demand is trending upwards sharply: from ~45-60 in early Feb to 134 and 124 in late Feb/early March. The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~112. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 273 in-transit (Orders from P1, P3, and P4). At Period 5, we expect the Period 3 order (17 units) to arrive, which is insufficient for the current demand levels of >100 units/period. The pipeline needs to be aggressive to catch up with the realized demand growth. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volume increase and higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~55-60 (pre-Feb) to ~110-130 (+100%) starting late February.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a pair of women's skinny jeans. I observe a significant demand shift that started in late February (Period 3), with demand jumping from an average of ~67 to ~130. The carry-over insight correctly notes this shift. Regarding lead times: the order from P2 arrived in P4 (L=2), consistent with the promised lead time. The order from P1 (96 units) is now 3 periods past its placement and has not arrived; given the 'conclude' logic, if it hasn't arrived by now, it is likely lost. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stocking out for three of the last four periods due to the demand spike and the missing P1 shipment. To recover, I need to set parameters based on the new demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the ~130 demand level and sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. I will use the default lead time (L=2) as the P2 arrival confirms it is functional despite the P1 loss. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~390 units), which will trigger a large order to replenish the pipeline and address the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed loss of Period 1 shipment (96 units) - no arrival recorded after 5 periods. Demand regime stable at ~130 units/period since Period 3.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 7 (2019/3/25), the demand for women's denim continues to show a strong upward trend, consistent with spring seasonal transitions. The last four periods of demand (134, 124, 134, 141) show a stable mean of approximately 133 units, confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. Inventory management is currently strained due to the loss of the Period 1 order (96 units) and recent stockouts (sold 62 of 141 required in Period 6). We see a lead time variance: Period 4 arrival took 2 periods, while Period 6 arrival from Period 5 took 1 period. To stabilize, I am setting L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current 133-unit mean. With L=2, mu_hat targets (1+2)*133 = 399 units. This will help the OR backend generate orders to recover from the lost shipment and meet high sustained demand while accounting for the current zero on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~133 units/period (last 4 periods: 134, 124, 134, 141). Lead time remains volatile (observed 1 and 2 periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/04/01), the SKU 562245050 is experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand spiked significantly in Period 7 to 210 units, up from the previously stable mean of ~133 (a ~57% increase). This likely reflects a seasonal shift into April (spring clothing demand for jeans). Given the high demand and existing stockouts, I must adjust the mu_hat to account for this higher volume. Recent lead times have been 1-2 periods, although the Period 1 order is confirmed lost. The in-transit pipeline is 400 units (from orders in Periods 3, 4, 6, and 7). To prevent further stockouts and satisfy the increased demand, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~152 units/period) and explicitly set L=2 (promised) to stabilize the order logic, as the OR engine needs to cover (L+1) periods of this higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Major demand spike observed at start of April (Period 7 demand = 210), shifting the 4-period moving average to ~152 units/period (+15% vs previous regime).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). Recent demand data shows a significant escalation: Period 7 (210) and Period 8 (223). This represents a new regime shift compared to the earlier March average of ~133. The last 4 periods average ~177, while the last 2 average ~216. Given the product is 'skinny RW jeans' and it is early April, we are likely seeing a spring seasonal peak. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (Period 5 arrived in 1, Period 6 in 2, Period 7 in 1). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 330 (which includes orders from Period 8 and likely Period 4/3 remnants if not lost). However, looking at the history, Period 3 (ordered 17) and Period 4 (ordered 160) shipments are significantly overdue, suggesting they are likely lost. To ensure we meet the current high demand of ~220 units/period, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the immediate spike, and L to 2 to be conservative against lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 8/9: Demand surged to ~215+ units/period in April, up from ~133 in March (+60%). Shipments from Period 3 and 4 are now highly likely lost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are managing 'Luna skinny RW' jeans. Historical demand data and 'Carry-over insights' indicate a significant demand regime shift in April, likely due to spring seasonality. Demand in the last three periods (P7-P9) was 210, 223, and 188, averaging ~207 units/period. This is a ~55% increase from the March average of ~133. We are currently facing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity is 623, but Carry-over insights flag that orders from Period 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 273 units) are likely lost. The viable pipeline is likely only 350 units (P8, P9 orders). Promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observations show volatility between 1 and 2 periods (calculate method is appropriate). To address the new demand level and recover from the stockout, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the recent April average of ~207 units across (L+1)=3 periods (Total ~621). This provides a strong signal to the OR backend to increase order volume, while the sigma_hat is adjusted using recent_N (N=3) to capture high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: April demand regime solidified: average ~207 units/period (P7-P9), confirming a +55% increase over March (~133). Severe stockout continues; total likely lost units in transit confirmed at 273 (P1, P3, P4).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), the system shows 143 units on hand after satisfying a demand of 207 in Period 10. The April demand regime (Periods 7-10) is significantly higher than previous months, averaging approximately 207 units per period. The recent arrival history confirms that lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (Period 8 arrived in 2, Period 9 arrived in 1). However, we must address the 'In-transit' balance of 273 units, which corresponds to the orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4. Given that it has been 7-10 periods since those orders were placed, they are officially considered lost. Since the OR backend includes these lost units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, it would normally under-order. To compensate and ensure we maintain stock for the upcoming weeks of the April/May regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~207 * 3 = 621) plus an additional offset of 273 to neutralize the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. 621 + 273 = 894. I use a slightly higher sigma_hat (recent_N=4) to account for the high volatility seen in the April surge.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (womens skinny jeans) is experiencing high demand in April, with Period 11 demand hitting a peak of 270 units. The average demand for the last four periods (P8-P11) is approximately 222 units, confirming a significant regime shift compared to March. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent arrivals (P10) show lead times of 1 and 2 periods are still occurring, but older orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 273 units) have not arrived and are considered lost in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, as they are well beyond the promised 2-period window. To compensate for these lost units and the increased demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the April demand surge (~222/period). This will set the base stock level (for L+1 = 3 periods) to roughly 666 units. With 'In-transit' at 595 (which includes the lost 273 units), the OR backend's capped policy will likely trigger an order to cover the current deficit and the high forward demand forecast, while accounting for the high pipeline (even the lost parts of it).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized in late April (P8-P11): Average demand increased to ~222 units/period (+66% vs March avg of ~133). Observed lead times oscillate between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand analysis: The most recent demand regime (Periods 8-12) shows an average demand of ~219 units/period (223, 188, 207, 270, 206), compared to the March average of ~133. This represents a sustained increase in demand for this SKU ('Luna skinny RW' jeans). Inventory status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is significantly high at 666 units. Let's trace the pipeline: P11 order (322 units, ordered Period 11) is expected in Period 13 or 14 (Lead time is 1-2 periods). P12 order (71 units) is expected in Period 14 or 15. The system shows 666 units 'in-transit', which includes the lost units from P1 (96), P3 (17), P4 (160), and possibly P5 (though P5 was only 62 units and arrived). Total likely phantom in-transit (lost orders) is approximately 273 units. Removing these from the reported 666 leaves ~393 units actually expected (P11=322 + P12=71). To parameters: I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile 1-2 period actual lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (capturing the April-May regime) to target the current demand level of ~219/period. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility in the new regime. Since profit = holding cost ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning base stock effectively targets the mean demand over (L+1) periods, while the OR safety cap provides protection against over-ordering due to the large 'phantom' pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday Jeans) showed a significant upward shift in April to ~222 units/period, but Period 13 saw a drop to 145 units. Given this SKU belongs to an 'Everyday Collection', demand is likely stabilizing around or slightly above 200 units rather than continuing a high-growth spring surge. The average demand from Period 8-13 is ~206.5 units. Current on-hand is 177, and in-transit is 344 (Period 12 order of 71 units + Period 13 order of 273 units). Based on history, observed lead times are 1-2 periods. I am setting L=2 (promised) and mu_hat to cover a stable forecast of ~195 units/period (3 periods total), which approximates the average of the last 6 periods. Sigma_hat is set using the last 6 periods to capture the recent high volatility (standard deviation ~42), which helps the backend manage safety stock against demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-April surge: Avg demand (P8-P13) is ~206 units, though P13 dropped to 145. Lead times remain consistent at 1-2 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the demand for 'Luna skinny RW' jeans appears to have entered a post-peak stabilization phase following the April surge. Average demand from Period 8 to Period 14 is approximately 204 units per period (223, 188, 207, 270, 206, 145, 189). While Period 13 saw a dip to 145, Period 14 rebounded slightly to 189. Lead times are consistently between 1 and 2 periods (P11 arrived in 2, P12 arrived in 2), confirming the promised lead time L=2 is a reliable parameter. Current inventory is low (59 on-hand) with 471 units in-transit (99 from P14 + 372 current total). Note that 273 units from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and have been effectively cleared from the 'effective' pipeline by the OR engine over time, but I must ensure the parameters account for the current demand level. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime of ~200 units/period (totaling ~600 for L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-April surge (P8-P14): Mean demand is ~204 units/period, down slightly from the absolute April peak but significantly higher than the March average of ~133. Lead times L=1 to 2 periods confirmed.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Everyday jeans) has stabilized following an April peak. Since Period 8 (early April), demand has averaged 204 units/period, despite a brief dip in Period 13. I'm using N=8 for 'recent_N' to capture this current regime (P8 to P15). Lead times have been consistently between 1 and 2 periods (arriving on schedule), which is in line with the promised lead time of 2. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, while 553 units are in transit (composed of orders from P14: 99 units, P15: 181 units, and likely older lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 totaling 273 units). The OR engine will subtract the 'In-transit' quantity from the calculated base stock. Because the backend is unaware of lost shipments, it see a high 'pipeline_inventory' and will likely order zero or very little. To force a corrective order to cover the current stockout and expected demand of ~200 units/period, I am setting 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' based on the recent 8-period mean and volatility to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the 'ghost' inventory in transit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17 (2019/6/3), we have zero on-hand inventory and 611 units in-transit. Historic arrivals show that orders from P1, P3, and P4 (total 273 units) are lost, while all later orders have arrived with a lead time of 1-2 periods. The 611 units in-transit comprise orders from P14 (99 units - overdue), P15 (181 units), and P16 (58 units). The backend's 'pipeline_inventory' likely includes the 273 lost units (P1, P3, P4), which will cause it to underestimate the necessary order unless we adjust parameters to compel ordering. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime phase since early April (Period 8). From P8 to P16, the mean demand is 207 units/period. Period 16 demand was 237, showing continued strength into June. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this current high-demand regime (P8-P16) to ensure mu_hat reflects the ~207 level. L is set to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the volatility in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 8 (April): Mean demand ~207 units/period. Evidence: P8-P16 average is 206.5 units, significantly higher than Mar avg (~133).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 8 (April) with a mean demand of approximately 207 units per period (P8-P17 avg = 204.4 units). While individual periods fluctuate (P13: 145, P16: 237), there is no sustained evidence of a new shift in June. Observed lead times continue to oscillate between 1 and 2 periods, with the most recent arrivals (Period 17) showing lead times of 2 periods (from P15) and 1 period (from P16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 52 units, and in-transit inventory is 383 (representing the order from Period 17 and likely lost or significantly delayed units from Periods 1, 3, and 4). I will set N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable April-June regime (Phase 3). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility of this high-demand period. L will remain 'calculate' to reflect the average of the 1-2 period actual delivery times observed.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period starting 2019-06-17 follows the regime established in April (Period 8). The average demand from Period 8 to Period 18 is approximately 200.3 units per period. While the most recent sample (P18) was lower at 141, the overall trend since April remains around the ~200 mark. Lead times have consistently been 1 or 2 periods (calculated average of recent arrivals is 1.6 periods). The system shows 564 units in transit, but this includes the likely lost shipments from P1 (96 units), P3 (17 units), and P4 (160 units), totaling 273 lost units. Thus, the real projected pipeline is 564 - 273 = 291 units. My current on-hand is 0. Using a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 focusing on the post-April regime (N=11) will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the L+1 window of ~600 units (3 periods * 200). With 291 active in-transit units, the backend should trigger a replenishment order to meet the target.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed post-April demand regime (P8-P18) remains stable at an average of ~200 units per period. Total lost units in transit confirmed at 273 (P1, P3, P4).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since April (Period 8), with an average demand of approximately 201 units per period (P8-P19 average = 200.5). Recent demand in Period 19 was 218 units, reinforcing this level. Lead times continue to oscillate between 1 and 2 periods (Period 18 order arrived in 1 period; Period 15/16 arrived in 2/1). I will continue using N=12 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this stable post-April regime. Pipeline inventory is currently 417 units (inclusive of Period 19's order of 34 units and Period 17's 11 units, plus likely older pending units), but we must recall that 273 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR backend does not know these are lost, so it sees a larger 'pipeline' than actually exists. By setting L to 2 (promised) and using recent_N for mu and sigma, I ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current high-demand environment, while the OR's internal capping and pipeline subtraction will be moderated by the consistent demand signal.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable demand regime established since Period 8 (early April). The mean demand from Period 8 to Period 20 is 199.23 units per period. The most recent demand (P20) was lower at 136, but this follows a standard pattern of volatility within the current regime rather than a shift. In-transit inventory stands at 603 units, which includes orders from P17 (11 units), P19 (34 units), and P20 (186 units), along with the explicitly identified lost units (273 units from P1, P3, P4) and potentially the P14 order (99 units) which is now 7 periods overdue. Observed lead times are oscillating between 1 and 2 periods. Since R=H ($1), the target cycle service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should align closely with the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). Given the pipeline is heavily inflated by lost/overdue shipments (at least 372 units), the OR backend's capped policy needs to account for this. Setting L to the mode of 2 and mu_hat based on the stable April-June regime (recent_N=13) will provide the most accurate base for the backend's calculation.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established in Period 8 (April) has shown a slight downward trend in the last few periods (P18-P21 demand: 141, 218, 136, 118), bringing the 4-period average to 153.25, compared to the overall April-June average of ~207. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 603 units, which includes 273 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4) and active shipments from P17 (11 units), P19 (34 units), and P20 (186 units). Correcting for lost units, the effective pipeline is 330 units. Given the 2-period promised lead time and recent observations of 1-2 periods, I will set L to 'calculate'. For demand (mu_hat), I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the recent cooling of demand while maintaining enough history to cover the (L+1) period risk. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend observed in July: Average demand for P20-P21 is ~127 units/period, significantly lower than the P8-P19 average of ~200.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Trousers) has shifted noticeably downward in July. Post-April/June average was ~200 units, but the last three periods (P20-P22) have recorded 136, 118, and 90 units. This suggests a significant cooling trend as we move into mid-summer, contrasting with the high-demand spring period. To avoid over-ordering and incurring high holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward regime shift (current 3-week average is ~115 units/period). Lead time remains stable between 1-2 periods, so I will continue using the 'calculate' method to track the average observed lead time. Pipeline inventory (417 units) is currently high relative to the new demand level, so the OR back-end will naturally moderate ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in July: Mean demand dropped from ~200 (April-June) to ~115 units/period (P20-P22), representing a -42% reduction.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 24 is confirmed to be in a cooling phase compared to the April-June peak. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P20-P23) is approximately 118 units/period (136, 118, 90, 128), which is significantly lower than the previous ~200 average. This shift justifies a reduction in the mu_hat parameter to avoid excess holding costs, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory stands at 417 units; however, historical data confirms that 273 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are almost certainly lost and will not arrive. The active pipeline consists of units ordered from P17 onwards that haven't arrived yet (P17: 11, P19: 34, and any subsequent orders not shown as arrived). My goal is to set the base stock to cover the (L+1) period demand of ~118 units/period while accounting for the lost shipments in the OR backend's calculation.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245050 has undergone a significant regime shift. After the high-demand period from April to June (averaging ~200 units/period), July (Periods 20-24) shows a clear cooling trend with demand values: 136, 118, 90, 128, 119. The mean for these last five periods is approximately 118 units/period. The current stock status is 0 on-hand with 417 units in-transit (orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost and effectively removed from the OR logic's pipeline calculation by the OR backend Recap rules, but the remaining in-transit orders from P19 onwards are still within reasonable timeframes). Observed lead times are mostly 1 or 2 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised) as it remains the most reliable ceiling. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new lower demand regime (~118 units/period) to avoid over-ordering as the product enters a slower phase. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand regime shift from ~200 to ~118 units/period confirmed (P20-P24). Product entering a lower-demand stability phase after July cooling.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245050 has clearly shifted downwards starting in July (Period 20). The average demand for the most recent six periods (P20-P25) is approximately 110.8 units/period, compared to the ~200 units/period seen during the April-June peak. This cooling trend is consistent with seasonal transitions for 'Womens Everyday' skinny jeans as summer progresses towards late August. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 417 units in transit, most of which include the likely lost shipments from early periods (P1, P3, P4 totaling 273 units). Subtracting these lost units, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 144 units (ordered between P19-P25 but largely dominated by the zero orders in recent weeks). Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory in its calculation, and the pipeline is artificially inflated by lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock that ensures orders are triggered despite the high 'in-transit' number. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current 111 units/period regime, multiplied by (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~111 units/period since Period 20, a significant drop from the previous ~200 units/period peak. Lost units from P1, P3, and P4 remain in 'In-transit' totaling 273 units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245050' is currently in a sustained low-demand regime. Since Period 20, demand has dropped from a peak of ~200 units/period to an average of ~103 units/period (last 7 periods: 136, 118, 90, 128, 119, 74, 56). The most recent few periods (P25-P26) even suggest a further deceleration below 100. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture this stable March-July-August transition (mean ~103). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the decreased volatility associated with this lower demand level. Regarding inventory, On-hand is 0. In-transit is 417 units, but 273 of these (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. The OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount when calculating the final order; because 273 units are phantom inventory that will never arrive, the system is likely under-ordering. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period lead time. No arrivals have occurred recently because no orders were placed between Period 21 and Period 26. I must Resume ordering to prevent further stockouts in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~103 units/period since Period 20 (recent sessions show further cooling). Verified 273 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4) remain lost and should be accounted for as phantom inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245050 has settled into a lower regime since Period 20, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P20-P27 average is ~99). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 417 units includes 273 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost (as noted in long-term carry-over insights). Subtracting these lost units, the 'real' pipeline inventory is 144 units (arising from orders in P14, P17, P19, though some of these might also be delayed/lost given the gap). To resume supply for the current demand regime (~100 units/period), I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the July/August cooling accurately. Lead time remains approximately 1.5 periods on average, so L is kept at 'calculate'. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to reflect the current period-over-period volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Luna skinny RW jeans' is currently in a lower demand regime which began in Period 20 (late June/July). The average demand from Period 23 to 28 is approximately 87 units/period, showing a steady cooling from the previous peak of ~200. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 417 units. However, consistent with previous 'Carry-over insights', 273 units (from Period 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Furthermore, orders placed in Period 14 (99 units), Period 17 (11 units), and Period 19 (34 units) have not arrived for over 10 periods, meaning they are also lost. This totals 417 units in-transit (273 + 99 + 11 + 34), implying zero 'true' inventory in the pipeline. I need to trigger a new order to meet the current demand of ~87 units/period. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current stable cooling trend and set L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 1 or 2 periods when orders actually arrive. The OR backend will treat the 417 units as pipeline, so my parameters must be high enough to overcome this phantom stock or I must use 'explicit' to force a stock-up. Given I cannot directly clear the OR engine's pipeline memory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand PLUS the phantom units (Approx 87 * 3 + 417 = 678) to ensure the Capped Policy generates an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Verified all 417 units 'In-transit' are lost/phantom shipments (P1=96, P3=17, P4=160, P14=99, P17=11, P19=34). Current demand regime is stable at ~87 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 562245050 (Luna skinny jeans) is currently in a stable low-demand phase following a significant peak in April-June. The current demand regime has stabilized at an average of approximately 87 units per period since Period 25 (P25: 74, P26: 56, P27: 71, P28: 73, P29: 63). Period 30 falls in early September, which historically for this region and category (Women's Trousers) remains stable before any potential autumn/winter transition. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 678 units. Based on historical data, 417 units are confirmed lost/phantom shipments (P1=96, P3=17, P4=160, P14=99, P17=11, P19=34). Subtracting these from the total 678 leaves 261 real units in-transit (ordered in Period 29), which are expected to arrive in Period 30 or 31. Since on-hand is 0 and we have substantial real orders arriving, parameters are set to maintain coverage for this lower regime while accounting for the high phantom inventory that the OR backend would otherwise misinterpret as available supply. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current ~87 units/period average and explicit lead time L=2 to reflect the conservative promised time, as observed lead times fluctuate.

The SKU is currently transitioning into a stable lower-demand regime for the early autumn/September period. Demand has cooled significantly from the ~200 units/period peak (April-June) and has been consistent around ~70-90 units/period over the last 10 periods (P21-P30). Recent demand (P29-P30) shows ~66 units/period. The 'In-transit' count of 678 is highly misleading as it includes 417 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19) which will never arrive. Subtracting those, the 'real' pipeline is 261 units (ordered in P29), which are expected to arrive in P31 or P32 given the L=2 promised lead time. Since the mean demand is ~70-80, the current pipeline of 261 covers more than 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3), so no new order is necessary. To prevent the OR backend from placing an unnecessary order based on the inflated 'In-transit' number, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to signal the correct base stock level for the current demand regime, effectively neutralizing the phantom inventory influence.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed total lost/phantom units in-transit is 417 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19). Current demand regime is now firmly stable at ~70 units/period (P25-P30 average).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '562245050' is currently in a lower-demand stability phase as it enters mid-September. Recent demand (P25-P31: 74, 56, 71, 73, 63, 70, 52) shows a stable average of approximately 65-70 units per period, down from the mid-year peak. The 'In-transit' count of 678 units is highly misleading due to accumulated 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments that are confirmed lost. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, and P19 (totaling 417 units) are certainly lost. Additionally, the order placed in P29 (261 units) should have arrived by P31 if lead time was 2 periods. Since it hasn't arrived yet, on-hand remains 0. To recover from the stockout induced by relying on phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 7-period average (~65) and leave L at the promised 2 periods to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~195 units). The backend will subtract the current pipeline (678 units) from the base stock. Because 678 is much larger than the needed base stock, the OR engine will likely order 0. However, by properly setting mu_hat and sigma_hat for the current regime, we ensure that as soon as the OR engine realizes the P29 order is late or lost, it will trigger the correct replenishment volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Confirmed demand regime further cooled to ~65 units/period (P25-P31 average). Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) now likely includes the P29 order if it does not arrive by P33, adding to the previous 417 confirmed lost units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Luna skinny RW' (Womens Trousers) has significantly cooled from its April-June peak (~200 units/period) to a stable lower regime. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P25-P32) is approximately 63 units/period. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 678 is highly misleading: history confirms a substantial amount of 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P1=96, P3=17, P4=160, P14=99, P17=11, P19=34, and now likely P29=261 which is overdue). Total confirmed/likely lost units equals 678, matching the current in-transit total. This means there is NO effective inventory coming. With on-hand at 0, a new order is required. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current low-demand stability (avg ~63), and using explicit L=2 to reflect the promised lead time while accounting for the recent unreliability by ensuring the backend targets a full (L+1) window of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Current in-transit (678 units) is confirmed as 100% phantom inventory/lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29). Demand regime is stable at ~63 units/period (P25-P32 average).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU has entered a lower-stability phase since July, with the average demand over the last 9 periods (P25-P33) being approximately 62.7 units. The current inventory situation is critical as the OR backend reports 678 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are ghost/lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, and now likely P29). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is effectively 0 (due to losses), the OR engine needs to order to meet the base stock levels. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture the current stable demand of ~63 units/period. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=9 to reflect the current period's lower volatility compared to the April peak. I use L='calculate' to let the backend use observed arrival times (historically 1 or 2 periods). These settings will trigger an order to refill the depleted on-hand inventory and cover the lead time + review period demand (~189 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Verified the P29 order (261 units) is now likely lost as it has not arrived within 5 periods, bringing total phantom in-transit inventory to 678 units. The demand regime remains stable at ~63 units/period (P25-P33 average).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 562245050 has reached a stable lower regime following a significant drop from the April-June peak. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approximately 63 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory of 678 units is confirmed as entirely comprised of lost or phantom shipments (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29). Since these units will never arrive, the OR backend must be tricked into ignoring them by setting an 'explicit' L that is very high, which makes the pipeline inventory less impactful in the capped policy formula, or by adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat. However, because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory (678) from the calculated base stock, a standard L=2 with mu_hat=189 (3*63) would result in zero orders. To overcome the 678 phantom units and replenish stock for a 3-period window (Review + Lead Time), mu_hat is set to 867 (678 + 3*63) using the 'explicit' method. This ensures the backend emits an order of approximately 189 units. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility of the low-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a significantly lower level compared to its April-June peak. Over the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the average demand is approximately 58.4 units per period, with the most recent sample (P35) dropping further to 31. This indicates a cooling trend into the autumn season for this 'everyday collection' denim item. Regarding inventory, there is a severe discrepancy: 678 units from orders placed on P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29 are confirmed as lost or phantom inventory (pipeline visibility only). These units will never arrive but are counted by the OR backend as supply. The current In-transit balance of 867 units includes these 678 lost units plus the recently placed order of 189 units from P35. To compensate for the 678 phantom units and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the true current demand mean at ~55 units. For a lead time of 2, the desired base stock should be (1+L)*mu = 3*55 = 165. However, since the OR engine sees 867 units in-transit, it will not place a new order unless the base_stock > 867. To force the engine to maintain coverage for the current regime and ignore the 678 phantom units, I adjust mu_hat to (678 [phantom] + 165 [actual need]) = 843 roughly. For safety, I will target a mu_hat that reflects the current demand (55 units) while setting sigma to preserve a standard service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand regime in autumn (Oct) has cooled further to ~58 units/period (P25-P35 avg). Total confirmed phantom 'In-transit' inventory matches the P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29 orders, totaling 678 units. These must be offset in parameter selection to ensure new orders are triggered.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Luna skinny jeans has specialized into a low-volume stability phase for the autumn season. Recent demand (P30-P36) averages approximately 48 units per period, which is a decline from the earlier summer average of ~110. The current on-hand inventory is 149 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' total of 678 units is confirmed as phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29), as these have not arrived despite substantial lead-time passage. Since the OR backend includes all 'In-transit' units in its pipeline inventory logic, these 678 phantom units effectively block any new orders. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the phantom inventory volume plus the desired safety stock for the current regime. Required base stock = (Current Pipeline + Needed Pipeline). To trigger an order if needed or maintain the current status, I calculate: Target Base Stock \u2248 (L+1)*48. However, because on-hand (149) + phantom in-transit (678) = 827, the OR backend sees a pipeline of 827. Setting mu_hat to 850 via 'explicit' ensures the backend doesn't perceive a massive overstock that prevents future necessary orders as demand fluctuates, while sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the current low volatility (std dev ~13 in recent periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed phantom inventory now totals 678 units. The autumn demand regime (Oct) is stable at ~48 units/period (P30-P36 average), significantly lower than previous months.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a significantly lower level than the April-June peak. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P30-P37) is approximately 49.75 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 107 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' column shows 701 units, but based on historical evidence and previous carry-over insights, 678 of these units are confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29). Only the order from P37 (23 units) is likely legitimate. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly assuming we have a massive surplus, I must set the lead time (L) and demand parameters to reflect the current regime while ensuring the inventory target accounts for the lost units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current low-demand autumn phase (~50 units/period). Given Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the base stock will target the 50th percentile (the mean). Using N=8 provides a stable yet responsive estimate for the current stabilized cooling trend.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed 678 units in-transit are lost (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P29). Recent demand (P30-P37) is stable at ~50 units/period, down from earlier months.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (5-pocket skinny jeans) has reached a stable low-demand phase in the autumn (November), with an average demand of approximately 45 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P34-P38: 47, 31, 40, 42, 39). The current on-hand inventory is 91 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 678 units is confirmed as phantom inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29). Since the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to override this. Specifically, because on-hand (91) covers roughly 2 periods of current demand (45 * 2 = 90) and the promised lead time is 2, the current inventory is barely sufficient. To prevent the backend from seeing the 678 phantom units as available stock and therefore never ordering, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the desired base stock (Demand * (L+1)) PLUS the phantom inventory. Target base stock = 45 * 3 = 135. Adjusted mu_hat = 135 + 678 = 813. This ensures the OR engine calculates an order if needed. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand appears stable at ~45 units/period in the Nov timeframe. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains 678 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a significantly lower level compared to its April-June peak. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), average demand is approximately 48.3 units. The most recent demand at Period 39 was 46 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture this lower autumn/late-year stability. Regarding inventory, there are 722 units listed as 'In-transit'. However, based on longitudinal observation, 678 of these units are confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29) that have failed to arrive for many weeks. Only the Period 39 order (44 units) is likely to arrive. To force the OR backend to place necessary orders, I must set mu_hat at a level that overcomes the 678 phantom units in the pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). With L=1.5 (average of 1 and 2), base_stock is roughly (1+L)*mu. To ensure an order is triggered when on-hand is low, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to be around 760 (to cover 678 phantom units + ~82 units for current cycle safety). Setting mu_hat to 760 with L=default (2) implies a per-period demand estimate adjusted to clear the phantom inventory bottleneck.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed total phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains at 678 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P29). Demand regime for Nov is stable around 48 units/period (P30-P39 average).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late November (Period 41). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 30, with the last 11 periods (P30-P40) averaging approximately 49.3 units per period. The most recent demand (P40) was 59, slightly above average but consistent with the late autumn range. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 722 units is heavily skewed by 678 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 14, 17, 19, and 29) which will never arrive. The only valid shipment is the 44 units ordered in Period 39, which is expected to arrive in Period 41 (L=2). To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the phantom 678 units, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Usually, mu_hat = (1+L)*demand, but since the pipeline is full of phantom units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the backend's subtraction of pipeline inventory (722 units). Target base stock = (1+L)*Forecast + Phantom Units \u2248 (3 * 50) + 678 = 828. Setting mu_hat to 830 to force a replenishment order that covers the current demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P41) has stabilized at a lower level, averaging approximately 48 units per period as we move into late November. The most recent period (P41) showed even lower demand at 26 units, but I will maintain a mu_hat based on the late autumn average (~48) to avoid under-stocking. The 'In-transit' level is significantly inflated by 678 units of confirmed phantom inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29 that never arrived). Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' methods to override this. To trigger an order that covers demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods * 48 = 144 units) while neutralizing the 786 in-transit units, I set mu_hat to approximately 144 + 786 = 930. Sigma_hat is set to a standard level for this demand regime. Lead time remains consistent between 1 and 2 periods, so I use the default promised lead time of 2.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 42 was 130, which is significantly higher than the previous 10-period average of ~45. This spike coincides with the start of the holiday shopping season (late November). Looking at the historical year-to-date trend, the product fluctuates between stable regimes and sharp peaks. The current in-transit inventory of 912 units is primarily composed of phantom/lost shipments (678 units from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29). Subtracting this phantom inventory from the total in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 234 units (from P41 and P42). Given the jump to 130 units, I am adjusting the forecast (mu_hat) to anticipate sustained holiday demand around 120-130 units/period. The prompt's formula for the order is 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. To trigger an order despite the 678 phantom units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock calculation, effectively offsetting the phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Holiday demand spike detected in late November (P42 demand 130 vs P30-P41 average of ~45). Confirmed total phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains 678 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak December holiday season. We observed a significant demand spike in Period 42 (130 units), which likely corresponds to Black Friday/late November promotions. While Period 43 demand was lower (30 units), we must anticipate higher average demand for the December weeks compared to the November baseline (~45-50 units). The total 'In-transit' quantity of 992 units includes significant phantom inventory: 678 units from older periods (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P29) are confirmed lost. Recent orders from P42 (126 units) and P43 (188 units) are still within the normal lead time window. Total reliable pipeline inventory = 126 (P42) + 188 (P43) = 314 units. Current on-hand is 78. To counteract the 678 phantom units in the OR backend's logic, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate forward-looking demand at ~90 units/period for the holiday peak. Adjusted mu_hat for L+1 (3 periods) = 270. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 992 'In-transit' units, I set mu_hat high enough to trigger the base stock logic: base_stock \u2248 mu_hat + z*sigma. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 1070. To force an order, mu_hat must technically exceed this, but the OR backend uses a capped policy. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to effectively bypass the 'In-transit' phantom inventory blockage, while relying on the backend's cap mechanism to prevent excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Holiday seasonality confirmed: demand spiked to 130 in P42. Estimated December demand regime at ~90 units/period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019/12/16), we are in the peak holiday season. Demand in Period 42 spiked to 130, and while Periods 43 and 44 showed lower demand (30 and 37), these likely represent mid-week figures or temporary dips before the final Christmas surge. The 'In-transit' figure of 1122 is heavily inflated by 678 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P29), meaning effective inventory is actually (41 on-hand + (1122 - 678) in-transit) = 485. The OR backend uses reported pipeline inventory, so to trigger necessary holiday replenishment, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 678 phantom units. I am estimating the holiday regime mean at 90 units/period. With L=2, the backend calculates base_stock against a pipeline of 1122. To ensure a positive order that covers the holiday peak despite phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 1300 (roughly 3 periods of demand + 678 phantom offset).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (P46, Dec 23). Historical data and dates show a holiday peak in late Nov (P42 demand=130), followed by a cooling to ~36 units in Dec. However, post-Christmas clearance and New Year's often see specific demand patterns for 'Everyday' trousers. On-hand is healthy (319) after arrivals from P42/P43. Total in-transit is 945, but based on carry-over insights, 678 units (P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, P29) are confirmed lost/phantom. This leaves valid in-transit at 267 (P44=130, P45=137). Total reliable inventory = 319 (on-hand) + 267 (valid in-transit) = 586 units. Lead time has recently shown L=2 or 3. Given the current demand level (~40/week), we have roughly 14 weeks of stock. No order is needed. To signal the OR backend to not order, I'll set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat based on the stable Dec demand (~40), but since phantom inventory is extremely high (678), it will naturally suppress ordering unless I use 'explicit' to override. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand average (~35-40), allowing the OR logic to recognize the high stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed valid inventory (On-hand + P44/P45 orders) is 586 units. Total phantom in-transit remains 678 units. Demand has cooled significantly in Dec to ~35-40 units/period following the late-Nov spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Dec 30 (P47), marking the end of the year and the post-holiday season. Demand has stabilized into a lower year-end regime following the Nov/Dec peak, with recent demand being 30, 37, 36, and 19 units. The mean for this recent 4-period window is ~30.5 units/period. On-hand inventory is 300 units, which is quite high relative to this demand. Regarding in-transit, we have 945 units total. However, as established in the carry-over insights, 678 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P14, P17, P19, and P29) are phantom inventory/lost shipments. The valid pipeline consists of orders from P44 (130 units) and P45 (137 units). Given the high on-hand stock (300) compared to current demand (~30), no new order is necessary. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 678 phantom units as valid and incorrectly thinking we are over-leveraged, but still respecting the reality that the engine will use them in its 'base stock - pipeline' calculation, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 5-period stable regime (P42-P46) while keeping the lead time at the default promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Post-holiday demand regime confirmed low (mean ~25-30 units/period over last 4 weeks). Pipeline correction: 678 units in-transit remain confirmed lost/phantom shipments.
