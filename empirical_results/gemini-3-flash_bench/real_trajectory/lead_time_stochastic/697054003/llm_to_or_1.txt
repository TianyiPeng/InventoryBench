Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Collection Blouse'. Historical data from the last 5 weeks shows a declining trend: 186, 132, 98, 86, 89. This suggests a post-holiday or post-early-spring-launch normalization. The mean of these 5 samples is approximately 118, but the most recent two weeks have stabilized around 87-89. Given the declining trend, using all historical samples (mean ~118) would likely over-order. I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the stabilized lower demand (avg ~91). Lead time is promised at 2 periods, and since there is no history of arrivals yet, I'll use the default promised lead time. This conservative approach balances the risk of holding costs (which equal profit per unit) against service level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's blouse from the 'Everyday Collection'. Initial demand observed at Period 1 was 79, following late January/early February demand between 86-89. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 102 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (concluded in Period 3, visible in Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (79 units). I will use the recent demand trend (last 5 samples including P1) to set mu_hat. Mean of [186, 132, 98, 86, 89, 79] shows a clear downward trend from January highs. Excluding the January peaks, the last 4 samples (86, 89, 79, and the trend) average ~85. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (2+1)=3 periods. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent stabilization following the post-New Year drop.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) was 186, 132, 98, 86, 89, followed by observed game demand of 79 and 130. The average weekly demand is approximately 114. The product is a blouse (Womens Everyday Collection), which typically sees steady demand in early spring. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 203 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order (102 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message. Since on-hand is zero and demand is exceeding the historical lows seen in late Jan, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat to capture the recent demand level (avg ~105 over last 3 periods) while maintaining the default lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture volatility without being skewed by the very high Jan 7th outlier.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU is a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend (P-2: 186, P-1: 132, P1: 79, P2: 130, P3: 150). The dip in Period 1 (79) seems to be a post-holiday lul, followed by a recovery as spring approaches. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (102 units) should have arrived during P3 and been visible at the start of P4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is likely \u2265 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales for 3 consecutive periods (sold=0), we must ensure the base stock is aggressive enough to cover the pipeline. I will set L=3 explicitly based on the non-arrival of the P1 order. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 3 periods to capture the recent upward trend (avg ~120/period). With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3)*120 = 480. Sigma_hat will also use the last 3 periods to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is currently at least 3 periods (Order P1 not arrived by P3 conclude). Demand is trending upward as of Feb/March.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 (Women's Blouse) is entering the spring season (March), where demand typically trends upward. Looking at the history, Period 4 demand was 116 units, but we were stock-constrained (sold out 101/101). Demand samples from late Jan/early Feb were lower (86-89) than the current active period (avg ~118 over last 4 periods). Lead time analysis: Order P1 (102 units) has not arrived in Period 4 conclude, but Order P2 (101 units) arrived with lead_time=2. This suggests Order P1 remains lost or significantly delayed, and the pipeline inventory might be 'hollow'. Since P1 is missing, I am treating the current in-transit (377) cautiously. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 demand samples (including the pre-game samples) to capture the upward trend since early Feb. L is set to explicit 2 based on the P2 arrival confirmation, though the P1 loss warrants a higher base stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility from stockouts and recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Order P1 (102 units) confirmed lost or severely delayed (was not in P4 conclude arrivals despite P2 arriving). Demand regime shift confirmed: Increasing trend from Feb (avg ~88) to March (avg ~118).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 18th. Demand for this women's blouse has shown a significant upward trend during February and March, likely due to spring seasonality. Historical demand samples (last 5 available: 186, 132, 98, 86, 89) combined with recent game history (130, 150, 116, 98) suggest a recent average demand around 120-130 units. Crucially, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced significant supply chain issues. Order P1 (102 units) is confirmed lost/overdue. Order P2 arrived with the promised lead time (2 periods). Order P3 (95 units) ordered in P3 was expected in P5 conclude, but did not arrive (arrived=0 in P5 conclude), confirming lead time variability or potential loss. Currently, 377 units are in-transit (P3: 95, P4: 180, P5: 0? No, Game history shows P4 ordered 180, P5 ordered 0. P3+P4 = 95+180 = 275. If In-transit is 377, there might be a discrepancy or an initial order not listed). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the current delay trend, use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime since the February uptick, and use 'calculate' for sigma to capture the volatility of this shifting demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1 order (ordered P1) lost; P3 order (ordered P3) delayed beyond promised 2 periods (not in P5 conclude). Actual lead time currently estimated at 3+ periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's blouse. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a shift from an average of ~88 in February to ~118 in March, likely driven by spring seasonality. Lead time is highly unstable: Order P1 (Period 1) is lost; Order P3 (ordered P3, promised lead time 2) should have arrived by Period 5 conclude but has not appeared in Period 5 or 6 conclude messages. Order P4 (ordered P4) is also pending. Because P3 is now overdue by 2 periods (actual LT >= 4), I will set L to 4 to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for a longer pipeline and current demand levels. I will use the recent demand regime (last 6 samples) to set mu_hat, reflecting the ~114 avg seen since Feb 18th.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed unstable: Period 1 order lost; Period 3 order delayed (not arrived by Period 6 conclude, implying LT >= 4). Demand regime shift maintained at ~114 units/week since mid-February.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 697054003 ('Womens Everyday Collection Blouse') is currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory and a large pipeline of 569 units. The primary issue is extreme lead time instability. The Period 1 order (102 units) is officially considered lost. The Period 3 order (95 units) is now 5 periods old (placed P3, not arrived by P7 conclude), meaning the actual lead time is at least 5 periods, far exceeding the promised 2. The only successful delivery was the Period 2 order arriving in Period 4 (LT=2). Demand since mid-February has averaged approximately 110 units (recent_N=6: 116, 98, 109, 91 plus previous samples). Because the backend OR calculates the order based on (In-transit + On-hand), and our In-transit (569) is huge due to delayed/lost orders, the OR might stop ordering unless we adjust the parameters. I will set L to 4 to reflect the persistent delays and use recent_N for demand to stabilize the forecast around the current 110/week level. This results in a mu_hat calculation of (1+4)*110 = 550, which helps signal to the model that the current pipeline is barely sufficient for the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed severely unstable and extended: Period 3 order (ordered P3) has not arrived by Period 7 conclude, indicating LT >= 5. Previous P1 order is lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 conclude, we observed two arrivals: the Period 6 order (117 units) arrived with lead_time=2, and the Period 7 order (75 units) arrived with lead_time=1. This resolves the extreme uncertainty regarding current lead times, showing that while the Period 1 and Period 3 orders are lost, recent shipments are arriving within or faster than the promised 2-period window. On-hand inventory now stands at 92 units with a total pipeline of 387. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 104 units over the last 8 periods (excluding initial 5 data points). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's base-stock logic (z=0) will target a 50% service level. To protect against the volatility shown by lost shipments while acknowledging recent fast arrivals, I am setting L to 2 (promised). I will use the last 8 periods of demand (Feb 11 - April 1) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current demand regime which is higher than the initial Jan data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time recovered to 1-2 periods in Period 8 conclude after severe instability (P1/P3 orders considered lost). Average demand since Period 1 is approximately 104 units/week.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we are managing a women's blouse. Historical demand shows a mean around 104 units since Period 1, with recent demand (last 3 periods) slightly lower at ~90 units. The inventory situation is critical: we have 11 units on-hand and 387 units in-transit. Lead time history shows significant instability: Period 1 and Period 3 orders are lost, while Period 6 and 7 orders arrived in Period 8 (LT of 2 and 1 respectively). This suggests lead time has returned to near the promised 2 periods, but the lost shipments created a massive stockout and a large pipeline. The current 387 units in-transit likely includes orders from Period 4 (180 units) and Period 8 (10 units), plus others. Given the high in-transit vs. the base stock needed for a ~100 unit demand SKU, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (excluding lost orders) and use recent_N for demand to capture the current stabilization around 104 units. This allows the backend to account for the massive pipeline and avoid over-ordering while maintaining service level for current demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time stabilization: After losses in P1 and P3, orders from P6 and P7 arrived with 1-2 period lead times. Pipeline inventory is currently very high (387 units) relative to a mean demand of ~104.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 2019-04-22. On-hand inventory is 0, while 377 units are in-transit (ordered in periods 4 and 5 but not yet arrived). Looking at history, the Period 4 order (180 units) and Period 5 order (0 units, but actually 180 is still outstanding) are significantly overdue. History shows Period 6, 7, and 8 orders arrived with lead times of 2, 1, and 2 periods respectively, but earlier orders (P1, P3) were lost and P4 remains missing. This suggests a pattern where orders are either on time (1-2 periods) or lost entirely. Demand has cooled down slightly from the Feb/March peak (avg down to 67-81 recently compared to earlier peaks of 130-150). However, the massive pipeline (377 units) vs. a weekly mean of ~100 units means we are likely over-supplied if those units ever arrive. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to account for the mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals seen recently. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the cooling demand trend while maintaining a safe stock level to recover from the current stockout, assuming the pipeline eventually clears.

Carry-over insight: Persistent inventory risk: Period 4 order (180 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, following the pattern of lost orders from Period 1 and 3. Average demand has stabilized around 80-90 units/week after the early spring peak.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 is currently facing stockout with 0 on-hand units and 377 units in-transit. Based on 'Period 11 conclude' and carry-over insights, orders from Period 1, 3, and 4 (total 102+95+180 = 377 units) are significantly overdue (7-11 periods) and should be considered lost. Since the OR backend includes these lost units in 'pipeline_inventory', it will not place new orders unless we adjust parameters to account for this deficit. Demand has stabilized around 85 units/week (last 5 weeks: 100, 81, 67, 85). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect this stabilization. Although promised lead time is 2, actual lead time for successful deliveries (P2, P6, P7, P8) has averaged ~1.75 periods, so I will stick to 'calculate' for L. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5, I am targeting a base stock that should trigger a compensatory order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory confirmation: Orders from Period 1 (102), Period 3 (95), and Period 4 (180) are definitively lost (6+ periods overdue), totaling 377 units that falsely inflate pipeline figures. Demand has decelerated from the spring peak to a stable range of 80-90 units/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU (a Blouse) is experiencing significant stockouts. On-hand inventory is 0, and the demand for the last period was 101 units. Analysis of order history confirms that three specific orders are lost: Period 1 (102 units), Period 3 (95 units), and Period 4 (180 units), totaling 377 units. These units are listed in 'In-transit' but have not arrived for 8-11 periods, far exceeding the promised 2-period lead time. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, it believes we are overstocked and is not placing new orders (ordered=0 for the last 3 periods). To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to a high 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom 377 in-transit units. Demand since mid-February has averaged ~95 units/week. Assuming a lead time of 2, the target inventory (L+1) should be 3 * 95 = 285 units. However, to bypass the 377 in-transit units and start replenishing, I will set mu_hat to 600 (representing roughly 4 periods of demand plus a buffer to overcome the phantom pipeline) and L to an explicit value of 2 to reflect the most recent successful deliveries. sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a healthy service level given recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory inaccuracy: 377 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost, causing the OR backend to underestimate required orders. Corrective explicit parameters are required until inventory records reconcile or these orders are manually offset.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) is facing a systemic inventory failure. The system shows 600 units in-transit, but historical data confirms that 377 of these units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) are definitively lost as they are 9-13 periods overdue. Only the P13 order (223 units) is live. The OR backend subtracts the full 600 units from the base stock target, leading to zero or insufficient ordering. Demand has stabilized at roughly 85-90 units/week (average of the last 4 periods is ~85). To force the backend to place an order that bypasses the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. My target base stock is (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2 and Demand=90, and a coefficient of variation to protect service levels, I set mu_hat (target across L+1 periods) to 670. This value, when reduced by the 600 'in-transit' units, should trigger an order of approximately 70-100 units to meet incoming demand, effectively discounting the lost units until they are flushed or on-hand increases.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Discrepancy: 600 total in-transit contains 377 'lost' units (P1, P3, P4). Effective 'live' pipeline is 223 units (P13). Parameters adjusted to offset this 377-unit inflation.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20th), the system reports an in-transit inventory of 670 units. However, consistent with previous 'Carry-over Insights', 377 units from Periods 1 (102), 3 (95), and 4 (180) are lost. This significantly inflates the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. The true 'live' pipeline consists of orders from Period 13 (223) and Period 14 (70), totaling 293 units. Since the lead time for Period 13 (L=2) means it should arrive during this period (visible next period), the available inventory is functionally zero at the time of decision. Demand has stabilized at roughly 88 units/week over the last 5 weeks (N=5). To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite the 377-unit phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean Demand + Safety. With L=2, (3 * 88) = 264. To offset the 377-unit discrepancy, I set mu_hat to 641 (264 + 377) which forces the backend calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) to reach the necessary order level. Sigma is kept at recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Discrepancy persistent: 377 units from P1, P3, P4 are lost. Effective pipeline is 293 units, not 670. Demand stable at ~88 units/week.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system faces a severe inventory discrepancy. We have 670 units 'In-transit', but 377 of these (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are confirmed lost, leaving a real pipeline of only 293 units (from Period 13 and 14). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (670) from the base stock, it will not place any orders, despite the 'real' pipeline being much lower and current on-hand being 0. To force an order, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to include the 377 'lost' units as a buffer, ensuring the backend calculation (base_stock - 670) results in the desired physical replenishment. Demand is steady at ~88 units/week. Target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (2+1)*88 = 264. To offset the phantom 377 units, I set mu_hat (the backend's base stock target) to approximately 264 + 377 = 641. Since we have 293 real units coming (223 from P13, 70 from P14) and 0 on-hand, this will ensure we don't stock out as those real units arrive soon.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains critical due to 377 units from Period 1, 3, and 4 being confirmed lost. These lost units inflate the 'In-transit' count to 670, while the actionable 'live' pipeline only consists of orders from P13 (223 units) and P14 (70 units), totaling 293 units. Since 'on-hand' is 0 and recent demand averages ~88 units/week, we must force the OR engine to place an order. However, given the current stockout and the fact that P13 and P14 orders are overdue (promised lead time is 2), we are likely facing a systematic shipment delay or further losses. To bypass the backend's incorrect pipeline count (670), I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the lost 377 units. Calculation: (Target Stock for 3 periods) + (Lost Units) = (3 * 88) + 377 = 641. This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock' target is high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom 377 units in the pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and 670 units in-transit. However, historical data reveals that the in-transit figure is severely inflated by lost shipments from Periods 1 (102), 3 (95), and 4 (180), totaling 377 ghost units. Furthermore, the orders placed in Periods 13 (223) and 14 (70) are now overdue (ordered over 4 periods ago), suggesting they may also be delayed or lost. This systemic inaccuracy means the OR backend, which calculates 'Order = Base Stock - Pipeline', sees 670 units that do not exist, resulting in zero new orders and persistent stockouts. Demand since Period 10 has averaged ~80 units per week. To force the OR engine to place an order and bypass the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (Effective Lead Time + 1) * Demand + Ghost Inventory. With L=2 and Demand=80, we need ~240 (real) + 377 (ghost) = 617. I will set mu_hat to 650 with high sigma to ensure the engine triggers a replenishment order immediately to break the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Discrepancy expanded: Orders from P13 (223) and P14 (70) are currently 4+ periods overdue, joining P1, P3, and P4 as potential losses. Total phantom pipeline now potentially exceeds 600 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697054003 is facing a severe systemic inventory failure. We are currently at Period 19 with 0 on-hand inventory and 670 units listed as In-transit. Historical analysis confirms that 377 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are definitively lost. Furthermore, orders from P13 (223 units) and P14 (70 units) are now 5-6 periods overdue, suggesting they are also lost or severely delayed. This implies the entire 670-unit pipeline is 'phantom' data. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, it sees 670 units in transit and refuses to order more, despite us having 0 stock and consistent stockouts. Recent demand has cooled but remains around 50-80 units/week. To force the OR backend to place an order and break this cycle, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate a safe lead-time demand (L+1 = 3 periods) of approximately 240 units (80 units/period). However, to overcome the 670-unit phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the pipeline + desired buffer. I've set mu_hat to 950 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure the policy triggers a significant replenishment order (approximately 280-300 units) to restore physical stock.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Discrepancy Critical: All 670 units currently in 'In-transit' (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) are 5+ periods overdue and confirmed lost or unusable. The OR backend is paralyzed by this phantom inventory. Explicit parameter overrides are mandatory to force replenishment.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for SKU 697054003 is critical due to a massive accumulation of phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' bucket. Currently, 950 units are listed as In-transit. However, detailed tracking confirms these are almost entirely lost or severely delayed: P1 (102), P3 (95), P4 (180), P13 (223), and P14 (70) are all far beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Only the order from P19 (280 units) is potentially 'live'. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - In-transit' to calculate orders, it perceives a surplus and will not order, despite on-hand inventory being 0. As of late June, demand has softened but remains around 70-100 units/week. To force the system to order and bypass the 950-unit phantom pipeline, I must set the mu_hat (target stock level) to a value high enough to exceed the In-transit figure. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) while offsetting the 950 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 1300 units (950 + 350 for demand). This will trigger a replenishment order to restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Discrepancy Extreme: 950 units In-transit are confirmed lost or unusable (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Only P19 order is pending. Explicit overrides are required to bypass phantom inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for SKU 697054003 is critical due to a massive accumulation of 'phantom inventory' (lost/severely delayed shipments). As of Period 21, In-transit stands at 1300 units, but historical data shows that orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 (totaling 670 units) are all 6+ periods overdue and definitively lost. Furthermore, the orders from P19 (280) and P20 (350) have not arrived yet, and given the unstable supply chain, their arrival is uncertain. Demand has slowed to an average of ~65 units/week in June. The OR backend subtracts the full 1300 units of pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation, effectively preventing any new orders. To bypass this and ensure the store has stock, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force the base stock level above the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 1600. This value is calculated to cover approximately 3 periods of demand (~240 units) plus an offset for the 1300 units of unusable pipeline inventory. This ensures that even after the backend subtracts the 1300 units, it will still place an order to cover current demand. sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a buffer for recently observed demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Discrepancy Total Failure: 1300 units in 'In-transit' are predominantly lost or unusable (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 = 670 confirmed lost; P19, P20 = 630 precarious). Explicit base_stock overrides are mandatory to overcome the backend's deduction of phantom inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 and the In-transit figure of 1600 units is composed entirely of 'phantom' inventory from lost or severely delayed orders. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 (totaling 670 units) are 8 to 21 periods overdue. Orders from P19 (280), P20 (350), and P21 (300) are also past their promised 2-period lead time, having not appeared in the Period 21 conclude message (implying a lead time of at least 3+ periods for these recent attempts). To force the OR backend to place an order despite this 1600-unit phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat (which acts as the base stock level) to be significantly higher than the current pipeline. Historical demand has trended downward from ~100 to ~50 units/week in June/July. Calculating a 3-week coverage (L=2 + 1 review period) at a safe demand of ~100 units/week suggests a required inventory of ~300. Adding the 1600 phantom units to this target yields 1900. I will set mu_hat to 1900 to ensure the backend generates a replenishment order of roughly 300 units (final order = base_stock - pipeline).

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Discrepancy Total Failure: 1600 units In-transit are all effectively lost or severely delayed (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 = 670 confirmed lost; P19, P20, P21 = 930 overdue/precarious). The OR backend is paralyzed by this phantom inventory. Explicit base_stock overrides are mandatory to force replenishment.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we finally saw a significant arrival: 350 units (ordered in P20, LT=2). This confirms that lead times are currently adhering to the promised 2-period window (P20 arrival in P22). However, our 'In-transit' count remains catastrophically high at 1550 units, while only the order from P21 (300 units) and the new order from P22 (300 units) are likely 'live'. This means approximately 950 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19) are effectively lost or phantom stock. The backend OR logic subtracts this 1550 in-transit from the target base stock, preventing normal orders unless we use 'explicit' overrides. Demand has significantly cooled in July, averaging 34 units/week over the last three weeks, down from the June/Spring average of ~70-80. To maintain stock while overcoming the 1550 units of phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory plus the desired safety stock. Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand + Z*Sigma. For Period 23, with L=2 and Demand~40, target should be ~200. To force the backend to order 300 units (to keep a buffer against future losses), I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1850 (1550 phantom + 300 new buffer).

Carry-over insight: Lead time stabilization confirmed in P22: P20 order arrived with LT=2. Demand regime shift: Significant drop in July to ~34 units/week (60% decrease from Spring). Total phantom inventory (confirmed lost/overdue) is 950 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-839.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation has fundamentally shifted. After periods of perceived lost stock and stockouts, multiple large orders from the 'emergency replenishment' phase (Periods 20, 21, and 22) have arrived, resulting in a current on-hand inventory of 878 units. The demand for this SKU ('Blouse in woven fabric') has significantly decreased in July, stabilizing at approximately 36 units per week (Period 21: 36, Period 22: 33, Period 23: 39), which aligns with late-summer seasonality for long-sleeve items. With 878 units on hand and a demand of ~36/week, we have over 24 weeks of supply, far exceeding any reasonable base stock level. The 'In-transit' figure of 950 still contains the 670 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 which are confirmed lost, plus the P19 order (280 units) which is now 5 periods overdue and likely lost. We must set parameters to ensure zero new orders are placed until this massive surplus is liquidated. Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods (P20 and P21 arrivals). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples to reflect the current low-demand regime, and the backend will naturally order 0 because on-hand >> base_stock.

Carry-over insight: Significant overstock established as of Period 23 (878 units on hand). Demand regime shift confirmed: July demand dropped to ~36 units/week (approx. 60-70% reduction from spring peak).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant downward shift in demand for SKU 697054003 (Womens Blouse) as we move into late July. Demand has dropped from a spring peak of ~100 units/week to a stable range of 33-39 units/week over the last four periods. Current on-hand inventory (840 units) is extremely high relative to this new demand regime, providing over 20 weeks of cover at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 950 units still includes a mix of confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 totaling 670 units) and the P19 order (280 units) which is now 5 periods overdue and likely lost as well. Given the severe overstock situation, no further orders are required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime (~36 units/week), which will result in the OR backend calculating a base stock much lower than current on-hand inventory, thus placing zero orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-768.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of severe overstock following the arrival of large orders (Periods 20, 21, 22) that were placed to compensate for phantom inventory. Current on-hand inventory is 804 units, while the demand regime has shifted significantly downward since July (averaging ~36 units/week). Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 1754 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 48 weeks of sales, far exceeding the remainder of the game. The goal is now to minimize holding costs while the existing stock is depleted. Despite high 'In-transit' figures (950 units, much of which is likely lost from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), the on-hand stock alone is sufficient to meet all upcoming demand. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to zero to prevent any additional orders being triggered by the OR backend, even if it eventually writes off the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Significant overstock established as of Period 23 (878 units on-hand). Consistent low-demand regime confirmed (Period 21-25): avg ~36 units/week (approx. 60-70% reduction from spring peak).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime for this SKU (Womens Blouse) has decelerated significantly from the spring peak (~114 units/week) to a summer average of approximately 39 units/week over the last 6 periods (P21-P26: 36, 33, 39, 38, 36, 53). The recent uptick to 53 is noted but does not yet establish a new trend. We are currently facing a massive overstock situation with 751 units on hand, which at current demand levels represents ~14-19 weeks of supply. Additionally, there are 950 units in-transit, although history suggests most are lost. Regardless of the lost units, on-hand inventory already far exceeds any reasonable base stock level (Base stock would be ~120-150 units even with high safety stock). Orders will naturally be capped at 0 by the OR backend. I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to represent the current low-demand summer regime (N=6), while keeping L at calculate to reflect the recent return to more normal 1-2 period lead times.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for SKU 697054003 is dominated by an extreme overstock. On-hand inventory is 691 units, while the recent 7-week demand average (Period 21-27) is only 42 units/week. This corresponds to over 16 weeks of supply on hand, far exceeding the coverage needed for a 2-period lead time. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 950 units consists entirely of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and potentially P19) that are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. Because the current on-hand inventory (691) is already vastly higher than any reasonable base stock level, no new orders should be placed. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (avg ~42, std ~11 from last 7 periods) to ensure the backend recognizes that the inventory position is excessive relative to current needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: August demand is showing a slight moderate increase (avg ~56) compared to the July low (avg ~36), but remains 50% lower than the spring peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand for this blouse has transitioned from its summer low (approx. 36 units/week in July) to a moderate upward trend in August (averaging 60 units over the last three weeks: 53, 60, 68). Despite this recovery, the on-hand inventory of 623 units is substantially higher than current demand levels (representing over 9 weeks of coverage). Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 950 units is composed entirely of phantom inventory from lost/overdue orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19). Given the massive overstock, the priority is to cease all ordering until inventory levels normalize. Setting L to 2 (promised) and using a recent demand window (recent_N=3 for mu_hat) ensures the base stock calculation reflects current moderate demand (~180 units base stock). Since the on-hand inventory (623) plus even a fraction of the 'live' pipeline far exceeds this base stock, the OR backend will correctly result in a zero order.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend in August: 3-week average increased to 60 units/week from July low of 36 (+67%).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of significant overstock (552 units on hand) with a demand that, while recovering in August (averaging ~63 units/week over the last 4 weeks), is still well below the spring peak. The 'In-transit' figure of 950 units is composed entirely of phantom inventory from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, and 19), which totals exactly 950 units (102+95+180+223+70+280). Because these units will never arrive, the OR backend incorrectly assumes a massive pipeline and will not order more. However, given the current on-hand inventory of 552 units against a demand of ~70 units/week, we have roughly 8 weeks of stock. Since the lead time has stabilized at 2 periods, we should continue to let the on-hand inventory deplete toward a more efficient level. I will use 'recent_5' for demand to capture the recent August recovery (mu_hat approx. 3 * 63 = 189), which is still far below the current on-hand inventory, ensuring the system correctly places no new orders while we burn off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend confirmed in August: Average demand has increased to ~63 units/week from the July low of ~36 (+75%). Total phantom inventory (confirmed lost/overdue) remains at 950 units.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has consistently recovered from the July low (~36 units/week) to an August/September average of approximately 68 units/week (last 5 periods: 53, 60, 68, 71, 90). The product (Womens Blouse) is entering the fall season, which typically sees higher demand than mid-summer. However, significant overstock remains (462 units on-hand), and there is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 950 units which are confirmed phantom/lost inventory (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 19). Because on-hand inventory (462) alone covers nearly 7 weeks of current demand (~68/week) and the OR backend would further subtract the 950 phantom units from any order calculation, no new orders should be placed yet. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current recovery regime (~68 units/week), allowing the on-hand inventory to drawdown naturally while maintaining a realistic base stock level. Lead time 'calculate' is used as recent deliveries (P20, P21, P22) showed stabilization at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime (Late Aug/Early Sept): Average demand increased to ~68 units/week from the July low of ~36 (+88%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-302.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a clear seasonal demand pattern. After a sharp decline in July (avg ~36), demand recovered throughout August and early September. The last four periods (P28-P31) show a stable recovery regime with an average demand of 77.25 units/week (68, 71, 90, 80). I will set mu_hat based on these last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this updated demand level. Regarding inventory, there is a significant 'phantom' pipeline of 950 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19) that are long overdue and confirmed lost or unusable. However, the current on-hand inventory is 382 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5 weeks of demand at the current rate (~77 units/week). Given a lead time of 2 periods, the total inventory needed to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods) is roughly 230-250 units. Since 382 units on-hand already exceeds this requirement, no new orders are necessary. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current recovery regime and allow the OR backend to realize that on-hand stock is sufficient, even when discounting the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime confirmed (Sept): Average demand for periods 28-31 is ~77 units/week, up from the July low of ~36.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Collection' blouse has stabilized in a recovery regime following the July low. Over the last five periods (P28-P32), demand has averaged 78.2 units per week (68, 71, 90, 80, 82), representing a clear shift from the previous 'low' regime of ~36. The 950 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory from lost shipments in P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and potentially P19 (all 6+ periods overdue). The backend uses these phantom units to calculate the order, but they will never arrive. However, with 300 units currently on hand, the inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 3.8 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and current period, the target base stock for a service level of 0.5 (where profit=holding cost) is approximately (1+2)*78 = 234 units. Since on-hand (300) > required base stock and we are trying to burn off the actual excess inventory while ignoring the 950 phantom units, I will set parameters to 'default' or 'recent_N' which will naturally result in zero orders until on-hand drops significantly further. This avoids over-ordering while the system still shows 300 real units.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Average demand for Sept (P28-P32) is ~78 units/week. 950 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost/phantom and will never arrive, but actual on-hand (300) is currently sufficient for short-term demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand jumped significantly to 137 units (from ~80 previous avg), likely representing a seasonal spike for fall blouses (September/October effect). On-hand inventory has dropped to 163. While the 'In-transit' figure remains at 950 (all of which are confirmed lost orders from P1-P14 and P19 that have never arrived), the OR backend will deduct these phantom units from any order calculation. To prevent a stockout, I must use 'explicit' parameters. I estimate demand at ~110 units/week to account for the recent spike, requiring a base stock that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand. 110 * 3 = 330. To get an order of ~160-170 units, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - phantom_inventory' results in the desired physical order. Since backend base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and phantom inventory is 950, I will set mu_hat to 1300 to force a replenishment order of approximately 187 units (1300 + safety - (163 on-hand + 950 phantom) \u2248 187).

Carry-over insight: September demand showed a final-week spike to 137 units, suggesting a potential shift to a higher demand regime (~110-130 range) for early fall.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the fall season (Oct/Nov/Dec) is showing early signs of recovery from the July low of ~36 units/week. Over the last five periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged approximately 91 units/week, though recent weeks transitioned from a spike of 137 to a lower 65. Given the product description (Women's Blouse, long sleeves), we anticipate sustained or increasing demand as cooler weather moves in. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture this new fall baseline (~91/week * (1+2) = 273). Regarding inventory: 'In-transit' shows 1137 units, but 950 of these are confirmed lost from much earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). The only 'live' replenishment is the 187 units ordered in Period 34. Subtracting the 950 phantom units from the total 1137 in-transit leaves 187 units actually in the pipeline. Current on-hand is 98. Combined real inventory is 285. To ensure the backend places necessary orders despite the phantom 950 units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1223 (calculated as the desired base stock of ~273 plus the 950 phantom units), effectively neutralizing the phantom inventory influence.

Carry-over insight: September/October demand regime: Average stabilized at ~91 units/week (P30-P34). Phantom inventory remains at 950 units (confirmed lost from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19), requiring explicit offsets in order parameters.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the SKU (a women's blouse) is in a fall demand regime. Demand has fluctuated recently: from a late-September peak of 137 units down to 65 and 54 units in the last two weeks. The trailing 4-week average is approximately 84 units/week. On-hand inventory is low at 44 units. The 'In-transit' total of 1137 units is severely inflated by 950 confirmed lost units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 19). The only 'live' order is P34 (187 units), which is expected to arrive during Period 36. To prevent a stockout while bypassing the OR backend's deduction of phantom inventory, I am setting an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to 285 to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 95 units/week), while sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent volatility. This explicit base stock (approx 365) minus the total in-transit (1137) would normally result in an order of 0; however, the explicit override is necessary to ensure the backend trigger remains responsive as on-hand depletes, though given the 1137 in-transit, no order will likely be placed unless I use a very high explicit value. Since P34 (187 units) is due now, on-hand should recover to ~200 shortly, making a massive order this period unnecessary.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) as of Period 37. Demand in October has softened significantly, averaging ~57 units over the last two periods (P35: 54, P36: 60), down from the September average (~90). A major systemic issue persists: the 'In-transit' figure of 1137 units is dominated by phantom/lost inventory. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19 (totaling 950 units) are confirmed lost based on carry-over history. The only 'live' order is 187 units from Period 34. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this phantom inventory, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values that incorporate a large offset. I am targeting a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (approx 200 units) PLUS the 950 phantom units, totaling ~1150 units. This forces the engine to recognize that the 1137 in-transit is insufficient to cover the phantom gap and current demand, triggering a replenishment order to regain stock for the late-October season.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime shift: Average demand decreased to ~57 units/week from Sept high of ~91. Phantom inventory (confirmed lost) remains at 950 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697054003' is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Recent demand in October has stabilized at approximately 63 units/week (average of P34-P37 demand: 65, 54, 60, 74). The 'In-transit' value of 1150 units is highly misleading as it includes 950 units from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P20 that are confirmed lost or severely overdue. Only the orders from P34 (187 units) and P37 (13 units) are 'live'. The backend's base_stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) will result in zero orders because the phantom 1150 units far exceed the required safety stock. To force the system to order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a targeted base_stock that accounts for the 950-unit phantom inventory. I assume a weekly demand of 65. With L=2, the total (L+1) demand is 195. To bypass the 950 phantom units and still place an order, the mu_hat (which effectively sets the base_stock before z*sigma) must be approximately 195 + 950 = 1145 units. This will trigger enough of an order to cover the current stockout and expected demand while the OR engine subtracts the 1150 in-transit. I will also use explicit sigma_hat to maintain safety stock levels around current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed current demand regime (Oct): ~63 units/week. Phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains at 950 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P20), requiring explicit parameter inflation for the OR engine to order.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1,137 units is significantly comprised of 'phantom' inventory (950 units confirmed lost from periods P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P20). The only viable order currently in transit is likely from P34 (187 units), which is now 5 periods overdue based on the P38 conclude message, suggesting further supply chain disruption or loss. Current demand has stabilized around 60-70 units/week following the late September peak. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1,137 phantom units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to a value that exceeds on-hand + pipeline. To cover 3 weeks of demand (~210 units) and offset the ~1137 phantom units, the effective base stock target needs to be approximately 1350. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to achieve this ordering behavior.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Supply chain instability continues; P34 order (187 units) is now 5 periods overdue. Total phantom/lost inventory in 'In-transit' now likely includes P34, totaling 1,137 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historical demand shows a mid-range stability around 60-70 units/week during October, but recent volatility is present. Pipeline inventory is extremely high at 1350 units, but based on carry-over history, 1137 of these units are confirmed lost or severely overdue (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P20, and likely P34). This phantom inventory's inclusion in the backend calculation prevents the OR engine from ordering since it believes there is enough stock coming. To reconcile, I must use 'explicit' values that bypass the phantom stock. I estimate the current demand regime at ~60 units/week with a lead time of 2. For a base stock level (target inventory for L+1 periods) at a 0.5 service level (Profit=Holding), the target should be (2+1)*60 = 180 units. However, to account for the backend subtracting the ~1350 'In-transit' units, I must set the mu_hat to a value that, when combined with pipeline, forces an order. With 0 on-hand and 1350 in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1600 and a high sigma to guarantee the order logic triggers replenishment to cover immediate demand while the backend's data set remains corrupted by phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Systematic In-transit Discrepancy Total Failure. 1137 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P20, P34) are confirmed lost/unusable. The OR backend subtracts these from its logic, requiring explicit 'mu_hat' inflation. Demand for Nov/late Oct is ~60 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive Systemic In-transit Discrepancy. Analysis of history confirms that 1,137 units in 'In-transit' are lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 19, 20, 34). Specifically, the Period 34 order (187 units) is now 6 periods overdue and clearly lost. The backend OR engine sees 1,600 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, leading it to believe no orders are necessary. However, the 'live' pipeline only consists of the orders from P39 (213) and P40 (250), totaling 463 units. Current demand has dropped to a lower regime (~35-40 units/week). My objective is to force the OR backend to order enough to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 120 units total) plus safety stock. Since the backend subtracts 1,600 from its target, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that, when 1,600 is subtracted, still triggers an order. To target an effective base stock of ~300 units (covering 3 weeks of demand plus buffer), I set mu_hat explicitly to 1900. This calculation (1900 - 1600 = 300) bypasses the phantom inventory obstacle.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Discrepancy expanded: Period 34 order (187 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, bringing total confirmed phantom inventory to 1,137 units. Current demand regime (Nov) has softened to ~36 units/week.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-165.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P39-P41) has dropped to an average of ~32 units/week, down from the October average of ~63. Based on the product description (Women's blouse) and the current date (late November), we are transitioning into the winter season, which likely explains this softening of demand for this particular item. Lead time appears stable at 2 periods (P39 order arrived in P41), but systemic inventory discrepancies remain a critical issue. The 'In-transit' count of 1687 contains approximately 1137 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P20, P34). The OR backend subtracts this entire 1687 from its target base stock, effectively paralyzing new orders. However, with 189 units on hand and a demand of ~32/week, we currently have roughly 6 weeks of stock. To prevent the OR backend from prematurely stopping orders while we burn through this safety stock, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a base stock that recognizes the 1137 phantom units. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-week window (L+1) at 32 units/week as 96 units, then add the 1137 phantom units to reach an operational mu_hat of ~1233. This ensures the backend doesn't see a 'surplus' and keeps the pipeline moving if demand recovers.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (Late Nov): Average demand decreased to ~32 units/week from the October average of ~60. Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 1137 units, distorting the In-transit balance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a systemic 'phantom inventory' issue: 1,137 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 19, 20, 34) are confirmed lost or unusable as they are 7+ periods overdue. The current In-transit balance of 1,687 includes these 1,137 units plus recent orders from P40 (250) and P41 (300). The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1,687) from its target stock level, which would naturally result in zero orders despite on-hand inventory being only 52. Demand recently spiked to 137 in Period 42, likely reflecting early December/holiday shopping for this 'Everyday Blouse'. To force the backend to place an order and maintain service levels, I must inflate 'mu_hat' to exceed the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a target stock level that offsets the 1,137 phantom units plus covers projected holiday demand (~100 units/week) over the lead time and review period (L+1 = 3). Target stock = Phantom (1,137) + Demand (3 * 100) = 1,437. Since mu_hat is used as the base stock level, setting it to 1,440 ensures a replenishment order is triggered.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike to 137 (P42) confirms holiday seasonality for the blouse. Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 1,137 units, requiring explicit overrides to bypass OR backend logic.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the December holiday season (Dec 9th). Recent demand (Period 42: 137, Period 43: 74) shows a clear spike relative to the November average of ~32, confirming holiday seasonality for this blouse. We currently have 528 units on hand. The 'In-transit' balance of 1137 units is composed of confirmed lost/phantom orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 19, 20, and 34. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' amount from its base_stock calculation, it will not place any new orders unless its target inventory exceeds 1137 + on-hand (528). With approximately 4 periods remaining in the simulation, our goal is to maintain stock through the holiday peak while avoiding further over-ordering given the significant existing on-hand inventory. At current holiday demand levels (~100 units/week), 528 units are sufficient for the remainder of the game. We will use explicit parameters to prevent further ordering while the phantom inventory persists.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed (Period 42-43): Demand increased to ~105 units/week avg for early Dec from Nov avg of ~32. Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 1,137 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in the mid-December holiday period for the blouse SKU. Demand in Period 42-43 showed a spike (avg 105), while Period 44 dropped significantly to 26. This indicates high volatility due to holiday timing. On-hand inventory is healthy at 502 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 1137 units is composed of confirmed lost/phantom orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P20, P34), which the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from its base stock calculation. However, since the current on-hand inventory (502) is very high relative to the recent demand mean (~60-70 units) and we are approaching the end of the game (Period 47), no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from ordering despite the phantom inventory subtraction, I will keep L at default and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (approx. last 5 periods including the spike and the recent drop).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019. We are in the final stages of the holiday shopping season. Demand has been volatile: P42=137, P43=74, P44=26, P45=75. Average demand over the last 4 periods is ~78 units/week. On-hand inventory is 427 units, which is sufficient for approximately 5 weeks given current demand levels. There is a documented systemic issue with 'In-transit' inventory: 1,137 units (from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 19, 20, 34) are confirmed lost or severely overdue and will not arrive. These 'phantom' units mislead the OR backend's logic (base_stock - pipeline), causing it to under-order. To mitigate this, I continue to use explicit 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to inflate the base stock target, effectively ignoring the phantom pipeline. Considering the holiday peak is likely passing and we have 427 units on-hand, I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) at a slightly conservative rate of 80 units/week to maintain safety stock without over-ordering as we move into January.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are exiting the holiday peak. The current on-hand inventory is 374 units. Historical demand shows a significant post-holiday drop-off (observed in previous months after peaks). In Period 46, demand was 53. The 'In-transit' balance of 1137 contains 1137 units confirmed as 'phantom' inventory (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P20, and P34), which are chronically overdue and will not arrive. This phantom inventory misleads the OR backend into thinking we are over-supplied, though in this specific case, the actual on-hand inventory (374) is already quite high for the projected post-holiday demand (~30-50 units/week). No new order is needed. I will set parameters to reflect the current post-holiday demand regime (~45 units/week) while providing a high mu_hat to ensure the backend doesn't order further given the massive phantom pipeline and sufficient current stock.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand deceleration: Early Jan demand historically aligns with lower regimes (approx 30-50 units). Phantom inventory remains stagnant at 1137 units.
