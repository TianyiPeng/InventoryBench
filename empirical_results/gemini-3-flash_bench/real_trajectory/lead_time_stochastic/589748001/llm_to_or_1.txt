Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 589748001. The product is a Bella waistbelt (Women's accessories). We have 5 historical demand samples (97, 79, 82, 148, 102) with a mean of 101.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 27.6. Since this is the first period of decision-making, there are no prior conclusions about lead time drift or lost shipments. The promised lead time is 2. The OR backend will use the provided parameters to set a base stock level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (the full sample set) for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent behavior, while keeping the promised lead time as the estimate for L. This setup ensures we cover demand for L+1 periods (3 periods), aiming for a roughly 50% service level given the Profit/Holding cost ratio of 1.0/1.0.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is a women's waist belt. Historical demand samples (recent 5 weeks) are: 97, 79, 82, 148, 102. Demand in Period 1 was 54. Total mean across these 6 points is approx 93.7. The promised lead time is 2 periods. An order of 148 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit; per the lead time definition, it is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand is 0, meaning we lost 54 units of demand in Period 1. To manage the pipeline, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the recent demand mean (~94) and standard deviation (~31). For L, I will stay with 'default' (promised lead time 2) as there is no evidence yet of a deviation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 281 units in transit (148 units ordered in P1, 133 units ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order should arrive during the Period 3 arrival resolution phase, making it visible in the P3 conclude message. Therefore, it is normal that we see 0 arrived units in the P1 and P2 conclude messages. However, since on-hand is 0, we have lost sales in P1 and P2 (demand was 54 and 45). Historical demand data shows a range of 79 to 148, but recent demand in P1 and P2 was lower (54, 45). Given the product description (Wide waist belt) and the current date (late February), there isn't a strong seasonal signal for a spike, but we need to maintain stock. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 (all 5 history points + P1 and P2) to capture the overall mean (~87 per period), which at L=2 implies a mu_hat around (1+2)*87 = 261. I will set L to default (2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is a women's waist belt. Historical demand samples (late Jan/early Feb) averaged ~102 units, but actual demand in the last three periods (Feb 11 - Feb 25) has dropped significantly (54, 45, 35), likely due to post-holiday settling or seasonal shifts in accessories. The promised lead time is 2 periods. No units have arrived yet. The order from Period 1 (148 units) is expected to arrive DURING Period 3 (visible in P4 conclude) or DURING Period 4 (visible in P5 conclude) depending on standard 2-period logic. Since P3 conclude (the most recent report) shows arrived=0, and P1's order was placed in P1, we expect it to arrive now in Period 4. There are 281 units in transit (148 from P1 and 133 from P2). mu_hat and sigma_hat are adjusted using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand regime and prevent excessive overstocking when inventory finally arrives, as holding costs ($1) equal the profit margin ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Feb 11: average demand decreased from ~100 to ~45 units/week (-55%).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a Bella waistbelt. Historical demand for the first 5 samples was high (mean ~102), but the game history shows a significant drop since Period 1 (averaging ~37 units over the last 4 periods). Specifically, the last sample was only 14 units. The Carry-over Insight already flagged a -55% drop. I need to adapt to this lower demand regime. Lead time: The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (actual L=2), matching the promised L. The order from Period 1 (148 units) is still in-transit and overdue (ordered Period 1, promised L=2, should have arrived in Period 3). Since it didn't arrive by Period 4 conclude, it might be lost, but 'In-transit' still shows 148. Current on-hand is 119. Given the low recent demand (mean ~37), the 119 on-hand + potential 148 in-transit is more than sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the lower demand mean (~37) and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time matches promised.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is a women's waist belt. Historical demand since Period 1 shows a significant drop-off: initial weeks saw demand in the 100s (pre-game data), but actual demand in Periods 4 and 5 dropped to 14 and 11 respectively, suggesting a post-season or post-trend decline. The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~45, but the last two periods suggest an even deeper decline. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). We have 108 units on-hand and 148 in-transit (ordered Period 1), which is over 250 units against a current demand of ~15 units/week. Holding cost equals profit ($1.0), so we must avoid overstocking. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent low demand regime using recent_N=3 (Periods 3, 4, 5: 35, 14, 11) to avoid triggering further large orders while we burn through existing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower levels: Periods 4-5 average demand is <15 units/week, significantly lower than the ~45 estimated in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), our inventory for the 'Bella waistbelt' is 71 on-hand plus 148 in-transit (ordered Period 1, promised lead time 2). This P1 order is now 6 periods since ordering and remains un-concluded, suggesting it is either significantly delayed or lost. Even if lost, current inventory (71) is sufficient given the recent demand regime shift. Demand has dropped dramatically: the pre-start average was ~101, but recent observations (Periods 4-6) averages ~21 units/week. Period 6 saw a slight uptick to 37, but the overall trend remains much lower than the initial historical data. Because the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the lower post-shift mean while giving some weight to the P6 increase, and L to explicit=2 to reset expectations based on the promised lead time and avoid over-ordering due to the delayed P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Order from Period 1 (148 units) is still missing after 6 periods (promised 2), likely lost or severely delayed. Recent 4-week demand average is ~24 units, confirming a sustained lower regime compared to early 2019 samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The current demand regime (since Period 1) averaged 30 units/week (54, 45, 35, 14, 11, 37, 13), much lower than the early Jan samples and the initial 148 order. This reflects the product (Bella waistbelt) stabilizing after an initial burst. Shipment status: The Period 1 order (148 units) is clearly lost (7 periods elapsed, promised 2). The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time in Period 4 (lead_time=2). Current inventory is 58 on-hand. With demand around 30, we have ~2 weeks of supply. My goal is to prevent the OR backend from seeing the lost 148 units as 'in-transit' which would block new orders. However, I have enough on-hand for now. I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the 30-unit mean and adjust lead time to explicit=2 to mirror actual observed performance and ignore the ghost 'in-transit' units from Period 1.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods based on Period 2 shipment arrival. Period 1 shipment (148 units) is confirmed lost/void after 7 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/04/08), the product (women's wide waist belt) is in a significantly lower demand regime compared to the initial samples. The average demand across the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8) is 17 units, ranging from 10 to 37. The 'In-transit' of 148 units corresponds to the Period 1 order, which is now 8 periods old (promised 2) and is explicitly flagged in carry-over insights as lost/void; however, the OR backend's 'In-transit' accounting likely still includes it. My parameter choice for L will remain at the promised 'default' (2) because the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (2 periods). I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the stable low-demand regime (avg ~17) observed since early March, ignoring the lost Period 1 units to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to phantom pipeline inventory. With profit=1 and holding=1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the target base stock is the median demand over (L+1) periods. Current on-hand (48) is sufficient for nearly 3 periods of the new demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019-04-15). The product is a women's waist belt. Historical data from early 2019 showed demand levels around 80-140, but since Period 1 (Feb 11), demand has shifted significantly lower. Specifically, for the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9), demand has been 11, 37, 13, 10, and 5, averaging ~15.2 units per week. The order from Period 1 (148 units) is confirmed lost as it has been 9 periods since it was placed (promised lead time 2). The 'In-transit' figure of 148 reflects this lost shipment. On-hand inventory is 43 units. With the current low demand regime, 43 units cover nearly 3 weeks of demand, well within the safety stock requirements for a 2-period lead time. I will set L to the promised 2 periods (using 'default'). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture only the current low-demand regime (Periods 5-9) and ignore the much higher pre-February and early-February samples which are no longer representative. This transition to a lower base stock will prevent over-ordering while maintaining adequate service levels for the actual current demand levels.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), the 'Bella waistbelt' continues in a low-demand regime. Since the demand shift detected around Period 4, demand has averaged approximately 18 units per week (Periods 4-10). The current on-hand inventory is 20 units. Crucially, the 'In-transit' quantity of 148 units is the missing shipment from Period 1. Historical 'conclude' messages confirm that Period 2's shipment arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2), while Period 1's shipment is now 10 periods old and effectively lost. The OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation likely includes these 148 lost units, which would suppress new orders even as on-hand stock depletes. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the low-demand regime since P4) to reflect the current mean of ~18. For L, I use 'default' (2) as evidence from Period 2 confirms it is stable. I use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the recent lowered volatility. This setup ensures the Base Stock protects against the ~18 units/week demand while the carry-over insights track the lost shipment issue.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Wide waist belt) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Period 11 demand was 36 units, but only 20 could be sold. The total in-transit quantity of 148 reflects the Period 1 order, which has been confirmed lost (per Period 8 carry-over insight). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'Base Stock' to determine order quantity, this ghost inventory must be bypassed. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to set a high enough target stock level that forces an order despite the 148 ghost units. Data analysis: Recent 8-week demand (Periods 4-11) average is ~20 units/period (14, 11, 37, 13, 10, 5, 23, 36). Standard deviation for this period is ~12. With a lead time L=2, the total lead-time plus review period is 3 periods. I target a base stock of approximately 100 units (expected demand of 3*20=60 plus 40 units safety stock) to clear the 148-unit pipeline deduction and trigger a new shipment of roughly 50-100 units.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred Period 11 due to ghost inventory (lost P1 order) blocking replenishment; forcing order via explicit parameters.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13 (2019/5/6). The SKU (Bella waistbelt) is currently stocked out on-hand (0 units) with 250 units in transit following orders placed to recover from the P11 stockout caused by the lost P1 shipment. The historical demand has stabilized into a lower regime. Calculations for the last 9 periods (P4-P12) show a mean demand of approximately 21.3 units/week with a standard deviation of 14.1. Using the base stock logic with L=2, mu_hat should target a 3-period window (L+1). mu_hat = 3 * 21.3 = 63.9. sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 14.1 = 24.4. Since there are 250 units in transit (which is significantly more than 64), the OR backend's capped policy [order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] will naturally result in zero additional orders until the pipeline clears. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime while excluding the high-demand P1-P3 period and early Jan samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 Context: We are currently in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The Period 1 shipment (148 units) is confirmed lost, and it was causing 'ghost inventory' in the OR backend's calculation. I placed an manual order of 102 units in Period 12 using explicit parameters to bypass this. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, the Period 12 order is expected to arrive DURING Period 14 (this period). However, because arrivals occur after the decision phase, this will only be visible in the Period 14 conclusion. The current 'In-transit' of 250 units includes the lost 148 units and the genuine 102 units. Demand has remained relatively stable in a lower regime; the average demand since Period 4 (when the shift stabilized) is approx 22 units/week. I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach to capture this regime while the backend waits for the Period 12 shipment to clear the stockout. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as we have confirmed historical arrivals within 2 periods.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The Period 12 order of 102 units arrived in Period 14 (lead time = 2), leaving 66 units on-hand. The Period 1 order of 148 units is still listed in 'In-transit' but is confirmed lost (ordered Feb 11, now May 20), creating 'ghost inventory' that prevents the OR backend from ordering enough. Demand since Period 1 has shifted to a lower regime compared to the initial samples. Over the last 10 periods (P5-P14), the average demand is (11+37+13+10+5+23+36+43+34+36)/10 = 24.8 units/week. To ensure the backend ignores the lost 148 units and maintain a base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~25 units/week, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 225 (3 * 75) to force an order that compensates for the pipeline inventory mismatch and accounts for variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27th, 2019. We are in Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand history: Period 15 saw a massive spike to 105 units, likely due to a late spring/early summer seasonal effect for fashion accessories like the 'Bella waistbelt' or a specific promotional event. Previous periods (12-14) averaged around 38 units. The spike in P15 caused a stockout (on-hand is 0). We have 159 units in-transit: 148 from the lost P1 order (which the OR engine still sees in pipeline inventory), and a small order of 11 from P15. Because the OR engine counts that lost P1 order against our base stock, it will under-order unless we set \u03bc\u0302 high enough to overcome the 'ghost' inventory of 148 units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure we order enough to cover the recent demand spike and maintain availability, targeting a base stock that accounts for the 148 lost units not arriving.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand spike detected: Period 15 demand (105) is ~3x the previous 4-week average (36).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a demand spike regime, with demand for Period 15 (105) and Period 16 (93) significantly higher than the previous average of ~36. The product is a women's waist belt; such items often see demand shifts early in the summer season (June). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory consists of 300 units: P15 (11 units, arriving P17), P16 (141 units, arriving P18), and the 'lost' P1 order (148 units). I must exclude the ghost inventory of 148 units from the safety stock calculation to ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order if necessary, however, even at a high mu_hat (e.g. 100 units * (2+1) = 300), the 300 units in transit (including ghosts) might block auto-ordering. I will set the mu_hat to 300 (100 units/period * 3) and use recent_N for sigma to capture the new high volatility, while using explicit L=2 to reflect the reliable recent arrivals from P12.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained: Periods 15-16 average demand is 99 units, a ~2.75x increase from the previous baseline. Ghost inventory (P1 order: 148 units) continues to distort the lead-time pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-96.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the product (Bella waistbelt) is in a volatile demand period. After a significant two-week spike (Periods 15-16, average ~99), demand dropped sharply in Period 17 back to 28 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 148 units is the ghost inventory from Period 1 that never arrived and is blocking the OR engine's replenishment logic because it assumes this inventory is coming. Since on-hand inventory is currently healthy (124 units), no immediate order is needed to cover the immediate term. To prevent the 'ghost inventory' from causing future stockouts, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to set a target level that ignores the corrupted pipeline calculation. The recent 3-week average demand (105, 93, 28) is ~75. With a lead time of 2, I need to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 225 units). However, because on-hand is already 124, and the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' (148) from the target, setting mu_hat explicitly to a high value like 350-400 would be required to trigger an order if needed. Given current on-hand of 124 and the drop in demand to 28, I will wait one period to see if demand stabilizes low or high before forcing more stock. I set L=default (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 3 periods to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a 2-week spike (avg 99), demand dropped to 28 in Period 17, suggesting the spike was transient. Ghost inventory (148 units) remains in pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (2019/6/17), the current on-hand inventory is 107 units. The 148 units ordered in Period 1 remain 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost; this 'ghost inventory' incorrectly inflates the backend's pipeline calculations, preventing necessary orders. Demand has returned to lower levels (avg 22.5 units over the last two weeks) after a transient two-week spike in late May. To manage the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=5) to capture the recent high volatility and mean (avg ~55 units), while using an explicit L=2 to reflect the promised lead time. This combination will result in a base_stock target (~165 units) that is slightly above the ghost inventory (148), allowing for a small safety order if needed, while primarily using the current on-hand stock to cover demand until the lost shipment logic can be bypassed or corrected.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20 (June 24). The inventory status reflects 74 units on hand, but the 'In-transit' figure of 148 represents the Period 1 order that was confirmed lost in Period 8. This 'ghost inventory' still incorrectly bloats the pipeline inventory count used by the OR backend. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to a value that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand plus the 148 phantom units. Current demand has stabilized after the mid-May/June spike (P15-P16 avg: 99; P17-P19 avg: 26). The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~26. For a lead time of 2, (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand is 3 * 26 = 78 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 148 ghost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 78 + 148 = 226. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in recent weeks without keeping it at the extreme spike levels.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. The 'Bella waistbelt' is currently in a post-spike period with demand stabilizing between 17-33 units over the last 4 weeks (Avg ~27). The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' of 148 units from Period 1 that never arrived (confirmed lost in Period 8) but still sits in the OR backend's 'In-transit' accounting. Currently, On-hand is 46 and In-transit is 152 (148 'ghost' + 4 from P20). If I use the default backend logic, it will see Pipeline Inventory = 46+152 = 198 units, which vastly exceeds the base stock for a (2+1) period demand window (estimated at ~90-100 units), resulting in zero orders being placed despite needing actual replenishment. To bypass this, I use 'explicit' methods. For mu_hat, I set the (1+L) period demand (3 periods: current + 2 lead time) based on the recent average of ~33 units/week (3 * 33 = 99). For sigma_hat, I use a value of 25 (approx sqrt(3) * 15) to account for recent volatility observed in May/June. Lead time L is set to 2 as confirmed by the arrival of shipments from P12, P15, and P16.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent history reveals two critical issues: 1) The 'ghost inventory' from the lost Period 1 shipment (148 units) still populates the OR backend's pipeline, preventing automated orders because it believes replenishment is coming. 2) Demand has become highly volatile; while the baseline was around 30, Period 21 saw a spike to 76, leading to a stockout. The promised lead time is 2, and recent arrivals (Periods 14, 17) confirm the actual lead time is stable at 2 periods (except for one fluke 1-period arrival). I must calculate mu_hat to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (Review=1), totaling 3 periods of demand. Using the last 5 periods (mean=36.4), the requirement is ~109 units. However, because the backend sees 152 units in transit (148 'ghost' + 4 from P20), a standard order will not trigger. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it high enough to overcome the ghost inventory 'pipeline' and ensure a replenishment order is generated to recover from the stockout. I've set mu_hat to 260 to effectively bypass the ghost 148 units and target a base stock sufficient for the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Persistent stockout confirmed in Period 21 due to ghost inventory (148 units from Period 1) blocking automated replenishment. Demand continues to exhibit high volatility (spikes to 76 in P21 vs baseline of ~30).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Period 22 demand was 83, confirming a high-demand regime or significant volatility (last two weeks average: 79.5). The 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (148 units) is still in the 'In-transit' total of 256. This ghost inventory plus the Period 22 order (108 units) equals the 256 units shown in transit. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (including the 148 ghost units) from the base stock, it will under-order or fail to order entirely. To bypass this, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. I estimate demand for the (L+1) = 3 period window using the recent high-demand average of ~80 units/period (80 * 3 = 240). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 148 ghost units, the base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) must exceed 256 units. I will set mu_hat to 350 to force a replenishment order that covers immediate needs while accounting for the 'In-transit' distortion.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Ghost inventory from Period 1 (148 units) continues to block the automated pipeline calculation. Demand has shifted higher in July (Periods 21-22 average: 79.5 vs June average: ~25).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime in July (Periods 21-23 average: 74 units/week), significantly above the Q2 average. On-hand inventory is 45 units. The primary issue is the 'ghost inventory' of 148 units from Period 1 that remains in the 'In-transit' pipeline but will never arrive. This artificially inflates the backend's view of inventory (Total pipeline = 242, which includes 148 lost units and 94 units from P23). To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1=3). Given the recent trend, a weekly mean of 75 results in a mu_hat of 225. This ensures the OR engine places a meaningful order now to stay ahead of the July spike despite the ghost inventory blocking the capped policy.

Carry-over insight: July demand spike confirmed: Periods 21-23 average demand is 74 units/week, a ~150% increase from the June baseline (~29 units/week). Ghost inventory (P1 order: 148 units) still requires manual parameter overrides.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '589748001' (Womens Belt) is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime in July (Periods 21-24: 76, 83, 63, 76), averaging 74.5 units per week, which is significantly higher than the previous June baseline (~29 units). The inventory is currently 0 on-hand, and a stockout occurred in Period 24. A 'ghost inventory' shipment of 148 units from Period 1 is still erroneously counted by the OR backend as 'In-transit', preventing the automated system from ordering sufficient stock. The total actual pipeline consists of 94 units (ordered P23, expected arrival P25). I will use 'explicit' parameters to bypass the ghost inventory distortion. Setting mu_hat to 225 covers (1+L=3) periods of demand at the current average (75 * 3). Keeping L at 2 based on recent history.

Carry-over insight: July demand regime confirmed at ~75 units/week across 4 consecutive periods (P21-P24), representing a ~150% increase from June (~29). Lead times consistently range 1-2 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (August 5), the on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 242 units contains 148 ghost units from Period 1 (confirmed lost) and a 94-unit order placed in Period 23. This Period 23 order should arrive during Period 26 (L=2-3). Since 'In-transit' (242) is much higher than actual physical stock (94), the OR backend will potentially calculate an order size of 0 if using default parameters. To bypass this, I use 'explicit' methods. Demand for the last 4 periods (P22-P25) has averaged 68.25 units/week. I set mu_hat based on this current higher regime (L+1 = 3 periods) at 205 (approx 3 * 68) and a higher sigma_hat (80) to handle the significant volatility and ensure a buffer against current stockouts. This forces the engine to recognize a higher base stock requirement despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: August demand baseline confirmed at ~68 units/week (Periods 22-25 avg). Ghost inventory (148 units) still requires manual intervention to ensure ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 observation shows on-hand inventory is 33 units. The 'In-transit' of 148 units is the ghost shipment from Period 1 that will never arrive. Because the backend calculates orders as (base_stock - on-hand - in-transit), these 148 units block any automated orders. I must use 'explicit' parameters to force an order. Demand Analysis: August demand has stabilized at ~65 units/week (P23-P26 average: 62.75). Lead times are volatile (1 to 3 periods), so I will use L=2 as a conservative estimate. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to exceed (on-hand + ghost in-transit). Target inventory (base_stock) should cover L+1 periods (3 weeks) of demand at ~65/week plus safety stock. 3 * 65 = 195 units. To overcome the 148 ghost units + 33 on-hand = 181 units already perceived by the backend, I will set mu_hat to 300 to trigger an order of approximately 120 units, keeping the pipeline moving through the August sustained demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P23 order arrived P26 (L=3), while P22 order arrived P23 (L=1). Demand remains stable in the 60-70 range for 4 consecutive periods (P23-P26 avg 63).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is out of stock (on-hand: 0) as of the end of Period 27. There is 267 units in-transit, but this includes the 'ghost' shipment of 148 units from Period 1 that is confirmed lost. Actual viable pipeline is 119 units (ordered Period 27). Current demand is stable in a higher regime (Periods 23-27 average: 63 units/week). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods of demand (roughly 189 units). Because the 'ghost' inventory of 148 units prevents the OR backend from triggering orders (it thinks total inventory is 119 + 148 = 267), I must use explicit parameters to force a replenishment order that covers the current stockout and expected demand until the Period 27 order arrives. Setting mu_hat to 350 ensures the base stock (approx 350) minus the distorted pipeline (267) results in an order of ~83 units, which provides a safety buffer for the current stockout.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 86 in Period 28. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime for August, with the last 6 periods (P23-P28) averaging 66.8 units/week. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P22=1, P20=2, P23=3). A significant 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (148 units) is still in-transit and blocks the automated OR replenishment logic, which sees 350 units in-transit (148 ghost + 119 from P27 + 83 from P28). To maintain stock for the next 3 weeks (L+1), we need approximately 200-240 units. Since current real in-transit is 202 (119 + 83), and we are at zero on-hand, we must use explicit parameters to force an order that accounts for both the ghost inventory distortion and the sustained high demand. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approx 215 * 3) to ensure a baseline order is generated despite the ghost units.

Carry-over insight: August demand regime confirmed stable at ~67 units/week (P23-P28 avg). Ghost inventory (148 units) requires explicit parameter management to prevent replenishment blockage.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 is currently in a state of stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. The ghost inventory of 148 units (from a lost Period 1 order) continues to inflate the pipeline inventory, which would normally lead the OR engine to under-order. Therefore, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force sufficient replenishment. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime; the average demand from Period 23 to Period 29 is approximately 70.5 units/week. Given the current date (September 2), we are entering the fall season, which generally favors accessory sales like belts. I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of 75 units/week over a 3-period window (Review + Lead Time = 1+2=3), totaling 225. I am setting sigma_hat to 50 to account for recent volatility (demand swings between 51 and 86). Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with the promised and most frequent actual lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since early July (Period 21). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 78.4 units/week. September often sees continued demand for accessories as the season transitions. The 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (148 units) still exists in the in-transit field (Total in-transit 385 = P1: 148 + P29: 237). This stale P1 entry continues to block the OR engine's base-stock calculation. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a target base stock that ignores the 148-unit distortion. I am targeting a base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods. With a mean of ~80 and an estimated sigma of ~15, a base stock of 300 (covering roughly 3.75 weeks of demand) is appropriate to maintain availability while accounting for the large P29 order already in transit (237 units) and current on-hand (104). The OR engine will subtract (P1:148 + P29:237) from the base stock; by setting mu_hat high enough, we ensure the system doesn't under-order due to the P1 ghost units.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed at ~80 units/week (P26-P30 avg: 78.4). Inventory distortion from Period 1 (148 units) remains the primary driver for manual parameter overrides.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status: Period 32 (Sept 16, 2019). On-hand: 30, In-transit: 385 (includes 148 units 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 and a large order of 237 from Period 29). The Period 29 order (237 units) is expected to arrive during Period 32 (L=3), which will replenish the stock. Current demand regime (Sept) is approximately 80 units/week (P26-P31 average: 77.7). Because the ghost inventory (148 units) still populates the OR backend's pipeline, a standard base-stock calculation (Expected Lead Time Demand - Pipeline) would result in a zero order. To ensure sufficient coverage, I am using explicit parameters. Given L=2 (promised) or L=3 (recent), I need to cover 3-4 periods of demand. With demand at ~80, a base stock of ~300-340 is ideal. However, since the OR engine subtracts Pipeline (In-transit + On-hand = 385 + 30 = 415), setting mu_hat explicitly high compensates for the 148-unit ghost inventory distortion. I set mu_hat = 400 and sigma_hat = 60 to maintain a high service level while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) as of the start of Period 33, following a stockout in Period 32. In-transit inventory is 385 units, composed of: P1 ghost order (148 units, confirmed lost), P29 order (237 units, expected L=2-3). Since the P29 order was placed 4 periods ago and has not arrived, lead time for this specific shipment is \u2265 4 periods. September demand has demonstrated a higher, stable regime: P30 (98), P31 (74), P32 (75), averaging ~82 units/week. Given the current stockout and the fact that 148 units in the 'pipeline' are actually non-existent, I must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger an order despite the backend's perception of 385 units in transit. Total pipeline requirement for L=3 is (1+3)*82 = 328 units. Current perceived pipeline is 148 (ghost) + 237 (real) = 385. To force a safety order and account for the higher demand volatility, I will set an explicit mu_hat covering the estimated real demand plus a buffer to overcome the 148-unit ghost inventory blockage.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility increased: Order P29 is still missing at P33 (L>=4), suggesting a possible lead time extension beyond the previous L=3 max. September demand intensified to ~82 units/week average (P30-P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime, with demand in Period 33 reaching 142 units, a significant spike compared to the September average of ~80. The 4-week moving average (P30-P33) is now 97.25 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline contains 520 units, but 148 of these are 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 that will never arrive. Additionally, the order from Period 29 (237 units) is now 5 periods old (L=5+), which is significantly longer than the promised 2 or the recently observed 3, suggesting extreme lead-time volatility or another lost shipment. To prevent the OR backend from being blocked by the 148 ghost units and the potentially lost 237 units from P29, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will forecast demand at approximately 100 units/week for the next 4 periods (L+1, where L is estimated at 3 given recent delays). mu_hat = (1+3) * 100 = 400. sigma_hat is set to cover the high volatility observed (std of recent periods is ~30).

Carry-over insight: September/October demand surge confirmed: Period 33 demand (142) represents a 75% increase over the previous 4-week average. Lead time volatility has worsened, with Period 29 order (237 units) still missing after 5 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 35 (early October). The 'Bella waistbelt' is experiencing a significant Q4 demand surge with September demand averaging ~93 units/week (P30-P34). The most recent demand (P33: 142, P34: 83) confirms high volatility and growth compared to the August average (~67). Crucially, we are facing a supply chain disruption: the order from Period 29 (237 units) is now 6 periods late (L=6) and must be considered lost or severely delayed. This loss, combined with the stockout since Period 32, means we have zero on-hand inventory. The total 'In-transit' of 520 units includes the lost P29 (237 units) and P1 (148 units) orders, totaling 385 'ghost' units that block automated replenishment. Subtracting ghost units, the actual reliable pipeline is only 135 units (from P33). To cover the surge demand (forecasted at 110/week) across a likely extended lead time (L=3), we require a total coverage of (3+1)*110 = 440 units. Since 440 - 135 = 305, I will use explicit parameters to force an order of approximately this size and override the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Order from Period 29 (237 units) confirmed lost/severely delayed after 6 periods (promised 2). Combined with Period 1 (148 units), total ghost inventory is 385 units. Demand baseline for Oct/Nov adjusted to ~110 units/week to reflect seasonal surge and recent volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 36 (mid-October). The SKU '589748001' (Womens wide waist belt) is entering its peak seasonal period (Q4/Holiday). Recent demand has surged, with an average of approximately 93 units/week over the last 6 weeks (P30-P35), including a peak of 142. The pipeline is currently heavily distorted by two likely lost orders: Period 1 (148 units) and Period 29 (237 units), totaling 385 'ghost' units. Total In-transit is 520, meaning only 135 units (from Period 33) are truly expected to arrive. On-hand is 0, leading to a persistent stockout. To bypass the OR engine's reliance on ghost inventory and to account for the seasonal demand increase, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate a forward-looking weekly demand of 110 units. With an adjusted lead time of 3 periods (reflecting recent delays), the base stock needs to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand plus a safety buffer. I set mu_hat at 440 (110 * 4) and sigma_hat at 120 (approx 60% of mean) to handle the high volatility seen in early Q4.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Continued stockout due to ghost inventory (385 units total: P1=148, P29=237) and seasonal demand surge. Oct/Nov baseline demand is now estimated at 110 units/week based on the P30-P35 average (93) and the high volatility of early Q4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing a persistent inventory distortion caused by 385 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 1: 148 units, Period 29: 237 units) that are confirmed lost or severely delayed but remain in the 'in-transit' pipeline. This distortion blocks the OR backend's automated replenishment, necessitating an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat strategy to force orders. Current on-hand is 51 units. Demand in Sept/Oct has surged, averaging ~93 units/week (P30-P36). Using a baseline forecast of 110 units/week to account for this seasonal surge and volatility, the (L+1) demand requirement is approximately 440 units (for L=3). To trigger a replenishment that bypasses the 385 units already in-transit, I set mu_hat explicitly to 550, which targets a total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) above the ghost count. I set L to 3 to reflect the most recently observed lead time from Period 36, and use an explicit sigma_hat of 120 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the high volatility observed in Q4.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed lead time remains volatile, trending towards L=3 (observed Period 36). Ghost inventory (385 total: P1=148, P29=237) continues to require explicit mu_hat overrides to ensure replenishment orders are calculated above the false pipeline total.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stockout state (on-hand 0). We are contending with a significant 'ghost inventory' issue totaling 385 units (P1: 148 units, P29: 237 units) which the OR backend perceives as in-transit, thereby blocking automated replenishment. Period 37 demand was 108, and the average demand over the last four active periods (P30-P31, P36-P37) is approximately 91 units. Lead times have settled at L=3 (confirmed by P33 order arriving in P36). To overcome the 385 units of ghost inventory and trigger a replenishment that covers the next 4 periods (L+1) at a forecasted 110 units/week (accounting for seasonal October/November surge and stockout recovery), mu_hat must be set to exceed (110 * 4) + 385 = 825. I will set mu_hat to 850 and L to 3 to ensure the OR engine recognizes a deficit despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Ghost inventory remains at 385 units (Period 1: 148, Period 29: 237). Lead time is stabilizing at 3 periods. Seasonal baseline for Oct-Nov confirmed at ~110 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bella waistbelt has shifted to a high Q4 regime, with Period 38 demand reaching 115 units, consistent with the late October/early November surge (P37-P38 average: 111.5). Ghost inventory continues to be a major obstacle: Period 1 (148) and Period 29 (237) are confirmed lost/undelivered, totaling 385 units of 'phantom' pipeline. Total In-transit is 643, which includes these 385 ghost units and the real Period 38 order of 258 units. To force an order and maintain stock for the upcoming holiday peak (November/December), I must override the OR backend's mu_hat. I estimate the proper base stock should cover 110-120 units/week over a 4-period window (L=3 + 1 review). A base stock target of ~480 is required. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 643 In-transit units (including 385 ghost units) from its calculation, I set an explicit mu_hat of 650 to ensure (650 - 643) allows for a meaningful replenishment order while accounting for lead time volatility (L=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative ghost inventory confirmed at 385 units (P1: 148, P29: 237). Q4 seasonal demand baseline is firmly established at ~110-115 units/week (P37-P38 average: 111.5). Lead time remains volatile but centers on 2-3 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (Nov 11) is approaching the peak holiday season. Current status: 0 on-hand inventory and 650 in-transit. The in-transit includes 385 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 1: 148, Period 29: 237) which are confirmed lost/severely delayed and must be bypassed. Actual in-transit is 265 units (P38: 258, P39: 7). Recent demand (P37-P39) averages 103 units, slightly lower than the projected 110-115 baseline, but Q4 seasonality for a fashion accessory (waist belt) suggests sustained high demand. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods). To ensure the OR backend orders despite the 385 units of ghost inventory appearing in its pipeline calculation, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~3 * 115 = 345) PLUS the ghost inventory amount (385), totaling ~730. However, with 265 valid units already in transit, a mu_hat of ~730 will trigger a sufficient replenishment order. I will set L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to 735 to guarantee the system maintains stock for the 115-unit weekly demand while neutralizing the ghost units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 589748001 (Bella waistbelt) is currently in a high-demand Q4 regime with a baseline of approximately 110 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 735 units in-transit, but 385 of these (P1: 148 units, P29: 237 units) are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost/severely delayed shipments) that will not arrive. True pipeline is 350 units (P38: 258, P39: 7, P40: 85). Period 38's order (258 units) is expected to arrive during Period 41 (L=3), which will resolve the current stockout. To bypass the OR engine's 'ghost inventory' blockage (where it sees 735 instead of 350), I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - 735) generates the required order. Target safety stock for L=3 is approximately (L+1)*Demand = 4 * 110 = 440. To achieve a replenishment order despite the 385 unit distortion, mu_hat must be set to approximately 835 (450 target + 385 distortion). I will use explicit values to maintain flow until the game concludes (Period 47).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative ghost inventory confirmed at 385 units (P1: 148, P29: 237) is permanently distorting the automated replenishment logic. Q4 demand is stable at ~100-110 units/week. Lead time is consistently 2-3 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), we are entering the peak holiday shopping season for womens accessories. Demand in Q4 has stabilized at higher levels compared to earlier in the year, with recent demand including a surge of 142 in P33 and averaging ~100 over the Oct-Nov window. The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in P41. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in P1 (148 units) and P29 (237 units), totaling 385 units. Because the OR backend subtracts this 385 from its replenishment calculation, it would underestimate the need for new stock. To force the backend to place an appropriate order, I am setting mu_hat via the 'explicit' method. My target base stock level is approximately (L+1) * Expected_Demand + Safety_Stock. With L set to 3 (recent average) and demand at ~110, plus safety stock, I aim for a base stock around 600. To achieve this while accounting for the 385 units of ghost inventory + other valid in-transit units (P38: 258, P40: 85, P41: 115), I set mu_hat such that the calculated order covers the true demand. I will continue using 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time stability: recent arrivals (P39 order, P37 order) show L=1 to 2, but P29 remains missing and P33 took L=3, so L=2.5-3 is the safe planning horizon. Peak Q4 demand is confirmed at ~100-110 units/week.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 begins with a severe stockout following a demand spike to 187 units in Period 42. Total inventory in-transit is 843, but 385 units (P1: 148, P29: 237) are confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments). Subtracting these, the functional pipeline is 458 units (P38, P40, P41 orders). These orders are scheduled to arrive within the next 1-3 periods according to recent lead-time volatility. Q4 demand is surging, with the average jumping from ~100 to nearly 150 if we include the P42 spike. To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite the 385 ghost units blocking the pipeline, I use an explicit mu_hat set at 150 units/period for (L+1) periods (3+1=4), totaling 600. L is set to explicit 3 to account for the upper end of recent delivery volatility. Sigma is set high to accommodate the extreme volatility (30% of mu).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike in late November (P42: 187 units) suggests a cyber-week or holiday peak earlier than the existing baseline. Ghost inventory remains at 385 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 follows a significant demand spike in Period 42 (187 units) coinciding with late November/Cyber Week, which moderated in Period 43 (67 units). We are now entering the December holiday peak for accessories like the Bella waistbelt. Historical ghost inventory (Period 1: 148, Period 29: 237, total: 385 units) remains in the reported 'In-transit' figure of 643. Subtracting ghost inventory, the actual functional pipeline is 258 units (ordered Period 38). Given the promised lead time of 2 periods and observed volatility (L=1 to 3), the functional pipeline should have arrived, but hasn't yet (P38 order is at L=6, suggesting it might also be delayed or lost). However, we must ensure enough units are ordered to cover the upcoming holiday demand and reconcile against the misleading 385 units of ghost stock. Based on recent demand (P42-P43 average: 127) and seasonal expectations, I set mu_hat explicitly to 550 to force the OR backend's base-stock calculation (which expects on-hand + pipeline to meet demand) to trigger a replenishment order despite the 385 units of ghost 'In-transit' stock. L is set to 3 to account for recent shipping delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Actual functional pipeline (total reported 'In-transit' minus ghost inventory of 385) is critically low or delayed (P38 order of 258 is at L=6). December demand forecast remains high due to seasonal accessories peak.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (Dec 16, 2019), the system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 643 units. This is significantly inflated by two confirmed 'ghost shipments': Period 1 (148 units) and Period 29 (237 units), totaling 385 units that will likely never arrive. The functional pipeline consists of the P38 order (258 units), which is now at L=7 and severely delayed, but remains the primary source of future inventory. Demand analysis: the recent holiday peak (P42: 187) has subsided, but Dec/early-Jan demand for accessories remains seasonally higher than the baseline (~90-110 units/week). My objective is to force an order to maintain coverage while the OR engine incorrectly assumes the 385 ghost units are coming. Setting L=3 reflects the volatile but generally elongated lead times observed in Q4. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 485 (calculated as: 100 base demand * (3+1) periods + 85 to offset a portion of the ghost inventory) ensures the backend moves the 'base_stock' target high enough to trigger a replenishment order despite the false 385 units in the pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Functional pipeline is critically delayed with Period 38 order (258 units) at L=7. Total ghost inventory remains 385 units (P1, P29). Late December demand forecast stabilized at ~100 units/week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), approaching the end of the year. Demand is stabilizing after the late November peak (187) back to a normalized Q4 level of ~80-100 units. A critical issue is the presence of 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (148 units) and Period 29 (237 units), totaling 385 units, which have never arrived and are likely lost. The backend sees 643 units in-transit, but only 258 (from Period 38) are potentially real, and those are now seriously delayed (L=8). On-hand is 0 following a partial fulfillment in Period 45. To force a replenishment order despite the 385 units of ghost inventory blocking the pipeline calculation, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. The target base stock should cover approximately 3-4 periods of demand (L=2-3 + review), roughly 350-400 units. By setting mu_hat = 800 (explicit), the capped OR logic will subtract the 643 in-transit and still suggest an order. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to reflect the current delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Functional pipeline remains critically blocked by 385 units of ghost inventory (P1 and P29). Period 38 order (258 units) is now at L=8 and remains unconfirmed, suggesting significant logistics disruption or loss. Baseline demand has normalized to ~80-90 units post-peak.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are at the end of the calendar year. Period 46 demand (59) shows the expected post-holiday drop. The critical issue remains the massive ghost inventory totaling 643 units (P1: 148, P29: 237, P38: 258 units), as these orders are significantly past the observed lead time of 2-3 periods and are likely lost. The system reports 800 units 'In-transit', but only 157 units (ordered in P46) are actually valid pipeline. This leaves a gap where the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will see 800 + 0, which is much higher than any likely base-stock, thereby blocking all automated ordering. To force a replenishment order that accounts for the post-holiday baseline (approx 60-70 units) and the 0 on-hand status, mu_hat must be set explicitly high to overcome the 643 units of 'ghost' pipeline. We estimate a target base stock of (1+L)*demand_forecast. With L=2 and demand=70, base stock should be ~210. However, to trigger an order while the system thinks there are 800 in transit, mu_hat needs to be set high enough so that base_stock > 800. Setting mu_hat to 850 with L=2 effectively targets a high enough base stock to ensure we aren't stocked out while waiting for the P46 order.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total ghost inventory increased to 643 units (P1: 148, P29: 237, P38: 258) due to P38 failing to arrive after 9 periods. Post-holiday demand baseline is estimated at ~65 units/week.
