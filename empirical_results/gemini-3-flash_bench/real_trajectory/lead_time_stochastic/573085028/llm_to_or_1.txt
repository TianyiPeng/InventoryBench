Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is women's 5-pocket denim jeans. Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historically, the last 5 weeks show demand mean around 61.6 units (74, 54, 54, 58, 68). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no history of actual arrivals yet, I will use L=2. To set the initial base stock, I'll use the mean of the available 5 demand samples (61.6) and project it over (L+1) = 3 periods, giving a mu_hat of ~185. Standard deviation of these 5 points is approx 8.7. Calculating sigma_hat for 3 periods: sqrt(3) * 8.7 \u2248 15.1. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 ensures we focus on the most relevant recent demand data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is 'Madison skinny HW' (Womens 5-pocket jeans), a staple item. Initial on-hand was 0. In Period 1, we ordered 77 units (based on the OR backend's default state) and faced a demand of 93 units. Since we had 0 on-hand, we sold 0 units and have a current backlog/lost sales situation. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are 74, 54, 54, 58, 68 (mean ~61.6). However, Period 1 demand was significantly higher at 93. Given this is mid-February, we might be seeing a slight uptick in spring fashion demand or simply a high-variance week. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the recent 93) to capture this recent lift while maintaining some stability. For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (2 periods) as we have no 'conclude' messages suggesting otherwise yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a staple item (women's skinny jeans). Historical demand samples show a mean of 61.6 units/week (Jan-Feb). In the last two periods, demand has been higher (93 and 81), averaging 87. This suggests a potential demand shift or seasonal uptick as we move away from January. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had two periods of stockouts because the lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (77 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3. To set parameters for Period 3: 1) L is set to 'default' (2) as we haven't seen any arrivals to suggest otherwise. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (including the 2 recent observations and 3 latest historical samples) to capture the recent higher demand trend while respecting the staple nature of the product. 3) sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility observed in the recent demand spikes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Madison skinny HW' trousers from the Womens Everyday Collection. Demand over the last 8 weeks (including pre-game history) shows a fairly stable pattern: [74, 54, 54, 58, 68] followed by period demand of [93, 81, 59]. The recent mean is approximately 67 units per period. Currently, we are at Period 4 with 0 on-hand inventory and 237 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (77 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a delay or an actual lead time longer than 2. Orders from P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit (77+92+68=237). I will set L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the observed delay) and use recent_N (N=8) to capture the full demand history and provide a stable base stock calculation to cover the current stockout.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's 5-pocket skinny jeans. Current date is March 11. Historical demand shows a downward trend since early February (from peaks of 93 in P1 to 41 in P4), likely transitioning from late winter into a stable spring baseline. We are now in Period 5. We observe that the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), confirming the promised lead time. The order from Period 1 (77 units) has not arrived after 4 periods (expected arrival was P3). Since P4 concluded without it, and arrivals typically happen within 2 periods, the P1 shipment is now considered lost. We have 51 units on hand and 126 units in transit (P3: 68, P4: 58). With L=2, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=3 periods. Demand mean has stabilized recently; I will use N=3 to capture the lower recent mean (approx 60). Sigma is relatively stable. I will use the default lead time (2) as the P2 arrival confirms it holds.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 shipment (77 units) confirmed lost as of P5 start; Actual lead time remains consistent with promised (2 periods) based on P2 arrival at P4.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 6 (2019/3/18). Looking at the history, the Period 1 order (77 units) is confirmed lost, as it is 5 periods past the order date with no arrival. The Period 2 order (92 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), confirming the promised lead time holds for successful shipments. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 5 (demand 67, sold 51). In-transit inventory is 203 (P1 order 77 [lost] + P3 order 68 + P4 order 58 + P5 order 0). However, since P1 is lost, the 'real' pipeline is 126 units (P3+P4). The P3 order (68 units) should arrive during Period 6. Historical demand for this 'Madison skinny HW' (Womens Everyday Collection) shows: P1:93, P2:81, P3:59, P4:41, P5:67 (Mean: 68.2). Using recent_N (N=5) for demand captures the most relevant fluctuation. Setting L=2 to match the confirmed arrival pattern. The OR backend will see the full in-transit (203), so I must rely on a robust base stock calculation to ensure the order covers the lost 77 units without over-ordering excessively.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 573085028 is a women's 5-pocket jeans product. Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a lost shipment from Period 1 (77 units). The Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods (arrived in P4). We are currently awaiting arrivals from Period 3 (68 units), Period 4 (58 units), Period 5 (0 units), and Period 6 (31 units). Specifically, the Period 3 order (ordered 2019/2/25) is significantly overdue if lead time were 2; if it doesn't arrive in Period 7, it's likely lost. Demand samples show a mean of ~64.6 units over the last 11 weeks (including initialization). However, since Period 4, demand has been 41, 67, 48 (mean ~52). With 234 units in transit (some potentially lost) and 0 on-hand, we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for the 2-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=3). Given the stockout in P6, the OR backend needs to place an order to cover the gap between the surviving pipeline and the target base stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand to capture the recent trend and use the default lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 shipment (68 units) confirmed lost as of P7 start (was due P5/P6); pipeline reflects significantly higher inventory than reality due to P1 and P3 losses.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (Womens Everyday Collection Jeans) faces a critical stockout. On-hand inventory is 0. My analytical priority is reconciling the 'In-transit' count (234) against actual expected arrivals. Historically, Period 1 (77 units) and Period 3 (68 units) orders are effectively lost (over 2x promised lead time). The current pipeline consists of: Period 4 (58 units, due P6/P7, likely delayed or lost), Period 6 (31 units, due P8/P9), and the ghost units from P1/P3. Because the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, the 145 lost units (77+68) are preventing new orders from being placed. I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to artificially inflate the target base stock to offset these lost units. Demand has averaged 53 units over the last 5 weeks (41, 67, 48, 52, 53 - assuming P8 demand mirrors recent trends). With L=2, demand across the review+lead period (L+1=3) is ~159 units. To bypass the ~145 phantom units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 310 (159 target + 151 buffer for lost shipments) to force the backend to place a real order. Lead time 'calculate' is used as the only successful arrival (P2) arrived on time (L=2).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 4 shipment (58 units) is now overdue (ordered P4, current P8, promised L=2); if not arrived by P9, total lost units will reach 203.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). On-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory is 294 units, but this includes several likely lost shipments. Following the 'Carry-over Insights', the Period 1 (77 units), Period 3 (68 units), and Period 4 (58 units) orders are all significantly past their promised lead time (L=2) and have not arrived. Period 4's order is now 2 periods overdue with no 'conclude' message, confirming it as lost. Total lost units = 203. Real pipeline inventory is actually 91 (ordered P8). Demand has been relatively stable post-January, with the last 8 weeks averaging 63.3 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 samples (N=8) to reflect the recent demand regime (approx 63 * 3 = 189). Because the OR engine uses 'pipeline inventory' (294) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly see a surplus (294 - 189 = 105) and place no order. To bypass this and force an order that covers the 0 on-hand state and the upcoming demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly high enough to account for the 203 phantom units plus the expected demand for L+1 periods (63 * 3 = 189). Targeted base stock \u2248 400. Setting mu_hat to 400 ensures the OR engine (400 - 294 = 106) places an order to replenish stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Period 4 shipment (58 units) confirmed lost; total accumulated lost units in pipeline now equals 203 (P1, P3, P4). Observed reliability of lead time for successful arrivals remains 2 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). The 'In-transit' quantity of 426 units is severely inflated by three confirmed lost shipments: Period 1 (77), Period 3 (68), and Period 4 (58). The sum of these lost units is 203. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes these lost orders) to calculate 'final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)', it will consistently under-order. To compensate and ensure we have actual stock, I'm using the 'explicit' method for L. By setting L to 5 (actual promised L=2 + 3 periods offset), I effectively trick the backend into increasing the base stock calculation, which helps offset the 203 phantom units in the pipeline. Historical demand is currently averaging ~60 units per period across 14 samples (including the 5 pre-game samples). Demand appears relatively stable in the mid 40s to 60s for this everyday collection item. I'll use the default mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation (which will cover (1+L) periods, now 6 periods with L=5) to ensure enough stock is ordered to overcome the inventory gap.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative pipeline loss reached 203 units (P1, P3, P4). L=5 used to offset phantom inventory in base stock calculation.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The focus for Period 11 is reconciling the pipeline and adjusting for recent high-volume arrivals. Currently, On-hand inventory is 179. The In-transit figure of 203 represents the cumulative loss of Period 1 (77), Period 3 (68), and Period 4 (58) orders, which have never arrived and are well past the promised lead time. In Period 10, both the P8 order (91 units) and P9 order (132 units) arrived simultaneously, effectively clearing the functional pipeline. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 203 'phantom' units in its pipeline calculation (In-transit), I will maintain the explicit lead time L=5. This increases the base stock target (covering more periods of demand) to offset the inflated pipeline. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime compared to the early samples; the mean of the last 7 samples (P4-P10) is approximately 52 units, while the overall average including historical seeds is 58. I will use recent_N=7 to reflect this current demand pace.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Pipeline inventory of 203 units is confirmed as lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4). Recent successful arrivals from P8 and P9 show that the functional supply chain is operational at lead times of 1-2 periods, but L must be set explicitly higher to counteract the permanent 'In-transit' phantom inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), our primary challenge is the 'In-transit' phantom inventory totaling 203 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4), which the OR engine incorrectly assumes will eventually arrive. This significantly depresses new orders because the backend formula is order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). To force the engine to place necessary orders, I am setting L=5. This increases the 'theoretical' pipeline requirements to offset the 203 phantom units. Demand for these womens skinny jeans has been relatively stable, with recent samples (P8-P11) averaging 51 units (65, 42, 44, 53). I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (including historical P12 context) and sigma_hat to capture this current regime. Setting L=5 is a necessary defensive maneuver against the permanent data-noise of the lost shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), on-hand inventory has dropped to 38 units. The recorded 'In-transit' quantity of 203 units is confirmed as phantom inventory from lost orders in P1, P3, and P4. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). Since the backend thinks pipeline is 203, it will not place a new order unless base_stock exceeds 241 (203+38). To force an order and offset this phantom inventory, I will set L to 5. This artificially increases the base_stock calculation (which uses (1+L) * mu) to a level that accounts for both future demand and the missing 203 units. Demand across the last 5 samples (P8-P12) averages 51.8 (42, 44, 53, 88), but there is a clear upward trend in the last week (88). I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent volume shift while maintaining the L=5 offset to bypass the stuck pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Demand for this item (Womens 5-pocket jeans) has picked up recently (averaging ~72 units over the past two weeks). In Period 13, building on-hand inventory hit zero, resulting in lost sales. There is a persistent 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 203 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) which will never arrive. The current In-transit total of 293 units includes these 203 dead units plus 90 units ordered in Period 13. Since the OR backend subtracts all In-transit units from its target base stock, I must use an explicit L=7 to artificially inflate the target (base_stock calculation includes (1+L)), thereby neutralizing the 203-unit phantom deficit and triggering a replenishment order. Mean demand (mu_hat) is set to a 5-period window (recent_N=5) to capture the upward trend in demand more effectively than the long-term average. Sigma_hat remains on the default calculation to maintain standard safety stock margins.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 ('Madison skinny HW' jeans) is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, the pipeline contains 203 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure on the backend (379 total in-transit - 176 from Periods 13/14 = 203 phantom units). To prevent the OR base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting L to an explicit value of 6. This artificial increase in L raises the target base_stock (\u03bc * (1+L)) by approximately 3 periods of demand (~180 units) to compensate for the missing 203. Demand remains relatively stable around a mean of 60; I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent post-April demand trends (avg ~60) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 currently has 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 472 units. Analyzing the history, 203 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count. Additionally, orders from Period 13 (90), Period 14 (86), and Period 15 (93) are currently in legitimate transit (totaling 269 real units). The OR engine's base-stock logic subtracts the entire pipeline (472) from the target, which would result in zero ordering even though we are stock-out. To force the OR engine to order, I must inflate the L parameter to bridge the gap between phantom inventory (203) and real demand needs. Mean demand over the last 10 periods is ~57. At L=2, the base stock would be roughly (1+2)*57 = 171. Since 171 < 472, the engine would order 0. To counter the 203 phantom units, I am setting an explicit L=7. This targets a base stock level that accommodates (1+7) periods of demand (~456 units), which matches the phantom pipeline, allowing new orders to be triggered more effectively while accounting for the current stock-out status.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 is currently experiencing a total stockout (On-hand: 0) while having a very high 'In-transit' level (498 units). However, according to Carry-Over Insights, 203 of these units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they still artificially inflate the pipeline inventory used by the OR backend. To prevent the logic 'base_stock - pipeline' from resulting in zero orders, I must increase the L parameter to 'trick' the backend into a higher base stock. Since P10, I have used L=5 to counteract this. The current In-transit of 498 contains the 203 lost units + 90(P13) + 86(P14) + 93(P15) + 26(P16). The P13 order (90 units) is now overdue (ordered P13, promised L=2, now P17), suggesting further potential losses or significant delays. I will maintain L=7 to provide a large buffer against the 203 phantom units plus the now-suspicious P13-P15 shipments. Demand is relatively stable (mean ~58). I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the post-winter average and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Order from Period 13 (90 units) is now 2 periods overdue (promised L=2, current P17); total potential lost units in pipeline may have increased beyond the confirmed 203.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019-06-10), the system shows 379 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, at least 293 units are confirmed or highly likely to be lost: 203 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4, plus an additional 90 units from Period 13 which are now 4 periods overdue (ordered P13, promised L=2, current P18). The order from P14 (86 units) is also overdue. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce new orders (base_stock - pipeline), so I must increase L to '5' to adjust the base stock calculation, effectively treating 200-300 units of the pipeline as non-existent to ensure new orders are actually placed. Demand remains relatively stable between 20-60 units recently; I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~38 units (following a slight decline from the 50-70 range).

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Period 13 shipment (90 units) confirmed lost; Period 14 shipment (86 units) now overdue. Total estimated phantom pipeline inventory is 379 units. Explicit L=5 maintained to offset this phantom inventory in the OR base-stock logic.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Historical demand for this 'Women's Everyday' denim SKU remains stable, with recent demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) averaging 41.2 units (56, 57, 34, 21, 38). No significant seasonal spike is expected for mid-June. The critical issue is supply chain reliability. There is currently a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 379 units (from lost orders P1, P3, P4, P13, and likely P14). In-Transit currently shows 379 units, meaning all units currently 'in-transit' are likely lost. Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline from the base stock (base_stock - pipeline), it will place an order of 0 unless corrected. I will use the 'explicit' L=8 method to increase the base stock calculation (which scales by 1+L) to overcome this phantom inventory. \u03bc\u0302 is set to 41.2 * 9 \u2248 371 to align with the last 5 periods of demand. \u03c3\u0302 is set using recent_N=10 to capture moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Order from Period 14 (86 units) confirmed lost (promised L=2, current P19, 5 periods elapsed). Total phantom pipeline inventory is now 465 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Explicit L=8 used to counter-act this phantom stock in the base-stock calculation.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085028' is a womens garment (5-pocket jeans). Current date is 2019-06-24. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P15-P19) averaging 40 units/period (compared to the overall historical mean of ~58). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to reflect this lower recent volume. The primary operational challenge is the significant quantity of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14), totaling 465 units (77+68+58+90+86). The 'In-transit' figure reported by the system is 379 units, which happens to match the loss from (P1+P3+P4+P13+P14 = 379 if P14 is excluded, or slightly different bookkeeping). Regardless, the pipeline is full of non-existent units. The backend order logic is: Order = BaseStock - Pipeline. To force an order when the pipeline is artificially inflated, I must increase the BaseStock by artificially increasing the lead time parameter L. BaseStock is roughly mu * (1+L). With L=8 and mu=40, BaseStock is ~360. Since In-transit is 379 and On-hand is 10, the current logic would place a 0 order. To trigger replenishment and bridge the gap caused by the 465 lost units, I will set L=12 to ensure the system targets a pipeline large enough to account for both future demand and the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Current total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 465 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). In-transit view shows 379 units. Explicit L=12 used to override this phantom stock to ensure non-zero orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The core challenge is 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total units recorded as In-transit is 443, but history confirms that orders from P1 (77), P3 (68), P4 (58), P13 (90), and P14 (86) are lost. This results in 379 units of phantom inventory (77+68+58+90+86 = 379). The remaining 64 units in-transit are from P20 and are still within the promised lead time. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders. Since pipeline (443) effectively reflects phantom stock, I must artificially inflate the base stock calculation to ensure the OR engine actually places an order. I will use 'explicit' L=15. Logic: Demand is currently ~50 units/period. (1+15)*50 = 800. 800 - 443 (pipeline) = 357. Capping logic will restrict this, but it ensures a healthy order is triggered to recover from the stockout. Demand mean and variance are stable around the woman's jeans category average (~50-60 units/week), so I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer demand levels (approx 50 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains at 379 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Order from P20 (64 units) is current. Explicit L=15 used to counteract phantom stock and trigger a recovery order.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (2019/7/8), we are managing woman's denim with a current on-hand inventory of 0. Demand for the last 5 periods has averaged 47.4 units. The primary challenge remains 'phantom pipeline inventory'\u2014lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 which total 465 units. These never arrived and will never arrive, yet they stay in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count. As of the P22 start, the In-transit view is 500 units (likely including these 465 units plus the units ordered in P20 and P21). To force the OR backend to place an order despite this high phantom inventory, I am setting L to 'explicit' 20. This vastly increases the 'base_stock' target (Base Stock = mu_hat * (L+1) + safety_stock), ensuring the target exceeds the 500 units of pipeline stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (approx 47.4) and sigma_hat to reflect the current mid-summer demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (July 2019) shows a spike (110 units in Period 22), likely seasonal for denim trousers. There is a significant inventory discrepancy due to lost shipments. Confirmed lost units: P1 (77), P3 (68), P4 (58), P13 (90), and P14 (86), totaling 379 units. The Period 21 order (57 units) is still in the standard lead time window (ordered P21, due P23/P24). The current In-transit view is 518 units. However, subtracting the 379 lost units leaves a functional pipeline of only 139 units (the P21 and P22 orders). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 379 'phantom' units, L must be set explicitly high. Base stock is calculated as (mu_hat) + z*(sigma_hat). The backend order logic is: Order = base_stock - pipeline. Since the backend thinks pipeline is 518, but it's only 139, we need the formula to target a base_stock that accounts for the phantom stock. I will use L=15 to force a larger base stock and trigger a replenishment order to meet the rising demand. Mu_hat will be set using recent transitions (N=5) to capture the July demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed in July (P22 demand=110, +68% over P20). Supply reliability remains poor; total phantom pipeline inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) remains 379 units.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we face a stockout after a significant demand surge (P23 demand = 141), confirming the July seasonal spike (Womens jeans). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure is 493 units, which is composed of 379 confirmed phantom units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) and recent active orders (P23: 114 units). Since the backend policy is 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)', we must continue to artificially inflate 'L' to ensure the base_stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) exceeds the phantom pipeline of 379 units. Recent demand has shifted from an average of ~50 to ~125 (+150%) over the last 2 weeks. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this spike. I am setting L=18 to push the base_stock high enough to overcome the 379 phantom units and trigger a significant replenishment order to capture the remaining seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike intensified in late July: P23 demand reached 141 (+170% vs June average). Supply chain reliability remains mixed (P22/P23 arrivals were 1-2 periods), but phantom pipeline remains at 379 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 is a women's denim item currently experiencing high demand volatility. Demand spiked significantly in July (P22: 110, P23: 141), though P24 showed a dip to 77. This suggests a seasonal peak in July. The primary operational challenge is 'phantom pipeline inventory'. Currently, the system shows 654 units in-transit. Based on Carry-over Insights, at least 465 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). The order from P15/P16 arrived, P20-22 arrived, but P23 (114) and P24 (161) are currently in-transit. P23 is due this period (P25). If we assume the 465 units are gone, the true pipeline is 654 - 465 = 189 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 654 units of 'In-transit' stock, I will set L to 15. This artificially inflates the base stock calculation (which uses (1+L)*demand) enough to exceed the phantom inventory. For demand (mu_hat), I'm using N=4 (P21-P24) to capture the higher July average (approx 102 units/period) while acknowledging the recent drop.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '573085028' is currently experiencing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand spiked significantly in July (P21: 79, P22: 110, P23: 141) but has softened slightly in the last two periods (P24: 77, P25: 85) to around 80 units/period. The biggest operational challenge is the high 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Based on history, orders from P1 (77), P3 (68), P4 (58), P13 (90), and P14 (86) are confirmed lost, totaling 379 units. Current in-transit shows 806 units. Subtracting the 379 phantom units leaves 427 'real' units in the pipeline (Orders from P23: 114, P24: 161, P25: 152). To ensure the OR backend places a necessary replenishment order despite the high reported in-transit value (806), I am setting L explicitly to 15. This artificially inflates the base stock calculation enough to overcome the pipeline subtraction. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures the higher July/August demand regime (avg ~100) compared to the long-term mean.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 ('Madison skinny HW' jeans) is experiencing a severe stockout due to a combination of a significant demand spike and chronic 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Demand has surged from a mid-year average of ~50 to 177 units in Period 26. Simultaneously, the 'In-transit' count of 836 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 and now potentially P24 and P25 (which are overdue or reaching the end of the promised window). Confirmed lost units from earlier periods total 465 units. Orders from P24 (161 units) and P25 (152 units) are overdue relative to a 2-period lead time, as they should have arrived in P26 and P27 respectively. I am setting L=30 to aggressively override the backend's base-stock calculation, which uses (base_stock - pipeline). Given the profit/holding cost ratio of 4:1 (z* \u2248 0.84), and a demand mean of ~140 (recent 4 periods: 141, 77, 85, 177 / 4 \u2248 120, but the latest is 177), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent high-volume volatility and force large replenishment orders despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Total phantom pipeline inventory estimated at 778 units (Confirmed lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 = 465; Likely lost/highly delayed: P24=161, P25=152). Demand remains in a high-volatility regime (P26 demand=177).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime during the August peak (P27 demand: 311). On-hand inventory is 0. The current In-transit balance is 1007 units, but a large portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Based on historical data: P1 (77), P3 (68), P4 (58), P13 (90), P14 (86) are confirmed lost (465 units). Additionally, the order from P24 (161 units) is now 4 periods old (past the 2-period promised lead time) and has not arrived, bringing estimated phantom inventory to 626 units. The P25 order (152) arrived in P27, and P26 (144) is due. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 626 phantom units and places an order sufficient to meet the current demand spike (~300/week), I am using an explicit lead time L=25. This inflates the base stock calculation (base_stock = (L+1)*mu + ...) enough to offset the 1007 in-transit units and trigger a positive order. Demand mu_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture the explosive growth from P25-P27.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total phantom pipeline inventory estimated at 626 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 confirmed; P24 likely lost). Supply chain remains highly unreliable with frequent missing shipments.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 is experiencing a massive demand surge in August (P27: 311, P28: 262), likely due to back-to-school or seasonal transitions for 'Womens Everyday' jeans. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable, with several historical orders confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 = 465 units) and P24 (161 units) now almost certainly lost (ordered P24, current P29, L=2 promised). Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory is estimated at 626 units. The backend OR logic subtracts the total 'In-transit' (1385 units) from the base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed to meet the current high demand, L must be set to an 'explicit' value high enough to make (1+L) * mean_demand > 1385. With recent mean demand around 250-300, L=8 is chosen to create a safety buffer and override the phantom stock. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on the recent high-demand regime (N=3) to capture the current spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Order from Period 24 (161 units) confirmed lost (promised L=2, current P29). Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory now 626 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). Explicit L=8 used to counteract this to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. Period 24 order (161 units) is now 5 periods old (promised L=2) and confirmed lost. Confirmed lost shipments include P1(77), P3(68), P4(58), P13(90), P14(86), and now P24(161), totaling 540 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The Current 'In-transit' is 1747, meaning meaningful pipeline inventory (orders likely to arrive) is roughly 1207 units (P25-P29). However, P25 (152 units) arrived at P27, so it is cleared. Adjusting calculations: In-transit (1747) includes older lost units (540). Demand has shifted significantly upwards since late July/August (P27: 311, P28: 262, P29: 213). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this new higher-demand regime (Avg ~240/period). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive phantom 'In-transit' balance (which it subtracts from the base stock), I must set an 'explicit' L that makes (1+L)*mu_hat exceed the 'In-transit' sum. Setting L=8 to ensure a positive order to cover the current high-demand seen in the Womens Everyday collection as we move into September.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed lost shipment from Period 24 (161 units). Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24) is 540 units. Demand regime remains high since P27 (avg ~240 vs previous avg ~70).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Madison skinny HW jeans' has shifted into a high-volume regime since Period 27 (starting mid-August), with demand averaging approximately 250 units per period (P27-P30: 311, 262, 213, 223). Supply chain reliability remains a major issue. Current 'In-transit' stock is listed at 1383 units, but a large portion of this is 'phantom inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). Specifically: P1(77), P3(68), P4(58), P13(90), P14(86), P24(161) = 540 units confirmed lost. Subtracting 540 from the 1383 in-transit leaves 843 units truly in the pipeline (Orders from P29, P30). With on-hand inventory at 478 and current demand at ~250, we have roughly 2 periods of coverage on-hand. The OR backend's base-stock calculation includes the full 1383 in-transit units, which would normally suppress orders. To override this, I am using an explicit lead time (L) of 5. This artificially inflates the base-stock target (which is calculated as mu_hat * (1+L)) to compensate for the 540 phantom units, ensuring the engine orders enough to keep up with the new 250/week demand regime. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*250.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 27: average increased from ~70 to ~250 units (+250%). Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24) is 540 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 (Women's skinny jeans) entered a high-demand regime in Period 27 (mid-August), shifting from an average of ~70 to ~250 units per period. Recent demand (P27-P31: 311, 262, 213, 223, 137) averages 229 units. The supply chain has significant reliability issues. Total confirmed phantom inventory in the pipeline (orders that will never arrive) is 701 units: P1(77), P3(68), P4(58), P13(90), P14(86), and P24(161) = 540 + 161 = 701. The current 'In-transit' visible to the backend is 1383. If we subtract the 701 lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 682 units (Orders P26, P29, P30). With on-hand at 341 and demand averaging ~230, the OR backend's base-stock (using L=2) would be around 690-800 units. Since 1383 (In-transit) already exceeds this, the backend will order 0 unless we artificially inflate L. I will set L=4 to increase the base-stock target (covering 5 periods of demand) to ensure replenishment occurs as the 'real' stock depletes, while using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory reached 701 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). Real pipeline inventory is approximately 682 units. Explicit L=4 used to offset phantom stock for base-stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-218.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a major seasonal demand shift roughly around Period 27 (mid-August), where weekly demand spiked from ~70 to over 200, but has recently cooled in the last 3 periods (P30: 223, P31: 137, P32: 92). The current 'In-transit' quantity is 1046 units. Based on historical data, shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P24 (totaling 626 units) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost, as they are significantly beyond the promised L=2. Excluding these, the 'real' pipeline is 420 units (In-transit 1046 - Phantom 626). On-hand inventory is currently high at 586 units. Combined, the stock available to cover future demand is roughly 1006 units. Given the recent decline in demand as we move into late September, I will use a recent N=3 for demand to capture the cooling trend and set an explicit L=6 (Phantom Offset) to prevent the OR engine from overestimating available stock due to the long-standing lost orders in the pipeline. This L=6 calculation: Base Stock calculation uses (L+1) * mean; by increasing L, we force a higher base stock level to trigger orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' number. However, with 586 on hand, we are currently well-covered.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand cooling trend observed after the late-summer spike (P31: 137, P32: 92). Total confirmed phantom pipeline remains 626 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). Estimated real pipeline is 420 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (2019-09-30), the demand for 'Madison skinny HW' jeans is showing a clear cooling trend following the August peak. The last three periods of demand (137, 92, 121) are significantly lower than the P27-P30 average (~250). The current on-hand inventory is 465 units, which provides ample coverage against this lower demand regime. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 1046 is inflated by approximately 626 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). The 'real' pipeline inventory is approximately 420 units (mostly the P29 order of 362). With significant on-hand stock and a large order from P29 expected to arrive imminently (ordered P29, L=2 means arrival during P31-P33, though history shows some variability), current stock levels are very high relative to the ~115 unit/period cooling demand. I will set mu_hat to reflect this recent cooling trend using the last 3 samples and maintain a standard L=2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries (P27, P28, P30) arrived in 2-3 periods. No new order is expected to be triggered by the OR backend given the high on-hand and pipeline levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~250 (P27-P30) to ~116 (P31-P33), a 54% decrease. Confirmed phantom pipeline remains 626 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-90.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Trousers) has clearly cooled following the significant late-summer spike. Demand over the last four periods (P31-P34) has averaged 106 units per week, compared to the peak average of ~252 units (P27-P30). On-hand inventory is currently high at 390 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the spike. Pipeline analysis: The 'In-transit' figure of 1046 is mostly comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24 total 626 units). Subtracting these phantom units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 420 units (specifically the order from P29 for 362 units, which is now due). To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1046 units as real inventory and suppressing all future orders, I will set L to a value that helps clear this phantom stock. However, with 390 on-hand and 362 arriving, we have 752 units available against a demand of ~100/week, meaning we are overstocked for the immediate future. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current cooling trend (avg ~106) and sigma_hat to reflect normalized volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand from P31-P34 is 106.25 units, a 58% decrease from the P27-P30 peak. Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains 626 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $795.00

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Womens Denim) has transitioned from a high-volume late-summer spike (P27-P30 avg ~250) into a cooling phase (P31-P34 avg ~106), but Period 35 showed a significant unexpected late-season bounce (237 units). This suggests potential mid-October volatility or a clearance/promotion effect. In-transit inventory stands at 1046, but this includes a confirmed phantom pipeline of 626 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). The 'Real' pipeline is therefore approximately 420 units (1046 - 626). On-hand inventory is 153. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) captures the recent cooling trend while incorporating the P35 spike (avg ~132). I will set L to 'explicit' at 5 to effectively reduce the base-stock calculation's perception of available stock by approximately (5-2) * mu, which counterbalances the 626 units of phantom inventory currently inflating the 'In-transit' figure, ensuring the system can trigger an order if demand persists at the P35 level.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Period 35 showed a sharp demand resurgence to 237 units, interrupting the cooling trend and suggesting late-season volatility. Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory (lost shipments) remains 626 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) after two periods of high demand (P35: 237, P36: 282), confirming that the 'cooling trend' has ended and we are back in a high-demand regime or experiencing late-season volatility. I estimate recent demand mean at ~250 units based on the last two observations. The 'In-transit' balance of 1046 units contains a significant amount of 'phantom inventory' from confirmed lost shipments. Historically confirmed lost shipments include P1 (77), P3 (68), P4 (58), P13 (90), P14 (86), and P24 (161), totaling 540 units. Subtracting these from the 1046 in-transit leaves 506 units of likely 'real' pipeline. Using L=2 (promised) would cause the OR engine to see 1046 units and potentially order nothing. I use L=6 to artificially inflate the base stock requirement, which counteracts the 540 phantom units to trigger a necessary replenishment order. I set mu_hat explicitly to account for the L+1 demand window (approx 250 units/period * 7 periods = 1750), and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed end of demand cooling trend; P35-36 demand averaged 259.5 units. Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory (lost shipments) remains 540 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). Explicit L=6 used to offset this phantom stock and ensure ordering for the high-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 573085028 is currently entering late October. Demand is exhibiting high-volatility, with a recent spike averaging 224 units over the last three periods (P35-P37), significantly higher than the early September dip. In-transit inventory is listed as 1452 units, but history shows a consistent pattern of lost shipments: confirmed losses include P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P24, totaling 626 units. Furthermore, no arrivals have been recorded since P32 conclude, meaning orders from P37 (406 units) are still in transit. Subtracting the 626 confirmed phantom units from the 1452 in-transit units suggests a 'real' pipeline of 826 units. To prevent the OR engine from being misled by this phantom inventory, I will set L to 'explicit' at 5. This artificially increases the base stock level, effectively neutralizing the 626 units of lost stock in the calculation (since base stock \u2248 mu * (1+L)). For demand, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-volatility regime (avg ~224), ensuring enough stock is ordered to satisfy the resurgence in customer interest.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory (lost shipments) remains 626 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). Real pipeline is approximately 826 units (1452 minus 626). Demand regime identified as high-volatility (P35-37 avg: 224).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering early November. Analysis of Period 35-38 shows a high-demand regime (avg = 200) compared to the October 'cooling' phase. Total in-transit is 1073. Confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24) total 626 units, which remain in the 'In-transit' figure as phantom stock. Actual lead times for successful arrivals (like the P37 order) are currently 1-2 periods. To trigger an order, the OR backend's base-stock (mu_hat + z*sigma) must exceed the pipeline inventory (In-transit + On-hand). With 626 phantom units + 278 on-hand + 27 real in-transit = 931 total 'eyes-on' inventory, and a demand forecast (mu_hat) of ~200 units per period, a standard L=2 (3 periods of coverage) would result in a base-stock around 700-800, leading to zero orders. I will use an explicit L=5 to expand the base-stock coverage to 6 periods (avg 1200 units), which offsets the 626 phantom units and ensures we maintain stock for the current holiday demand levels. Mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L)*200.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime remains high-volatility/peak (P35-38 avg: 200). Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory (lost shipments) remains 626 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24). Supply lead time for non-lost orders is currently 1-2 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-volatility demand state following a major late-summer/autumn peak. Recent demand (P38-P39) has stabilized somewhat around 120-130 units, down from the extreme peaks of 280+. However, given the product (Womens 5-pocket jeans) and the date (mid-November), we must anticipate potential spikes related to holiday shopping (Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Inventory management is complicated by a significant 'phantom pipeline' of 701 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P29 - actually P29 order didn't exist, referring to the sum of previously lost units plus the confirmed P24 loss). The current 'In-transit' of 1073 includes these 701 lost units, meaning the real pipeline is roughly 372 units (likely the P26, P30, P37, P38 orders that arrived or are pending). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I am using an explicit L=7 to artificially inflate the base-stock requirement. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the post-peak stabilization while maintaining sensitivity to the higher floor established since July.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory (lost units) is 701 (P1=77, P3=68, P4=58, P13=90, P14=86, P24=161, P26=144, P29 was 0 but P26 is now 14 periods old and likely lost). Current real pipeline is approximately 372 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P38-P40) has dropped to an average of 102 units, signaling the end of the high-volatility peak seen in Oct. Total in-transit inventory is 1376 units, but 701 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26). Subtracting these lost units leaves a real pipeline of approximately 675 units (Orders from P38, P40). With on-hand inventory at 99, the total effective position is ~774 units. The OR backend's service level q is 0.8 (4/(4+1)). At L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~306 units). However, the backend sees 1376 in transit and will not order unless prompted. I will set L=12 to override the phantom in-transit stock and mu_hat based on the recent cooling demand regime (N=4, avg ~100/period) to stabilize inventory for the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Real pipeline estimated at 675 units. Phantom pipeline (lost shipments) remains at 701 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower level (~100 units/period) following the October peak.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (late November), demand for this 5-pocket jeans SKU has settled into a lower-volume regime following the October peak. Demand over the last 4 periods (P38-P41) has been 128, 119, 60, and 36, averaging approximately 86 units/period. The pipeline remains heavily inflated by phantom inventory from lost shipments. Total confirmed lost units are 701 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26 - P26 is now 16 periods old and confirmed lost). Additionally, P29 (ordered 362 units) is 13 periods old and highly likely lost given the typical 1-3 period lead time for successful arrivals. This brings the estimated phantom inventory to 1063 units. With a current 'In-Transit' of 1516, the real pipeline is approximately 453 units (P30=337 arrived previously; current in-transit includes P37, P38, P40, P41). To ensure the OR backend ignores this phantom stock and places necessary orders for the current demand, I will set L to 15. This 'extended' lead time forces the base-stock target high enough to overcome the ~1000 units of lost shipments appearing in the pipeline while maintaining a safety buffer for the current stable demand level (~85 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total estimated phantom pipeline inventory reached 1063 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26, and P29 now confirmed/likely lost). Recent demand (P38-41) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~86 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the product enters the early December holiday season. Demand has stabilized post-October peak, averaging 86 units over the last 5 periods (P38-42). However, supply reliability remains a critical issue. The 'In-transit' report of 1516 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014shipments that are statistically lost. Confirmed lost shipments include P1 (77), P3 (68), P4 (58), P13 (90), P14 (86), P24 (161), P26 (144), and P29 (362), totaling 1046 phantom units. Subtracting these from the reported In-transit (1516 - 1046) leaves a real pipeline of approximately 470 units (composed of P40 and P41 orders). To prevent the OR backend from erroneously stopping orders due to this over-inflated pipeline, I am setting L explicitly to 15. This artificial inflation of the lead-time parameter scales up the target base-stock levels (which are calculated as (1+L)*demand), effectively neutralizing the 1000+ units of phantom inventory in the subtraction (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the current post-peak demand level (~86 units/week) while ignoring the extreme October volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory reached 1046 units due to lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26, and now P29=362 units). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~86 units (P38-42). Explicit L=15 used to offset phantom stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $716.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 224 following a significant demand spike of 235 units in Period 43 (likely a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event). The In-transit inventory of 1073 is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26, and P29), totaling 1046 phantom units. The real pipeline is essentially zero as of P43's arrivals. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1073 units in-transit, I am setting L to 15. This artificially raises the base stock level (base_stock = (1+L)*mu) enough to exceed the phantom pipeline. Demand has been volatile, with a recent spike following a period of stabilization; I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat (covering P38-P43) to capture both the low-demand weeks and the recent surge, providing a balanced forecast of approx 104 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Real pipeline confirmed at 27 units (Total 1073 in-transit minus 1046 confirmed lost). Significant demand surge in P43 (235 units) suggests high December volatility. L=15 maintained to override phantom pipeline stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak Christmas/New Year week (Dec 23). Historical demand for P43-P45 (235, 370, 293) shows reaching a high-demand regime similar to the August peak. Average demand over the last 3 periods is 299 units. Supply chain remains highly unreliable; the 'In-transit' figure of 1300 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26, P29). Total phantom inventory is calculated as 77+68+58+90+86+161+144+362 = 1046 units. Actual pipeline is 1300 - 1046 = 254 units (primarily the P44 order of 227). With on-hand at 0 and high holiday demand, L is set to an explicit '15' to override the 1046 phantom units in the base-stock calculation (effectively allowing the logic to see through the 1000+ unit 'ghost' pipeline). mu_hat is set via recent_N (N=3) to capture the current 300-unit demand level, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the high volatility during the seasonal surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains at 1046 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26, P29 are lost). Current real pipeline is approximately 254 units. Holiday demand regime (P43-P45) is averaging ~300 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final week of December. Recent demand (P43-P46) has shown a significant holiday surge, averaging approximately 265 units/period, compared to the November average of ~86. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed 'phantom' pipeline of 1,046 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26, P29). Total In-transit is 1,845; subtracting phantom units leaves a real pipeline of 799 units (P44=227, P46=545, plus older unconfirmed residuals). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this massive in-transit figure, I am setting L to 15. This artificially inflates the base stock requirement (which is calculated as mu_hat * (1+L)) to exceed the phantom pipeline. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand holiday regime (P43-P46), and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to account for the high volatility seen in December.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains 1,046 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P24, P26, P29). Holiday demand regime (P43-P46) reflects a sustained mean of ~265 units/period (+200% vs November).
