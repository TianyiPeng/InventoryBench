Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 160442007 (3p Sneaker Socks). The historical demand for the past 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a mean of 110 units and a standard deviation of approximately 14.5 units. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Since we have no on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given February is generally a stable month for basic apparel items like socks, I will use the full historical sample (N=5) to set the initial parameters. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', a seasonal item that typically sees increased demand as weather warms up. In Period 1, we had a demand of 114 units, but since our starting on-hand was 0 and our first order (139 units) won't arrive until at least Period 3 (promised lead time = 2), we sold 0 units and ended with 0 inventory. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are [123, 105, 114, 133, 95], averaging 114. The Period 1 demand of 114 is perfectly in line with this average. Since we are just starting and have no evidence of lead time deviations yet, I will use 'default' for L (promised = 2). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stable demand around the mean of 114 units, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock covering (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The product is 3p Sneaker Socks. History shows a significant demand spike in Period 2 (231 units) compared to the initial samples (avg ~114) and Period 1 (114). This likely reflects a seasonal shift as we move towards spring/warmer weather in late February. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order (139 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the lead time rules, an order placed in P1 with L=2 should arrive during P3's arrival resolution and be visible in P3 conclude (visible at P4 start). We currently have 274 units in-transit (139 from P1 + 135 from P2). I will set L to 'default' (2). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=2 to capture the recent demand surge (avg 172.5), protecting against stockouts during this potential seasonal transition. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 (including P1 demand and the two highest samples from history) to account for increased volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 4 (2019/3/4), the SKU is '3p Sneaker Socks'. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) averaged ~114, but recent periods (P2, P3) show a significant surge to 231 and 203. This indicates a demand regime shift, likely due to spring seasonality (sneaker socks). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P1 (139 units) and P2 (135 units) have not yet concluded. Given the 1-period observation delay, P1's order should have arrived during P3 and be visible now, but 'arrived=0' is listed for P3. This suggests P1's shipment is at least one period late or the actual lead time is 3+ periods. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this delay and use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the recent upward trend (~217 avg) and high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 2: mean demand increased from ~114 to ~217 (+90%) due to spring seasonality for sneaker socks. Potential lead time extension observed: Period 1 order (L=2) not arrived by Period 3 conclude.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. Demand for sneaker socks has shifted upward due to spring seasonality. The Period 4 conclusion confirms that the Period 2 order (135 units) arrived with the promised lead time of 2 periods, however, the Period 1 order (139 units) is notably missing (ordered P1, expected P3 conclude). This suggests the Period 1 shipment is likely lost. Demand in Period 4 was 138 units, mostly met by the Period 2 arrival, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Average demand since the regime shift (P2-P4) is 190.6 units ((231+203+138)/3). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand scenario and set L to 'explicit' at 2 (treating P1 as lost rather than delayed, as P2 arrived on time). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 2nd and 3rd periods out (L+1 coverage) to prevent persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 shipment (139 units) is confirmed lost: Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2) while Period 1 remains undelivered. Demand regime shift confirmed: avg 191 units/week vs prior ~114 units.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (March 18). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which typically sees a seasonal demand spike as spring approaches. Historical demand from Periods 2-5 shows a mean of 179.75 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline (~114). The Carry-over insights confirm that the Period 1 order (139 units) is lost, as the Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2) while Period 1 remains in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 699 units in transit (orders from P3 and P4). To recover from the lost shipment and stockouts while accounting for the spring regime, I will use a recent demand window (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time L will remain at the promised value of 2, as the Period 4 arrival confirmed L=2 is still the functioning norm for successful deliveries.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/25. We are managing 3p Sneaker Socks, which exhibit strong spring seasonality (demand shift from ~114 to ~190+ avg). Since Period 1, we've faced stockouts due to a lost shipment (Period 1 order of 139 units) and insufficient safety stock to handle the demand surge. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2), so we treat L=2 as reliable despite the Period 1 loss. There are 699 units currently in-transit (Orders from P3: 294 and P4: 266, plus P5/P6 were zero), and on-hand is 0. The P3 order (294 units) is expected to arrive this period (P7) but we only see confirmation in P8's update. Demand over the last 5 periods (P2-P6) has averaged ~187 units. To recover service levels and prevent stockouts during this seasonal peak, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime, and maintaining recent lead time calculation (L=2). This will calculate a base stock covering (2+1)=3 periods of demand (~560 units). Since pipeline (699) exceeds current base stock, the OR engine will likely order 0 or only minimal amounts until stockouts clear, but we must ensure mu_hat reflects the new reality.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). The product (3p Sneaker Socks) is entering its peak spring season. Historical data and recent periods show a significant demand regime shift. Since Period 2, demand has averaged ~191 units, but the last three periods (5, 6, 7) show a clear upward trend (147, 214, 285). The Period 7 demand of 285 units indicates a sharp seasonal acceleration. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 699 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 3 and 4). Period 3's order (294 units) should have arrived in Period 5 (if L=2) or Period 6 (if L=3); since it hasn't concluded by Period 7, and given we already confirmed Period 1's shipment was lost, there is a high risk that the supply chain is unstable or shipments are being lost. To protect against this, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the accelerating spring demand (avg ~215 for the review+lead window). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed for Spring Peak: Period 7 demand reached 285 (+50% vs Period 5). Supply chain instability continues: Period 3 order (294 units) is now 3 periods overdue and likely lost or significantly delayed.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product, 3p Sneaker Socks, is experiencing a sharp seasonal demand spike as spring progresses. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 273 units (214, 285, 320), representing a significant acceleration compared to the early spring mean of ~190. Supply chain reliability is a major concern: orders from Period 1 and Period 3 (totaling 433 units) are now confirmed or highly likely lost, as later orders should have arrived by now. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 962 units in-transit (P4: 266, P8: 263, and the likely lost P3: 294). Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the high stockout risk during this peak seasonality, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture the immediate demand trajectory (avg ~273). To account for the likely loss of the Period 3 shipment (294 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a higher base stock that prevents the engine from under-ordering due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Period 6-8 average demand is 273 units (+43% vs Period 2-5). Period 3 order (294 units) is officially considered lost as of Period 9 (6 periods elapsed since order).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is sneaker socks, which are in peak spring seasonality. We are currently facing a critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Two major shipments (Period 1 and Period 3) have been lost or indefinitely delayed, as confirmed by later orders (Period 2) arriving while they remain in-transit. The in-transit total of 962 includes these lost units (139 + 294 = 433 units), meaning only approximately 529 units are actually expected to arrive. Demand has shown a significantly higher regime since March (Period 4), with an average of approximately 228 units over the last 6 periods and a peak of 320. To recover from the stockout and account for the lost pipeline inventory which the OR engine still 'sees', I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised lead time which held for the only successful delivery) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate mu_hat as (1+L)*forecasted_demand. With L=2, (1+2)=3 periods. Using a conservative but seasonal mean of 240, mu_hat = 720. I will keep sigma_hat at a 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the high volatility seen during this spring peak.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

We are currently in Period 11 (2019/4/22). The SKU (Sneaker Socks) is in its spring peak, as confirmed by demand peaking at 320 in Period 8 and averaging ~236 over the last 5 periods. Demand appears to be stabilizing slightly from the extreme peak seen in late March/early April but remains significantly higher than the baseline. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods based on the arrival of the Period 8 order in Period 10 conclude. The Period 3 order (294 units) is confirmed lost, as it is 8 periods past its order date. Current on-hand is 54 and in-transit is 699 (representing the Period 4 order of 266, which is vastly overdue and likely lost, and the Period 8 order has already arrived). Because the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from the base stock calculation, and we have multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, and likely P4), we must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to 'over-order' and compensate for the vacuum left by these lost units. I set mu_hat to 1350 units (calculated as 3 * 250 avg demand + ~600 lost units documented in 'in-transit' that will never arrive) to ensure the system places an order this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 4 shipment (266 units) is now 7 periods past order date and is likely lost. Demand is stabilizing at a high 'Spring' plateau of ~230-250 units weekly.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand following a Period 11 stockout. Historically, demand has undergone a significant regime shift due to seasonality for 'sneaker socks' (Spring/Summer item). The baseline demand was ~114 units, peaking at 320 in Period 8, and has now settled into a 'Spring Plateau' averaging ~210-230 units (mean of Periods 9-11 is ~207, but includes stockout-restrained Period 11). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current high-demand environment (Periods 8-11 avg demand = 236), which ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient for the L+1 window. Regarding supply chain stability: orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 699 units) are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and are considered lost based on 'Carry-over Insights'. However, Period 8 arrived on time (L=2). To account for the risk of lost shipments without over-inflating holding costs if they suddenly arrive, I will use L=explicit with a value of 2 (trusting the recent successful delivery timing) but use a robust sigma_hat to handle the volatility. The target is to rebuild inventory to meet the 1-unit-per-4-unit profit margin service level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain risk update: Periods 1, 3, and 4 shipments (699 units total) are confirmed lost. Only Period 2 and Period 8 have successfully arrived, both with L=2. Demand plateau confirmed around 230 units/period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product (Sneaker Socks) is in a high-demand spring plateau. Looking at the history, shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (699 units) are effectively lost, as they are 8+ periods overdue despite a promised lead time of 2. Only Period 2 and Period 8 orders arrived, both with an actual lead time of 2. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) currently shows 1246 units, but 699 of these are likely 'ghost' units from the lost shipments. Effective in-transit is therefore approximately 547 units (the P11 order). On-hand is 0. Demand has averaged ~238 units over the last 5 weeks (P8-P12). To account for the lost shipments and ensure the OR engine doesn't incorrectly subtract 'ghost' pipeline units from the order calculation, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Since mu_hat = (1+L) * forecast, and L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 238 = 714. However, to compensate for the 699 'lost' units that the OR engine still thinks are in transit, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to force an order that bridges the gap. The OR engine calculates: Order = (mu_hat + z*sigma) - pipeline. To get an order that replenishment needs, I need to offset that 699 ghost stock. I will set mu_hat to 1413 (714 base + 699 offset) to ensure we maintain flow despite the accounting error caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline accounting correction required. Total lost units (P1, P3, P4) = 699. mu_hat inflated to 1413 to offset 'ghost' pipeline units and maintain real service level of ~238 units/period.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (May 13, 2019), we are managing '3p Sneaker Socks' during their spring seasonal peak. The environment is characterized by significant supply chain instability, with three shipments (Periods 1, 3, and 4) totaling 699 units confirmed lost. Only orders from Periods 2, 8, and 11 have arrived, all with an actual lead time (L) of 2. The Current In-transit (951 units) consists of the lost 699 units plus the Period 13 order (252 units). The OR backend's 'pipeline' logic includes these 699 lost units, which would normally prevent it from ordering enough to meet future demand. Demand has stabilized into a 'Spring Plateau' averaging ~239 units per period over the last 5 periods (P9-P13). At a 2-period lead time, base demand for (L+1) periods is ~717 units. To correct for the 699 'ghost' units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1416 (717 + 699) to ensure the backend places an order that maintains the desired service level despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline accounting update: L=2 remains the reliable lead time for successful arrivals. Total lost 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4) = 699. mu_hat requires a +699 unit offset to maintain a net base stock for 239 units/period demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has stabilized into a late-spring plateau, with the recent 4-week average (P11-P14) at 241 units. The operational lead time (L) remains 2 periods for successful deliveries. However, there is a significant 'ghost' pipeline issue: shipments from P1 (139), P3 (294), and P4 (266) are confirmed lost, totaling 699 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1157 units) from the base stock target, we must inflate the mu_hat parameter to prevent the system from under-ordering. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 units of demand) at ~240 units/period should be approximately 720 units + safety stock. With 108 units on hand and 458 units in valid transit (P13, P14), the OR engine needs to see a mu_hat that compensates for the 699 lost units. I will set mu_hat to 1420 (calculated as (1+L)*240 + 700) to effectively neutralize the lost 'ghost' units while maintaining the target inventory level for current demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline accounting: Total lost units (P1, P3, P4) = 699. Significant mu_hat inflation (approx +700) remains necessary to offset these 'ghost' units in the OR backend's calculation until they are either purged or we reach the end of the simulation.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are managing '3p Sneaker Socks'. Demand is in a high-demand spring plateau, with recent demand volumes being 301, 212, 227, 293, and 233 units over the last five periods. The average demand for this plateau is approximately 253 units per week. 

Supply chain reconciliation: The 'In-transit' figure is 1362 units. However, based on the history, 699 of these units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) are over 10 periods old and effectively lost. Only the orders from Period 13 (252 units), Period 14 (206 units), and Period 15 (205 units) are viable pipeline inventory (totaling 663 units). These viable orders are following the promised lead time of L=2.

The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - in_transit. With 'ghost' units inflating the in-transit value by 699, we must inflate the base_stock by the same amount to ensure a real order is triggered. 

Targeting a weekly demand of ~253 units for L=2 (L+1=3 periods of coverage): 
Expected Base Stock = (253 * 3) + safety stock (~1.28 * stdev * sqrt(3)). Assuming stdev \u2248 40, Base Stock \u2248 847.
Required mu_hat (inflated) = 847 + 699 = 1546. 
L remains 2 as successful shipments are arriving on time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 17 (June 3, 2019). We are in a high-demand plateau for sneaker socks. Recent demand (P11-P16) averages ~259 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline Accounting: There is a critical issue with 'ghost' units in the pipeline. Orders from P1 (139), P3 (294), and P4 (266) totaling 699 units are confirmed lost/undelivered but still count against the OR backend's 'In-transit' figure. Successful arrivals (P2, P8, P11) consistently show L=2. To compensate for the 699 units that the OR engine thinks are coming but actually aren't, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired Base Stock calculation: Demand for L+1 (3 periods) = 259 * 3 = 777. Since base_stock = mu_hat + (z*sigma), and the backend subtracts pipeline (1606 units) to determine the order, I need the calculated base_stock to be approximately 2305 (777 + 699 lost units + safety stock buffer) to ensure a meaningful order is placed. I will set mu_hat to 1475 (approx 777 + 699) to force the backend to place an order that covers current demand despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Confirmed high-demand plateau (P11-P16) average is 259 units. Ghost pipeline units total 699 (P1, P3, P4). mu_hat must remain inflated by ~700 units to offset these permanently lost shipments until the simulation ends or inventory records reset.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/6/10), demand for sneaker socks has entered a transition phase from the high Spring plateau (~260 units) toward summer levels. Period 17 demand dropped significantly to 98 units, though this may be a single-week outlier or the start of a seasonal decline. The pipeline inventory (1157 units) is heavily distorted by 699 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated 'in-transit' figure, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of actual demand PLUS the 699 lost units. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is 223 units. Therefore, the target base stock calculation is: ((1 + L) * 223) + 700. With L=2, this equals (3 * 223) + 700 = 1369. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to ensure this accounting correction is maintained until inventory records reset. L is set to calculate as recent successful deliveries (P8, P11, P15, P16) confirm a stable lead time of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Potential seasonal demand cooling observed (P17 demand 98 vs 5-week avg 223). Pipeline accounting correction remains at +700 units to offset lost shipments P1, P3, P4.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (2019/6/17), we are observing a significant deceleration in demand for sneaker socks. Demand has dropped from a Spring plateau of ~240 units to 98 units in Period 17 and 68 units in Period 18. This suggests that the seasonal peak has passed and we have entered a 'seasonal cooling' regime. The average demand for the last 2 periods is 83 units. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=2) to quickly adjust to this lower demand level, forecasting 83 units/period. The calculation for mu_hat is (1+L)*mean_demand. With L=2, this is 3 * 83 = 249. However, I must continue to account for the 'ghost' pipeline units (Periods 1, 3, and 4) which total 699 units. These units are in-transit in the system's eyes but will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and refusing to order, mu_hat must be inflated by 699 units. Total mu_hat = 249 + 699 = 948. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 2 periods of high volatility during this transition (Std Dev ~21, sqrt(3)*21 \u2248 36). L remains 'calculated' as arrival reliability (L=2) is consistent for successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand cooling confirmed: Period 17-18 average demand dropped to 83 units/period (-65% vs Spring peak). Ghost pipeline units (P1, P3, P4) remain at 699 units.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from the high Spring plateau (~240 units/period) to a significantly lower Summer regime. The last three periods (P17-P19) show demand of 98, 68, and 91, yielding a new average of 85.6 units/period. The pipeline inventory (1157 units) is heavily distorted by 'ghost' units from lost shipments P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 699 units), which the OR backend still believes are in-transit. To prevent the OR logic from halting all new orders due to this inflated pipeline, I must maintain an offset in mu_hat. However, because demand has dropped, the required base stock is now much lower. Estimated real demand for (L+1) periods = 3 * 86 = 258. To offset 699 ghost units and targeting a real base stock of ~258, I set mu_hat to 957 (258 + 699). Sigma_hat is set to 40 using recent_N=3 to reflect the lower volatility in this new regime. L=2 remains the standard lead time for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand cooling sustained: Period 17-19 average demand is 86 units/period, down from peak of ~240. Ghost pipeline units (P1, P3, P4) remain at 699.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a high spring plateau (avg ~240) into a lower summer regime. The most recent demand samples are 98, 68, 91, and 139 (average ~99 units). A significant operational challenge persists: three early shipments (Periods 1, 3, and 4) totaling 699 units are permanently lost, but remain in the 'in-transit' pipeline. Additionally, Period 14 (206 units) is now 7 periods old and should be considered lost, increasing the total 'ghost' pipeline to 905 units. With current on-hand inventory at 53 and a total pipeline reported as 1157, the 'real' active pipeline (excluding lost shipments) is only 252 units (Period 13). However, Period 13's 252 units are already 8 periods old and also likely lost. If we assume all units ordered before Period 17 are lost (P1, P2, P3, P4, P8, P11, P13, P14, P15, P16), the 'effective' pipeline is actually 0. The OR backend uses (base_stock - pipeline) to order. To ensure the backend places an order for the new demand level (L+1 = 3 periods, mean ~100/period), mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Units). Target base stock for current demand (service level ~0.8) should be approx 350-400. Adding 1157 ghost units leads to a mu_hat of approx 1500-1550 to force an order.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline accounting update Period 21: Total likely lost units in pipeline (all orders prior to Period 17) equal 1157 units. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is manually inflated to cover both future demand and the ghost inventory. Current demand regime stabilized at ~100 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442007' (sneaker socks) is transitioning from high Spring demand to a stabilized Summer regime. Recent demand (P17-P21) shows a distinct shift, averaging ~111 units/period, compared to the Spring peak of ~240 units. Inventory planning is severely complicated by a significant 'ghost' pipeline: Period 1, 3, 4, 11, 13, and 14 orders (totalling 1157 units) are chronically overdue and highly likely lost. The OR backend treats these 1157 units as incoming inventory ('In-transit'), which prevents new orders from being placed because the pipeline stock appears to exceed required coverage. To force the backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set to (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2 (the most reliable historical lead time), and a forecast of ~115 units/period for the current regime, the base demand component is (1+2)*115 = 345 units. Adding the 1157 lost units as an offset results in a mu_hat of 1502. This ensures the backend recognizes a deficit and orders to meet actual projected demand while ignoring the non-existent 'ghost' stock.

Carry-over insight: Stabilized Summer demand regime: average approx 115 units/period (P17-P21 average is 111). Total lost/ghost pipeline units identified as 1157 (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '3p Sneaker Socks' is currently in a stabilized summer demand regime. Recent demand (P21-P22) has shown an increase (160, 218) compared to the early summer lull (P17-P20 avg ~100), suggesting a new demand plateau or a mid-summer lift. The primary operational challenge remains the high number of 'ghost' units in the pipeline. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, and P14 (totaling 1,157 units) are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and are considered lost. These units currently occupy 'In-transit' space (Total In-transit: 1557), which prevents the OR backend from placing new orders (as it assumes we have enough stock coming). To force an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (1) the required base stock for future demand and (2) the volume of these ghost units. Current demand mean (P21-P22) is approx 189 units. Base stock for demand = (L+1) * 189 = 3 * 189 = 567. Adding the 1,157 ghost units yields a required mu_hat of ~1,724. I will set mu_hat to 1800 to ensure the backend generates an order that ignores the ghost pipeline and satisfies the current demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline accounting update Period 23: Ghost units (lost shipments) from P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14 total 1,157 units. These units must be offset by inflating mu_hat. Mid-summer demand lift detected: P21-P22 demand averaged 189 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has been volatile, showing a 'late summer' lift. Recent demand average (P21-P23) is 152.6 units. The most critical issue remains the massive pipeline inventory distortion: In-transit is 1487 units, but our actual successful arrivals (P2, P8, P11, P15, P16, P21, P22) confirm a reliable lead time of 1-2 periods. Historical analysis shows shipments from P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14 (totaling 1157 units) are lost 'ghost' units. To force the OR backend (which uses 'In-transit' in its base stock calculation) to place an order, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the genuine demand for the lead time cycle (3 periods including the review period) and the ghost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = (Expected Demand * 3) + Ghost Units = (153 * 3) + 1157 = 1616. Setting mu_hat to 1616 with L=2 effectively instructs the backend to maintain this stock level. sigma_hat is set to 150 to manage the volatility seen in the last 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand volatility confirmed: P21-P23 avg 153 units, with significant period-to-period swings (160 to 218 to 80). Ghost pipeline units remain at 1157 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/7/29), we remain in a Summer demand regime characterized by lower and more volatile demand (recent 3-period average is 113). The central challenge continues to be 'ghost pipeline inventory' from lost shipments. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, and P14 are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling approximately 1,157 units. These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (currently 1,487 units), which would normally prevent the OR engine from ordering since it believes the pipeline is overstuffed. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To calculate the needed value: target base stock = (Forecasted Demand \xd7 (L+1)) + Ghost units. With a current demand forecast of ~130 units/period and L=2, the base stock should be (130 * 3) + 1157 = 1547. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful net order to maintain our service level for the upcoming weeks. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Total lost 'ghost' units in pipeline remains at 1,157. Forecasted Summer demand has softened further (Period 24 demand = 40), requiring a reduction in target mu_hat to avoid overstocking while still offsetting ghost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $395.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context: Demand is in a lower 'Summer' regime compared to the Spring peak. The last 5 periods (P21-P25) have seen demand fluctuate significantly: 160, 218, 80, 40, 135 (average 126.6). However, the most recent two periods (40, 135) suggest continued volatility or softening. I will use recent_N (N=5) to calibrate mu_hat while accounting for the 'ghost' pipeline.

Pipeline Analysis: In-transit is 1487 units. Ghost units (lost shipments) from P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14 total 1,157 units based on historical non-arrival. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of approximately 330 units (from Period 23). 

OR Parameter Strategy: To ensure the OR backend (which subtracts the full 1487 in-transit from the base stock) actually places an order when needed, mu_hat must be inflated to: (Expected Demand for L+1 periods) + (Ghost Pipeline). 
Real Demand Forecast: avg 127/period * 3 periods (L=2) = 381 units.
Target mu_hat: 381 + 1157 = 1538 units.
L is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P21, P22) arrived with L=2 and L=1, respectively.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed Summer demand volatility (P21-P25 avg 127). Total lost 'ghost' units in pipeline remains 1,157 (Orders: P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/8/12), we are managing SKU 160442007 (sneaker socks). The historical lead time remains consistently around L=2, despite recent variability (P16 and P22 arrived in 1 period, P23 in 3). The primary challenge is the significant 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, and P14 (totaling 1,157 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. The OR backend includes these units in its 'in-transit' logic, preventing necessary new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to offset them. Current Summer demand is volatile but averages ~130 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P22-P26: 218, 80, 40, 135, 196). To ensure the backend places an order for the next cycle (L+1=3 weeks), we set mu_hat to cover the expected demand (~390 units) plus the 1,157 ghost units. Total mu_hat = 390 + 1157 = 1547. sigma_hat is set to roughly 200 to account for recent demand swings.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late August (2019/8/19), which typically shows a moderate demand regime for sneaker socks before the autumn transition. Recent demand (P26-P27) averaged 196 units/period, significantly higher than the early summer lows. The pipeline currently holds 1,437 units, but 1,157 of these are confirmed lost 'ghost' units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14). To trigger the OR backend to place orders despite these ghost units, mu_hat must be inflated. The goal is a net base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3 periods of coverage). Expected demand for 3 periods (~196 * 3) is 588. To offset the 1,157 ghost units, mu_hat is set to 588 + 1157 = 1745. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments have arrived in 2-3 periods, suggesting the backend should use its empirical average. Sigma_hat uses the last 5 periods to represent current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total lost 'ghost' units in pipeline remains 1,157 (Orders: P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14). Current demand regime (P26-P27) has stabilized at approximately 196 units/period, recovering from the mid-summer low.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), demand is stabilizing around 170-200 units per week (P26-P28 average is 189). The 'ghost' units in the pipeline remain the primary challenge for the OR engine. Historically confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 11, 13, and 14 total 1,157 units. These units are still counted as 'In-transit' (total 1,765), but will likely never arrive. To trigger the base-stock policy to order, mu_hat must be set to cover the (L+1) demand PLUS the ghost inventory. Projected demand for L=2 is roughly 190 units/period (570 for L+1). Adding 1,157 ghost units suggests a target mu_hat of approximately 1,727. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat at 1,730 and sigma at 100 to maintain a high service level amidst supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline accounting update. Total confirmed 'ghost' pipeline units (lost orders P1-P14) remains 1,157. Current demand regime (P26-P28) stable at ~189 units/period.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), the product ('3p Sneaker Socks') is experiencing a transition from summer demand into the early autumn period. The last three periods (P27-P29) show stable demand averaging approximately 173 units/period (197, 173, 150), indicating a slight cooling from the late-August peak of ~196 units. The critical bottleneck remains 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Total confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14) equal 1,157 units. These units are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders to meet a target base stock of 3 * 173 \u2248 519 units, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these ghost units. Specifically, mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory (1157). I will set mu_hat to 1,676 (approx 3 * 173 + 1157) using the explicit method to ensure the OR engine triggers an order. L is set to calculated as recent history shows arrivals between 1-3 periods, with 2 being the norm.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Autumn transition demand regime identified at ~170 units/period (P27-P29 average 173). Ghost pipeline inventory remains 1,157 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019), the product is transitioning into Autumn. Observed demand over the last four periods (P27-P30) has stabilized at an average of 173 units/period (197, 173, 150, 172). Consequently, I am setting the base demand forecast to 173 units/period. The pipeline inventory accounting remains the most critical issue: total 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14) remain at 1,157. These lost units represent 'inventory' that the OR backend thinks we have, which prevents new orders from being triggered. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat to approximately 1,676. This value is derived from the requirement to cover 3 periods of demand (L=2, so 1+L=3) at 173 units/period (519 units) plus the 1,157 ghost units (519 + 1,157 = 1,676). This inflation ensures that the OR backend sees a net target that accounts for the physical stock needed. I am keeping L=2 as the 'default' promised lead time, as recent successful deliveries (P27, P28) arrived in 2-3 periods, suggesting the core supply chain is functioning despite past losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Autumn demand regime stabilized at ~173 units/period (P27-P30). Total lost/ghost pipeline units remains 1,157. mu_hat must be inflated by this amount (~1,157) to trigger necessary orders.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 160442007 (Sneaker Socks) is currently in an Autumn demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) has averaged ~185 units/period (197, 173, 150, 172, 231). Pipeline accounting remains the primary challenge: there is a total of 1,157 'ghost' units in the in-transit inventory from lost shipments (Periods 1, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14). Specifically, current 'In-transit' is 1,277, which consists of the 1,157 ghost units plus the active orders from P29 (50) and P31 (62) and P26 (8? No, P26 order was 8, P27 was 272-arrived, P28 was 328-arrived). Actually, In-transit 1277 = 1157 (ghost) + 50 (P29) + 8 (P26 - not yet arrived) + 62 (P31). The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)'. To ensure the backend actually places an order to cover the current demand (approx 185 units/period), the mu_hat must be inflated to offset the 1,157 ghost units. Targeted base stock for the (L+1)=3 periods of coverage is (3 * 185) + safety stock (~150) = 705. To force the backend to see this need despite the 1,157 ghost units and 197 on-hand, we need a mu_hat approximately equal to (705 + 1157) = 1862. I will set mu_hat to 1865 using 'explicit' and L to 'default' (2).

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total ghost pipeline inventory verified at 1,157 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14). Autumn demand stable at ~185 units/period.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a stabilized Autumn demand regime. The average demand for the last five periods (P28-P32) is approximately 187 units (173, 150, 172, 231, 210). Based on recent history, lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a calculation-based approach for 'L' is appropriate. The pipeline currently contains 1,651 units. However, my 'Carry-over Insights' track 1,157 units from several early periods (P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14) that are confirmed or effectively lost (the 'ghost pipeline'). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1,651) from the base stock target, it believes we have significantly more inventory than is actually arriving. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of real demand (approx 3 * 187 = 561) plus the ghost units (1,157). Total mu_hat = 1,718. This manual inflation ensures the net order (base stock - pipeline) reflects actual consumer needs.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand surged to 369 units, significantly higher than the previous Autumn plateau of ~185. This suggests a seasonal shift as we enter October (Late Autumn/Pre-Winter). Pipeline accounting remains the primary challenge: total 'ghost' units (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14) equal 1,157. These units are visible in the 'In-transit' count (1,717 total) but will never arrive. The OR backend's inventory calculation (On-Hand + In-Transit) perceives 1,717 in pipeline, which far exceeds the required base stock for the current demand regime, causing it to stop ordering. I must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset these 1,157 ghost units. Based on the recent surge, I estimate the new demand regime at ~280 units/period. The target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) would be 280 * 3 = 840. Adding the 1,157 ghost offset, the required mu_hat is approximately 1,997. I will use the explicit method to ensure the order is triggered despite the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand surge detected (P33: 369 units). Transitioning forecast from Autumn plateau (~185) to Late Autumn/Winter regime estimated at ~280 units/period. Pipeline accounting for 1,157 lost units remains critical.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35 (2019/10/07), we are entering the Late Autumn/Winter demand regime. Demand surged to 369 in Period 33 and remained high at 249 in Period 34 (avg ~309). This is significantly higher than the Autumn plateau of ~185. We adjust our forecast (mu_hat) to a base of 280 units/period. Crucially, the pipeline remains heavily contaminated with 'ghost' units. Confirmed lost shipments include P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, and P14, totaling 1,157 units. Additionally, P15, P16, P23, P27, P28, and P31 have concluded, but substantial portions of the In-transit balance (2123 units) are comprised of these historical lost orders. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the 'In-transit' figure being higher than actual physical arrivals, we must inflate mu_hat. Total Target = (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Offset. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 280) + 1157 = 1997. Sigma is set based on recent volatility, which has increased with the volume surge.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn/Winter demand shift confirmed: P33-P34 average demand is 309 units/period. Ghost pipeline inventory (lost orders P1-P14) remains steady at 1,157 units, necessitating continued mu_hat inflation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019). We entered a Late Autumn/Winter demand regime in Period 33. Demand in P33-P35 was 369, 249, and 185 respectively. The average of these three periods is 267.7. Ghost units (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14) total 1,157 units, which erroneously inflate the OR backend's pipeline inventory, preventing needed orders. 

Strategy: 
1. Lead Time: Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P32 arrived in P35, L=3). I will retain L=2 (promised) but monitor for further delays.
2. Demand (mu_hat): I estimate future demand at ~250 units/period (mean of the last 3 periods is ~268, but cooling slightly). To ensure the OR backend orders, I must satisfy: base_stock = Pipeline + mu_hat_input. My target base stock for L=2 is 3 periods * 250 units = 750 units. The 'ghost' pipeline is 1,157 units. Actual On-hand is 251. To force any order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the ghost pipeline relative to the actual replenishment need.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Winter demand regime identified. P33-P35 avg demand is ~268 units. Ghost pipeline units (lost orders P1-P14) remain at 1,157. mu_hat requires continued massive inflation to bypass these ghost units in OR calculations.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P33-P36) reflects a winter-entry regime with an average of 237 units, though P36 showed a dip to 145. Significant pipeline accounting is required: In-transit is 1687 units, but the persistent 'ghost' units (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14) total 1,157. These units are visible to the OR engine but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders despite this 1,157-unit 'inflated' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. Calculation: Target base stock for L=2 is (L+1) * forecast + safety stock. Forecast is ~235 units/period. Target = 3 * 235 + approx 250 (safety) = 955. Adding the 1,157 ghost offset, the required mu_hat is set to 2112. This ensures the engine's calculation (mu_hat - pipeline) generates an order roughly equal to the period's expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost pipeline inventory remains 1,157 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14). Winter demand regime is showing volatility with a 4-period average of ~237 units, but a recent dip to 145 (P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the product (3p Sneaker Socks) is in a volatile Winter transition phase. Recent demand (P33-P37) shows wide swings with an average of 228 units/period. The pipeline accounting remains the primary challenge: total lost/ghost inventory from historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14) totals 1,157 units. These units appear in the OR backend's pipeline inventory but will never arrive, effectively blocking new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to bypass them. To calculate the necessary mu_hat: a real desired base stock for 3 periods (L+1) at ~230 units/period with safety stock is roughly 900-1000 units. To achieve an order from the backend when 'ghost' in-transit is 1,157, we must set mu_hat significantly above that ghost level. I will set mu_hat to 1,840 (approx 230 * 8) to ensure the backend sees a gap and places an order to cover upcoming demand, while setting L consistently at calculated (actual avg is ~2.3).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Ghost pipeline units remain 1,157. Winter transition demand average is ~228 units/period (P33-P37). Continued mu_hat inflation required to maintain actual on-hand availability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status: 197 on-hand. In-transit inventory is 1,687 units, of which 1,157 are confirmed lost 'ghost' units from periods prior to P14 (P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14). Real pipeline is approximately 530 units (1,687 - 1,157). The OR backend sees the full 1,687 in-transit and will not order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for the 1,157 lost units. Recent demand (P34-P38) has settled into a late Autumn regime averaging 190 units/period (249, 185, 145, 191, 181). To maintain a safe base stock covering 3 periods (L+1=3) at ~190 units/period while bypassing the ghost inventory of 1,157, the target mu_hat needs to be approximately 1,727 (3 * 190 + 1,157). I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to ensure this precise offset. L is set to calculate as actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods recently. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current weekly variance of the 190-unit regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand context: Demand has cooled significantly over the last three periods (191, 181, 104) ending in early November. This suggests the high-demand Winter regime (avg ~237) is tapering off as we move further into the season. I will use a 3-period average (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to capture this immediate cooling trend, which averages ~159 units/period. Pipeline accounting: The total 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14) total 1157 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (1621), blocking the OR backend's order logic. To trigger an order for a 2-period lead time environment with a demand of ~159/period (base stock target ~477), mu_hat must be inflated. Target base stock = 477. Explicit mu_hat = Target base stock + Ghost units = 477 + 1157 = 1634. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals show a mix of 1 and 3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand cooling trend confirmed (P37-P39 avg 159). Ghost pipeline inventory (lost orders P1-P14) remains at 1,157 units, requiring mu_hat inflation of ~1,157 to offset the error in the OR controller's inventory position.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' has stabilized in a mid-level autumn/winter regime. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 148 units, significantly lower than the late autumn peak of ~300. In-transit inventory is currently 1,621 units. Based on historical data, 1,157 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, and P14) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from the target base stock. To ensure an order is actually placed when needed, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Units. With L=2 and a forecast of ~135 units/period (reflecting the recent cooling trend), the base demand component is ~405. Adding the 1,157 ghost units results in a mu_hat of ~1,562. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma to capture recent volatility while using an explicit mu_hat to handle the pipeline accounting error.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand cooling trend sustained (P37-P40 avg 149). Ghost pipeline inventory remains 1,157 units. Target mu_hat must include a 1,157 unit offset to bypass backend inventory logic errors.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 160442007 (sneaker socks) continues its late-autumn cooling trend. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is approximately 140 units/period, down from the winter transition peak of ~240. Pipeline inventory is significantly distorted by 'ghost' units. A review of history confirms orders from P1 (139), P3 (294), P4 (266), P11 (547), P13 (252), and P14 (206) never arrived or were lost, while more recent orders (P33, P36, P37) have concluded. However, the in-transit field currently shows 1621 units. Since P41 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and recent demand is ~140, we must ensure an order is triggered. To bypass the 1621 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory (approx 1621 - actual valid in-transit). There are currently no valid in-transit units from recent periods (P38-P41 had 0 orders). Thus, to trigger an order of approximately 420 units (3 periods of 140 demand), mu_hat is set to 2041 (1621 ghost + 420 target). This ensures the OR backend logic [base_stock - pipeline] results in a positive order despite the historical data noise.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total ghost pipeline inventory identified as 1,621 units (accumulated lost orders through P34). Current demand regime (P37-P41) stabilized at ~140 units/period. mu_hat requires inflation of ~1,621 units to trigger replenishment.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 begins with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 2,103 units. Historical analysis confirms that a significant portion of the pipeline is comprised of 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments). As of Period 42, the accumulated ghost units from orders P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, and potentially P34 (which is 9 periods old) total 1,621 units. The remaining 482 units in transit are from the Period 42 order. Demand in Period 42 saw a significant 1-week spike to 311, though the preceding 5-period average (P37-P41) was much lower (~140). I am adopting a cautious forecast of ~220 units per period to account for potential early December/Late Autumn volatility. To bypass the backend's logic which counts the 1,621 ghost units as available inventory, I must set mu_hat to (1+L) * Demand + Ghost Units. With L=2, this equals (3 * 220) + 1621 = 2281. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the true stock-out and places a replenishment order. sigma_hat is set relatively high (explicit=150) to manage the recent demand spike and erratic lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost pipeline inventory is updated to 1,621 units (including P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, and now effectively P34). Demand is exhibiting high volatility in the late-year transition (P42 spike to 311).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' is currently in a high-volatility late-year phase. Recent demand (P42: 311, P43: 107) shows significant fluctuations, averaging approximately 144 units over the last 5 periods (P39-P43). We are in Period 44 of 47, meaning only 4 decision periods remain (44, 45, 46, 47). The critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory\u2014specifically units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, P34) which have not arrived and are essentially lost. Total 'in-transit' is 2408, while actual reliable pipeline units (P42=482, P43=305) total only 787. This leaves 1621 'ghost' units. To force the OR backend to order for the upcoming periods, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the expected demand (approx 150 units/period * (L+1)) and the 1621 ghost units. L=2 remains the promised benchmark. Using mu_hat = (150 * 3) + 1621 = 2071. Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility levels to ensure a buffer against the high demand spikes seen in late year.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost pipeline inventory remains 1,621 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, P34). Demand remains volatile with late-year spikes (e.g., P42=311), but recent 5-period mean is ~144 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (2019/12/16), the system is facing a massive pipeline distortion. Total 'In-transit' inventory is 2,408 units, but our on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of history confirms that many orders are lost or indefinitely delayed: P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, P34, and now potentially P42 (ordered P42, lead time 2 means it should have arrived in P44 resolution). Total 'ghost' units (lost/overdue) are estimated at ~1,926 units (Orders 1, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14, 34, 42). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from the base stock, it will not place new orders despite zero on-hand availability unless mu_hat is massively inflated. Current demand has cooled significantly in December (P43-P44 average = 97.5). To trigger a replenishment that covers ~3 periods of demand (L+1) while bypassing 1,926 ghost units, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 2,250 (1,926 ghost + 324 real demand forecast). L is set to explicit 2 as it remains the most common lead time for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Estimated ghost pipeline inventory increased to ~1,926 units due to P42 (482 units) failing to arrive by P45 start. Current real demand regime for December is ~100 units/period.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are transitioning through late December. On-hand inventory is healthy at 684 units following the arrival of orders from Period 42 and 43. Current demand has stabilized at a lower winter level; the average demand for the last five periods (P41-P45) is 143 units, while the very recent 3-period average (P43-P45) is approximately 100 units. The 'ghost' pipeline units (orders P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, and P34) are permanently lost and total 1,621 units. However, because our current on-hand inventory (684) is significantly higher than the expected 2-period demand (~200-300 units), the OR backend will not place an order regardless of the ghost inventory until on-hand levels drop. I will set mu_hat to 1,921 (current demand forecast for three periods ~300 + 1,621 ghost offset) and L to default (2). This ensures that once the on-hand inventory is depleted, the backend will correctly trigger replenishment by bypassing the ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost pipeline inventory confirmed at 1,621 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, P34). Demand regime is in a seasonal winter low, averaging ~100-140 units/period.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 30, 2019, representing the year-end/holiday period for women's sneaker socks. The demand regime has effectively stabilized at a seasonal low, with a 5-period average (P42-P46) of approximately 150 units/period, excluding the volatile P42 spike which likely represents a pre-Christmas surge. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 545 units following the arrival of P42 and P43 orders. The critical issue remains the 'in-transit' logic: there are 1,621 units in the pipeline that are confirmed lost (Orders P1, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, and P34). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' inventory from the base stock calculation, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is inflated by the sum of expected demand and these ghost units. Even though we have 545 units on hand, to ensure the backend is prepared for any 2020 recovery demand, I am setting mu_hat at 2,071 (Expected Demand for L+1 periods @ 150/period = 450 units, plus the 1,621 ghost unit offset). Sigma_hat is set to reflect the moderate volatility (standard deviation ~85) observed in the recent winter weeks.
