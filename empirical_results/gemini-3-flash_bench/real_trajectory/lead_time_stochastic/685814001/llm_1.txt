Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a significant uptrend: 61 -> 41 -> 106 -> 145 -> 133. The average over the last four weeks is ~106 units. Historically, early spring can still see strong hoodie demand, though it may taper as weather warms. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). d) Inventory: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. e) Order Logic: Estimated demand for P1-P3 is approx 130 per period based on the recent peak. 130 * 3 = 390 units. I will order 400 units to establish initial inventory and cover the pipeline while demand is high.",

Period 1 observed demand was 91. The historical average is roughly 96 units/period. c) Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2 periods.

Even with a lead time of 2, the order arrives during P3 demand resolution. d) Inventory: Current on-hand is 0. Demand in P1 was 91, which went unfulfilled (sold=0) because of 0 initial stock. Total in-transit is 400. e) Order Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 to maintain stock, as an order placed now (P2) will not arrive until Period 4 (P2 + 2 = P4). Expected demand for P2-P4 is ~300 units (3 * 100). The current in-transit (400) covers this plus a safety buffer. However, since I am currently stocked out and lost 91 units of sales in P1, I will place a moderate order to account for the P1 stockout and ensure I don't run dry if demand spikes again towards the 140+ range seen in late January.",

Recent periods show high volatility (79 to 151). c) Promised lead time is 2. Periodic conclude messages: P1 (Arrived 0), P2 (Arrived 0), P3 (Arrived 0). Based on the execution sequence, the P1 order (400 units) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible at the start of P4. However, the 'Current Status' for P4 shows On-hand: 0 and In-transit: 600. This implies the 400 units from P1 haven't cleared 'In-transit' yet, or the 'Current Status' snapshot is taken before the P3 'conclude' message is fully reconciled with the P4 decision phase on-hand. Since Promised Lead Time = 2, Order P1 (place P1, arrive P3) should be on-hand now. If on-hand is 0, it suggests a delay or that lead-time is at least 3. d) Pipeline: 400 (P1), 100 (P2), 100 (P3) = 600. Target inventory for (L+1) = 3 periods at ~110/period = 330. e) Current in-transit (600) significantly exceeds the projected 3-period demand (330).

As we move deeper into March and April, we might see a slight seasonal tapering, but keeping a target of ~100 units/week is safe. Inventory status: On-hand is 86. In-transit consists of 650 units.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 111. Total in-transit is 550, which includes 500 units from older, presumed lost/highly delayed shipments (P1: 400, P3: 100) and a fresh 50-unit order from P13. Given the Lead Time (L) of 2, we must cover P14, P15, and P16 demand. Assuming a base demand of ~50-60 units/week with buffer for spikes, we need ~180 units. The current on-hand (111) plus the reliable in-transit order from P13 (50) provides 161 units. Although the P1/P3 orders are likely lost, ordering too much risked high holding costs if they suddenly arrived. I will place a small order of 50 units to maintain a steady pipeline and cover the gap to the 180-200 unit target while monitoring the P13 shipment arrival.",

We expect demand to remain strong through late December and possibly early January due to winter sales, though it may begin to taper off in late January. Inventory management remains complicated by the ~50% shipment loss rate. Currently, there are 1075 units on-hand.
