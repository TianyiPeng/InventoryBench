The 'Jessy Jersey Skirt' is a staple item in the 'Divided' collection (targeting younger demographics).

Starting Feb 25, we are entering the spring season where demand for short skirts typically increases. History shows a clear upward trend: 71, 79, 82, 90, 80 (pre-game history), followed by 97 (P1) and 171 (P2). The jump to 171 in P2 is a significant signal of seasonal ramp-up. 2. Lead Time & Inventory: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from P1 (92 units) and P2 (99 units) are in-transit (Total 191). The P1 order is expected to arrive during P3. Currently, on-hand is 0, meaning we have missed demand in P1 and P2. 3. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 147 units based on historical averages. However, it likely underestimates the recent shift to a higher demand regime (171 in P2). 4. Strategy: Total pipeline (including this order) must cover demand for the lead time plus the arrival period (L+1 = 3 periods). If we assume demand remains high (~170/period), we need ~510 units in the system. Current pipeline is 191. 510 - 191 = 319.

It should arrive during Period 3 (Feb 25) and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or shipments are delayed/lost. \n2. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 491 units (P1: 92, P2: 99, P3: 300). Demand in Period 1-3 was 97, 171, and 105 respectively. Total demand (373) significantly exceeded the historical average (~80). \n3. **Product/Seasonality**: The product is a 'Short skater skirt' in the 'Divided' collection. As it is March 4th, we are entering the Spring season, which explains the demand surge compared to January. \n4. **OR Analysis**: OR recommends 0 because the pipeline (491) exceeds the calculated base-stock level derived from January's lower demand samples. However, OR is not accounting for the seasonal demand shift or the lead-time delay. \n5. **Strategy**: Since on-hand is 0 and we have a major stockout (sold=0 for 3 periods), we are desperate for stock. The pipeline of 491 units is large, but until it arrives, we are losing sales. However, if I order more now, I risk a massive inventory glut once the pipeline finally clears, especially with $1 holding cost vs $4 profit. Given the pipeline is already 491 units and the average demand is ~125 recently, the pipeline covers ~4 periods once it arrives. I will place a small order of 100 units to buffer against continued high demand and the risk that earlier shipments (P1/P2) might be lost, while avoiding massive overstocking if the pipeline arrives all at once.",

Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees a large pipeline (492) relative to current inventory.

The total in-transit is 692, but given the carry-over insights and history, the reliability of the P3 and P4 orders (totaling 400 units) is extremely low. 2. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized around 70 units per period (P4-P7 average = 70.75). With Spring (April) progressing, demand is expected to remain steady or slightly increase. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Effective pipeline is highly uncertain. If we assume P3 and P4 are lost, the reliable pipeline is only 292 units (P6: 100, P7: 100, P8: 92ish?

P10 was ordered in Period 10 with a promised lead time of 2 (expected arrival Period 12 conclude/Period 13 start), yet Period 12 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the current actual lead time has slipped again or the shipment is delayed. 2. **Inventory Reality**: On-hand inventory is 27. Real pipeline = 717 (reported) - 425 (lost) = 292 units.

Recent demand (P13: 64, P14: 49, P15: 45) suggests a stabilization around 45-50 units per period. World knowledge of the 'Short skater skirt' and late May date (2019/5/27) suggests we are moving past the peak season.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Expected arrivals in P16/P17 are the orders from P13 (75) and P14 (125). Even with ghost units removed, we have 250 units in the pipeline to cover approximately 150 units of demand over the next 3 periods (L+1). \n4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR recommend 0 because it sees the inflated 'In-transit' (867). Even after correcting for 617 ghost units, the remaining 250 is sufficient. Ordering more now would likely lead to high holding costs as demand continues to taper off headed into summer.",

Subtracting these 'ghost' units leaves an effective pipeline of 85 units (1202 - 1117). This effective pipeline comes from the Period 23 order (160 units placed, but Period 23 conclude showed 160 arrived from Period 22, implying the Period 23 order is still in transit). \n2. **Inventory Positioning**: Current On-hand is 275 units. Effective Pipeline is 85 units (remaining from Period 23). Total Effective Stock is 360 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 5 periods is ~106 units (162, 111, 91, 84, and the pre-history samples). While there was a peak in late June, the last two weeks (91, 84) show stabilization. Total Effective Stock of 360 units covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand at the 106-unit rate.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees the massive (but fake) in-transit total. By calculating reality, we see we have enough stock (360 units) to cover the lead time (avg 2 periods) plus safety stock. However, given the extreme unreliability of this supplier, I will place a maintenance order to ensure we don't stock out if the next shipment is lost, following the recent demand trend of ~80-100 units.",

Therefore, the actual reliable in-transit pipeline consists only of orders from Period 24 (100 units) and Period 25 (100 units), totaling 200 units. Demand Analysis: Demand has softened as we move into August (P25: 75, P26: 53), consistent with the end of the summer season for a 'short skater skirt'. Lead Time Inference: The Period 23 order arrived in 3 periods (P26 conclude), suggesting lead times have stretched to 3 periods. Strategy: Total effective stock (On-hand 178 + Valid In-transit 200) = 378 units. With late-summer demand averaging approximately 65-75 units per period, 378 units covers over 5 periods of demand.

The only valid in-transit order is from Period 32 (125 units), which already arrived in Period 32. Thus, the actual pipeline is 0. Demand Analysis: While September demand was averaging ~60, the spike to 120 in Period 33 suggests a potential end-of-month or promotional surge. Lead-time Inference: Recent arrivals (P31 arriving in P32) show a lead time of 1 period, though the promised lead time is 2. To cover demand over the 2-period lead-time horizon (P34, P35, P36), and considering the recent surge, I need to restock.
