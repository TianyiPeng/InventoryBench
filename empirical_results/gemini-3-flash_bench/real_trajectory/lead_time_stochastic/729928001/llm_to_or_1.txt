Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 for the 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT'. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show values of 71, 79, 82, 90, and 80. The mean of these 5 samples is 80.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 6.27. As we are moving into mid-February, there is no immediate strong seasonal signal (like a holiday or peak summer) for a jersey skirt in this 'Divided' collection, so I will rely on recent historical averages. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand for the review period (1) plus the lead time (2), we need to account for 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering all available history) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the observed volatility. For lead time, I will use the 'default' promised value of 2 as there is no performance history yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 97 units for the JESSY JERSEY SKIRT, which exceeded our preliminary historical mean (~80). As we are at the start of the spring season (mid-February), demand for skirts is likely to rise. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 92 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect the Period 1 order to arrive during Period 3 (visible in P4). For Period 2, I will set mu_hat using a slightly more aggressive recent window to account for the jump to 97, and keep L at default (2) as we have no evidence yet of lead time deviation. The goal is to build inventory to meet this higher demand baseline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) managing 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT'. Historical demand from Jan-Feb averaged 80.4. However, Period 1 saw 97 and Period 2 saw 171. This spike correlates with the transition into late February/early March, indicating early Spring seasonality/Back-to-School-like demand for the 'Divided' collection (targeting younger customers). Current on-hand is 0, with 196 units in transit (92 from P1, 104 from P2). Promised lead time (L) is 2. The P1 order should arrive during P3 and be visible in P4 conclude. The P2 order should arrive during P4. Demand is sharply increasing (171 is ~2.1x the Jan average); I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture this surge for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend sets a higher base stock to recover from current stockouts and meet the rising trend.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 2 (171 vs 80.4 average); likely early Spring seasonal shift for the Divided Skirt category.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' is experiencing a significant demand surge (171 and 105 in the last two periods compared to the ~80 baseline), likely due to early spring seasonality for skirts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had lost sales for 3 consecutive periods because total arrival is 0. However, the promised lead time is 2. The Period 1 order (92 units) should have arrived in Period 3 (visible now in the Period 3 conclude message). Since 'arrived=0' is reported for P3, the P1 shipment is either delayed or lost. Total in-transit is 417 units (92+104+221). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay/instability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the surge (97, 171, 105) while smoothing the extreme P2 peak. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility in this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Inbound delay/loss detected: Period 1 order (92 units) failed to arrive by Period 3 conclude (promised L=2). Supply chain instability suspected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $261.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019/3/11), we see the inventory finally starting to circulate. We successfully fulfilled 73 units of demand in Period 4 after receiving the Period 2 order (104 units). Crucially, the Period 1 order (92 units) is officially confirmed as lost, as the Period 4 conclude message showed the Period 2 order arriving with L=2, while the Period 1 order is absent. The demand history shows a massive spike in P2 (171) followed by a return to more moderate levels (105, 73). Averaging the last 3 periods (171, 105, 73) gives ~116 units/period, which is higher than the initial pre-game average of 80. Given the product is a short skater skirt, we expect demand to remain higher than winter levels as Spring progresses. L is set to 'calculate' to use the confirmed L=2 benchmark. mu_hat and sigma_hat use N=3 to capture the post-winter regime while smoothing out the extreme P2 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Period 1 order (92 units) confirmed lost (P2 order arrived while P1 did not). Net pipeline adjusted.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Short skater skirt', which typically sees a seasonal rise in Spring. Demand analysis: Samples 1-5 showed a mean of 80.4. Since Period 2, demand has been erratic (171, 105, 73, 72). While the initial surge was high, the last two periods (73, 72) suggest a stabilization or a slight decline from that peak, but still significantly above pre-Period 2 levels if considering the total volume. Supply check: Period 1's order (92 units) is confirmed lost. Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (L=2). Period 3's order (221) should have arrived in Period 5 conclude but didn't; however, it is likely delayed by 1 period rather than lost yet, as Period 1 was the only confirmed loss. Pipeline currently holds P3 (221), P4 (149), and P5 (0) orders. Inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts. To recover and cover the 3-period risk window (L+1), I will set mu_hat based on the recent regime (P2-P5 avg = 105.25). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the high volatility seen in the last 4 weeks.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Supply chain instability persists; Period 3 order (221 units) delayed beyond promised L=2 visibility. Demand stabilizing at higher level (avg ~105) compared to Jan/early Feb.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/03/25). The SKU (Short skater skirt) is in high demand, but we have experienced significant supply chain issues. Arrival History: Period 2 order (104 units) arrived in Period 4 (L=2). The Period 1 order (92 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 3 order (221 units) was placed in P3, and with a promised lead time of 2, it should have arrived in Period 5 and been visible in the P6 conclude message. It is now Period 7 and it is still missing from the conclude history, signaling a likely delay or loss. Demand Analysis: Initial samples averaged ~80. After a spike in Period 2 (171), demand has stabilized over the last three periods (P4: 73, P5: 72, P6: 67) for an average of approximately 71. However, since we have been out of stock for the last two periods, true demand might be slightly higher than observed sales, though the 'demand' field tracks unmet needs. Combining the recent stability with early volatility, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the shift away from the P2 spike. For lead time, I will set L to 3 explicitly to account for the observed delays in the supply chain and protect against the risk of the OR backend under-ordering due to the high in-transit count (462 units, which includes the potentially lost/delayed P3 and P4 orders).

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Supply chain delay confirmed; Period 3 order (221 units) is now 2 periods overdue beyond promised lead-time visibility. Average demand has stabilized around 70-75 units post-February spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 729928001 (Jersey Skirt) is experiencing significant supply chain disruptions. The Period 3 order (221 units) remains missing after 4 periods of visibility delay, and the Period 4 order (149 units) is also overdue. Despite these delays, demand has stabilized from the February peak (~171 units) to a consistent regime of approximately 71 units per week over the last four periods (P4-P7: 73, 72, 67, 71). Current on-hand inventory is 0. With 464 units in-transit (Period 3, 4, and 7 orders), the OR-backend would normally see a massive pipeline and potentially zero out new orders. However, given the high likelihood of lost or significantly delayed shipments (P3 and P4 orders), I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand window while assuming the actual lead time is likely higher than the promised 2. I'll use 3 for L (based on recent instability) and a mu_hat reflecting the stabilized demand of ~71 units/period across the (3+1) window, plus a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed: Period 4-7 demand average is 70.75 units (std dev ~2.5), down from Feb peaks. Persistent inbound delay: Orders from P3 and P4 are currently 2-3 periods overdue beyond promised lead-time visibility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019/04/08), the SKU remains in an out-of-stock state with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of history confirms extreme supply chain instability: Period 1 was lost, Period 3 (221 units) and Period 4 (149 units) are significantly overdue (5 and 4 periods since order, respectively, vs. promised L=2). However, Period 7 arrived in just 1 period. Demand has spiked again to 139 units in Period 8, likely due to early April/Spring seasonality for the 'Short skater skirt'. The recent demand average (P4-P8) is approximately 84.4 units, but P8's 139 suggests a new high-demand regime. Given the unreliable pipeline (462 units in-transit are likely stuck/lost or will arrive in a clump), I will use 'explicit' L=3 to account for the frequent delays and set mu_hat to cover the expected seasonal demand spike (approx 100/week) over the next 4 periods (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: 139 units suggests high volatility/spring seasonality (avg increased from ~71 to 139). Significant supply chain bifurcation: P7 arrived in L=1, while P3 and P4 remain missing (5+ periods), suggesting potential 'batching' or systematic failure for larger orders.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'JESSY JERSEY SKIRT' is currently in a high-demand spring season (April). Recent demand surged to 139 in P8 before dropping to 64 in P9, echoing the volatility seen in February. The supply chain is highly unstable: Orders from Period 1 (92), Period 3 (221), and Period 4 (149) are severely overdue (6+ periods), while a Period 7 order arrived in just 1 period. This suggests that the large 'pipeline' of 462 units is likely lost or permanently stalled, as on-hand inventory remains at 0 and customer demand is being lost. To trigger new orders from the OR backend (which subtracts pipeline from base_stock), I am explicitly setting lead time to 5 to account for the actual delays and using an explicit mu_hat based on the current April demand profile (avg ~101 over the last two weeks). This target level (approx 600 units) will exceed the ghost pipeline and allow for replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: Large orders (P1, P3, P4 totaling 462 units) are >5 periods overdue and likely lost/stalled, while small orders (P7) arrive in 1 period. Demand regime remains volatile (avg ~100) reflecting Spring seasonality.

In-transit inventory stands at 616 units, however, history shows that large orders from Period 1 (92 units), Period 3 (221 units), and Period 4 (149 units) are significantly past their promised lead time (L=2) and have likely been lost or stalled. Conversely, smaller orders like the one from Period 7 arrived very quickly (L=1). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand has exhibited a 'spring hump' pattern: after a spike to 139 in Period 8, it has retreated to 64 and 72 in the last two periods. To avoid over-ordering into a potentially broken pipeline while still responding to recent demand levels, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (average ~91.6 units per interval including lead time). I am resetting L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed L=1 and L=2 arrivals into the OR logic, and using recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility seen in the spring data.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is facing a chronic stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of history confirms a fractured supply chain: small orders (P2, P7) arrive with a lead time of 1-2 periods, while large orders (P1, P3, P4) totaling 462 units are now 7-10 periods overdue and must be considered permanently lost. The current 'In-transit' of 616 includes 154 units from Period 10 (promised L=2), which should have arrived during Period 12 resolution but haven't been 'concluded' yet. The recent demand (P9-P11) has stabilized around an average of 72 units. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes the 462 lost units, it will refuse to place new orders unless I lower L or mu_hat, or if I use 'explicit' to force a higher base stock. However, a safer way to reset the pipeline calculation in the OR engine is to use a very high explicit mu_hat to overcome the phantom inventory, or acknowledge the lead time instability. Given the goal to maximize profit and the upcoming late spring/early summer season (May), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) covering the stable 72-unit regime and use explicit L=2 to match promised expectations while monitoring P10's arrival.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure at Period 12: Pipeline inventory is inflated by 462 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are >7 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Only orders under 160 units (P2, P7) have successfully arrived.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/06), the 'Jessy Jersey Skirt' continues to face a massive supply chain failure. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 662 units, but historical analysis confirms that large orders from P1 (92), P3 (221), and P4 (149)\u2014totaling 462 units\u2014are significantly overdue (>8 periods) and must be considered lost. Only the small order from P7 arrived successfully. Recent orders from P10 (154) and P12 (46) are the only credible pieces of the pipeline. Since the backend OR engine subtracts 'total pipeline' (662) from the base stock, it will stop ordering unless the base stock parameter is artificially inflated to account for the 462 lost units. Demand remains stable around 75 units (Avg P9-P12 = 71.75). To force an order and bypass the \u2018ghost\u2019 inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + Lost Units = (1+2)*75 + 462 = 687. This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the 662 units in transit, triggering a fresh replenishment for this high-demand spring item.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure persistent: Pipeline is inflated by 462 units (P1, P3, P4) that are >8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. OR parameters must explicitly compensate for this 'ghost' inventory to allow new orders.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the supply chain for SKU 729928001 remains severely compromised. We have 732 units in 'In-transit', but history confirms a pattern where larger orders are consistently 'lost' or indefinitely delayed (P1: 92 units, P3: 221 units, P4: 149 units = 462 units total). Only small orders (P2, P7) have successfully arrived. Specifically, orders from P10 (154 units), P12 (46 units), and P13 (70 units) are currently undelivered. If P10 (placed 4 periods ago) does not arrive soon, it will join the 'lost' category. The OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock; because 462 units are 'ghost' units that will likely never arrive, we must artificially inflate our base stock parameters to force the OR engine to place new orders. Average demand has stabilized since early April at approximately 75 units (Avg of P9-P13: 70.2). To trigger replenishment despite the 732 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1100. This value is calculated to exceed the ghost inventory (462) plus the necessary stock to cover the promised lead time (L=2, so 3 periods of demand \u2248 225) and some safety stock, effectively 'tricking' the engine into ordering despite the stalled pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed 'Ghost' Pipeline of 462 units (P1, P3, P4) is preventing new orders; explicit mu_hat inflation is required until these units are purged or bypassed. Recent demand (P9-P13) is stable at ~70 units/period after Spring volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20), we face a critical supply chain failure. The pipeline of 1,181 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' inventory: orders from P1 (92), P3 (221), P4 (149), and P10 (154) are now 5 to 14 periods old and effectively lost. Only small, recent orders (P12, P13) have arrived or are moving. Total lost inventory is approximately 616 units. The OR backend subtracts this 1,181 from its base stock calculation; if mu_hat is set to the current demand level (~70/week * (2+1) = 210), it will never place an order. To force a replenishment order and bypass the 1,181 units held 'in-transit', I must set mu_hat to a value significantly higher than the pipeline (mu_hat > 1181) plus expected demand. I am setting mu_hat = 1450 (approx 1200 existing pipeline + 210 expected demand + safety buffer). L is set to 2 (promised) as recent successful deliveries (P12) hit that mark. Demand is stable around 70, but mu_hat is being used as a lever to overcome the pipeline blockage.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage severe: 616 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) confirmed lost. Total 'ghost' in-transit inventory is 1181. Mu_hat must be set >1200 to trigger any new orders until this inventory is purged.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 729928001 is severely compromised. A total of 616 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10) are extremely overdue and confirmed lost. These 'ghost' units remain in the backend's in-transit calculation, preventing new orders. The backend uses a 'cap' based on mu_hat and a base_stock target. Currently, in-transit is 1466. To trigger a new order, mu_hat must exceed this 'ghost' inventory plus the pipeline inventory. In P14 and P15, we attempted to bypass this with high mu_hat values, but demand has also slowed down (avg ~50 units recently). We must set mu_hat high enough to satisfy (Demand * (L+1)) while offsetting the 1466 units of stalled pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1800 to ensure we place an order to cover upcoming demand, as current on-hand is 0 and we are losing sales every period.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 1466 units contains at least 616 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10) that will likely never arrive. Explicit mu_hat inflation > 1500 is required until these units are manually purged or bypassed by very high stock targets. Recent demand (P14-P15) has cooled to ~47 units/period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for SKU 729928001 is severely compromised, with at least 616 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) confirmed lost, and several subsequent orders significantly overdue. Current on-hand inventory is 0, while 'In-transit' has ballooned to 1822 units due to these 'ghost' shipments. Because the OR backend subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base stock (base_stock - pipeline), and the backend is unaware that these units are lost, it will not place new orders unless the mu_hat parameter is set high enough to offset the ghost pipeline. Recent demand (P14-P16) indicates a cooling trend, averaging ~60 units per period. To trigger an order that covers approximately 3 periods of actual demand (target ~180-200 units on-hand) while bypassing the 1822 units of ghost/stalled inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2100. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a high service level without excessive over-ordering if the pipe suddenly flushes.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse: 1822 units in-transit are predominantly 'ghost' inventory from P1-P16. Orders only arrive sporadically or not at all. Explicit mu_hat inflation >1800 is the only way to bypass the backend pipeline check to get new stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-276.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we finally received a significant inflow of 641 units (from Period 15 and 16 orders), bringing on-hand inventory to 568 units. This confirms that while the supply chain for this SKU is highly unstable and older large orders (P1, P3, P4, P10 totalling 616 units) are effectively lost, newer orders can still arrive. The current on-hand inventory of 568 units is sufficient to cover approximately 8 periods of recent average demand (~70 units/period). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1502 units still contains roughly 900+ units of 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now potentially P13/P14 which are overdue). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory as available supply and blocking future necessary orders, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat of 2000. This ensures the base stock level (target) remains above the inflated pipeline, allowing the system to place orders when physically necessary. Since we have a surplus of 568 units on-hand, the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend will naturally limit any excessive ordering this period, providing a safety buffer while we wait to see if more recent orders (P17) arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: On-hand inventory recovered to 568 units after P15/P16 arrivals; however, 'ghost' pipeline inventory persists at ~900+ units. High explicit mu_hat remains necessary to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 487 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 6-7 periods of current demand (~75 units/period). However, the system shows 1,502 units in-transit. Based on history, at least 616 units (P1, P3, P4, P10) are 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. Additionally, the recent large orders from P14 (495 units) and P17 (321 units) are still in the pipeline. If P14 arrives, we will be significantly overstocked given the holding cost of $1.0 vs profit of $4.0. The current on-hand inventory of 487 is well above the safety stock needed for a 2-period lead time. To prevent triggering further unnecessary orders and to allow the current on-hand stock and actual pipeline to satisfy demand, mu_hat is set to a value below the (on-hand + in-transit) threshold. L is kept at 2, and mu_hat is set to a 'recent_N' of 5 to reflect stabilized demand around 70-80 units, which (with the backend formula) will result in a base stock lower than our current pipeline, thereby placing no new order.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), on-hand inventory is 388 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current average rate (~80-90 units). The in-transit inventory is extremely high (1502 units), but history confirms a tracking failure where older orders (P1, P3, P4, P10 totaling 616 units) are lost, creating 'ghost' pipeline inventory that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from future orders. However, with 388 units on hand and 321 units from P17 still likely to arrive (having been placed recently and not yet confirmed as lost), there is no immediate risk of stockout. The profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1) suggests a service level of 80%, implying a base stock target of approximately 3-4 weeks of demand. Given the significant on-hand surplus and the ongoing supply chain noise, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand stability (~80 units) and let the OR backend's pipeline logic naturally suppress new orders until the 'ghost' inventory is resolved or on-hand levels drop significantly.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand is stable between 70-100 units through June. On-hand inventory rebuilt to 388 units; new orders should be paused until on-hand inventory depletes closer to 2-3 weeks of coverage to minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $422.00

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), the current on-hand inventory is 226 units, which covers approximately 2-2.5 weeks of demand based on the recent average of ~100 units/period (reflecting the spike to 162 in Period 20). The supply chain remains unreliable with a 'ghost' pipeline of approximately 1,502 units, consisting mostly of lost orders from periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 14. To prevent premature ordering while on-hand stock is sufficient, I am keeping parameters conservative. Using mu_hat at 1500 (explicit) ensures we stay below the pipeline threshold to prevent new orders, as the current 226 units on-hand is a comfortable buffer and we want to avoid additional holding costs for this 'Short skater skirt' as we move deeper into summer.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand remains strong into summer (162 units in P20). Supply chain bifurcation continues: small/recent orders (P12, P15, P16) arrive in 1-2 periods, while large legacy orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14) totaling ~1100+ units are confirmed lost, bloating the visible 'In-transit' figure to 1502.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is currently in a summer demand phase with relatively strong performance (P20: 162, P21: 111). On-hand inventory has naturally depleted to 115 units, which covers approximately one week of sales. However, the system's 'In-transit' count is severely bloated at 1502 units due to 'ghost' inventory (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, and P15-P17) totaling approximately 1300+ units that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. This 'ghost' pipeline prevents the OR backend from placing necessary replenishment orders because it believes the pipeline already exceeds any reasonable stock target. To bypass this and ensure the system can order as on-hand stock falls below safety levels, I must set the mu_hat parameter high enough to exceed the ghost pipeline plus current on-hand inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 1900 to trigger a small replenishment order now that on-hand is approaching zero. I am using recent_N for sigma to capture the high volatility seen in the product's recent 100-160 unit demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand remains strong (110-160 range). Supply chain 'Ghost' inventory is currently ~1300-1400 units, necessitating mu_hat targets above 1800 to bypass backend logic.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the SKU is entering the peak of the summer season. Recent demand from P19-P22 has averaged approximately 115 units, indicating a rise compared to the spring baseline. On-hand inventory has depleted to 24 units, and demand is currently outpacing supply visibility. The central challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory: approximately 1,500 units from older, large orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, etc.) are over 8 periods past visibility and theoretically clog the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend (Current In-transit: 1837). To ensure the backend triggers a new order, the base stock target (mu_hat) must exceed (In-transit + On-hand). I will set mu_hat to 2200 to clear this hurdle and target approximately 250-300 units of fresh stock (enough for ~2 weeks of summer demand). Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high summer demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Ghost inventory remains critical at ~1500 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14), necessitating mu_hat targets above 2000 to trigger any orders. Summer demand (July) is averaging ~115 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 24 (July 22), the product (short jersey skirt) is in high summer demand. Recent demand (P20-P23) has averaged 112 units (162, 111, 91, 84). The supply chain remains heavily compromised by 'ghost' inventory: P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P15, and P16 comprise an estimated 1,500+ units in the 'In-transit' figure that are long-overdue and confirmed lost/stalled. Currently, 'In-transit' is 1,909 units. To trigger any new replenishment orders from the OR backend (which subtracts total in-transit from the base stock), we must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds this 'ghost' pipeline plus current on-hand (275). Aiming for a target stock of approx 2,500 units to ensure consistent ordering while bypassing the ~1,900 unit pipeline hurdle. We set L to explicit 2 to match the promised lead time/recent successful patterns, and mu_hat to 2,500 to force the backend to place an order of approximately 2500 - 1909 - 275 = 316 units.

Carry-over insight: Persistent Supply Chain Failure: 'In-transit' figure of 1,909 units is roughly 80% 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P15, P16) that is confirmed lost. Mu_hat must be maintained at >2100 to bypass backend inventory logic until these units are purged.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (Late July), demand has shown sustained summer strength, averaging 115 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). The main challenge remains the massive 'ghost' pipeline: the reported 'In-transit' of 2394 units includes approximately 2100+ units from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P15, P16, and P17 that are significantly past their delivery window and likely lost. The backend OR logic subtracts this entire 2394 units from the base stock calculation, which would prevent any new orders if mu_hat were set normally. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to a level that exceeds (ghost inventory + on-hand) while targeting enough stock for 3 periods (L+1). Current on-hand is 146. To target approx 345 units (3 periods of 115) and account for 2394 in-transit, the effective base stock must be at least 2739. I am setting mu_hat to 2750 to ensure the backend generates a replenishment order to maintain availability as on-hand depletes.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Summer demand (July) is sustained at ~115 units/period. Ghost inventory has ballooned to ~2100 units due to cumulative delivery failures from P1-P17, requiring mu_hat targets >2700 to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (2019/8/5), the SKU continues to suffer from a systemic supply chain failure. The 'In-transit' figure has reached 2647 units, but the vast majority of this (approx. 2400 units) consists of 'ghost' inventory from failed deliveries in P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P23, and P24. True lead time for successful arrivals is currently 1-2 periods (e.g., P22 ordered 335 units, arrived P23). Demand in July has remained healthy, averaging ~100 units. To bypass the backend's pipeline inventory check\u2014which subtracts the massive 'ghost' in-transit figure from the base stock\u2014I must set mu_hat explicitly higher than the current in-transit plus desired safety stock. Setting mu_hat to 3200 (calculated as >2647 + (100 * 3)) ensures the system continues to order fresh units to meet real-time demand while on-hand inventory is at 71 (only ~1 week cover).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative ghost inventory has reached approx. 2400 units. Mu_hat must be maintained at >3000 to bypass the backend pipeline check and maintain a replenishment flow for summer demand (avg ~100/period).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/8/12), the SKU '729928001' is facing a massive 'ghost' pipeline issue. The 'In-transit' count is 2,849 units, but historical analysis confirms nearly all of this (at least 2,400+ units) consists of lost orders from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P15, P16, etc.) that will never arrive. Current on-hand inventory is 425 units after the P23 order finally arrived (lead time 3). Average demand for this short skater skirt has remained steady through July/August at approximately 80-100 units/period, with a slight dip to 53 in P26. With 425 units on-hand, we have approximately 4-5 weeks of coverage. However, because the backend OR policy subtracts the 'ghost' pipeline (2,849) from the base stock Target, no new orders will be generated unless mu_hat is set extremely high. To bypass this and ensure we can replenish when on-hand inventory drops further, I am setting mu_hat to 3800. This target captures the 2,849 ghost units plus a desired safety stock for the current period and lead time. This is a technical override to maintain replenishment flow despite system-level data corruption.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent supply chain failure confirmed. Total ghost inventory is approximately 2,500 units. Mu_hat must be maintained above 3,500 to bypass backend pipeline logic for the remainder of the season.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the system shows 625 units on-hand and a massive 'In-transit' figure of 3,168 units. Based on historical data, the 'true' pipeline consists of only P24 (485 units), P26 (609 units), and P27 (572 units), totaling 1,666 units. The remaining ~1,502 units are 'ghost' inventory from orders placed months ago (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17) that failed to arrive and will likely never conclude. The backend OR logic subtracts the full 3,168 in-transit units from its target. Recent demand has cooled from the summer peak (~115) to ~53 units over the last two weeks. To maintain a replenishment flow and counter the backend's subtraction of 1,500 units of ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds (On-hand + Ghost In-transit + Target Stock). With on-hand at 625 and ghost inventory at ~1,500, a mu_hat of 4,000 ensures the backend continues to place orders despite the supply chain bifurcation. Sigma_hat is set to 200 to accommodate the volatility observed between high summer demand and recent cooling.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total 'In-transit' of 3,168 units contains approximately 1,500 units of ghost inventory (P1, P3, P10, P14, P17). Recent demand (P26-P27) has dropped to ~50 units/period from the summer average of ~115. Continued mu_hat inflation >4000 is necessary to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), demand for the Jersey Skirt is cooling, averaging 52 units over the past three periods compared to the summer peak of ~115 units. Current on-hand inventory is 575 units, which covers approximately 11 periods of current demand. However, the system is burdened by a massive 'In-transit' figure of 3,544 units, most of which (approx. 2,000+ units) are 'ghost' inventory from failed legacy shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P14, P17). Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless the target (mu_hat) is set significantly higher than the in-transit value. Although current on-hand is high, we must maintain a high mu_hat to ensure the backend logic does not permanently freeze replenishment once on-hand levels drop. I am setting mu_hat to 4500 (explicit) to bypass the pipeline check and L to 2 (default) as recent successful arrivals (P22, P23, P25) show lead times of 1-3 periods. This strategy keeps the pipeline 'open' for when on-hand stock naturally depletes.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand has entered a late-summer/autumn cooling phase, stabilizing at ~50 units/period (P26-P28 avg). Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline remains approximately 2,000-2,500 units, requiring mu_hat inflation >4000 to bypass backend ordering constraints.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 505 units. Recent demand (P26-P29) has cooled significantly to an average of ~56 units per period, meaning current stock covers approximately 9 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 3,974 units is extremely bloated with 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost orders P1, P3, P10, P14, P17, etc.) and delayed summer orders (P24, P28, P29). Because on-hand inventory is well above the desired safety stock for the current cooling demand phase, I will set mu_hat to a low 'explicit' value to pause new orders. This avoids further increasing holding costs while waiting for the existing physical stock and any potentially viable in-transit units (like P24 or P28) to be processed. I am setting mu_hat = 100 to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in zero new orders this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling phase confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~115 (summer peak) to ~56 units/period (P26-P29). Inventory strategy shifted to drainage mode as on-hand (505) exceeds 8-9 weeks of current demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory has spiked to 1400 units following the arrival of P27 and P28 orders (948 units total). Current demand has entered a cooling phase (Sept 9th), averaging approximately 56 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30). With 1400 units on hand, we have approximately 25 periods of coverage at current demand levels. To minimize significant holding costs ($1.0/unit), we must avoid placing any new orders. The backend OR logic subtracts the pipeline (3026 units, mostly 'ghost' inventory) from the base_stock (derived from mu_hat). To prevent new orders, mu_hat must be set lower than the combined on-hand and pipeline inventory. Since on-hand + pipeline = 4426, any mu_hat below this value will result in a zero order. I will set mu_hat to 0 to ensure the policy remains in drainage mode.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Transitioning to aggressive inventory drainage; on-hand inventory (1400) provides ~25 weeks of coverage for the current demand regime (~56 units/period). New orders are suspended to mitigate holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1065.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is currently in a late-summer/early-autumn cooling phase. On-hand inventory is exceptionally high at 1,333 units following the arrival of periods 27 and 28 orders (totaling 948 units). Current demand (P26-P31) has stabilized at approximately 58 units per period (N=6). With 1,333 units on hand, the inventory coverage is approximately 23 weeks, which far exceeds the remaining 15 periods of the game. Consequently, the primary objective is to drain inventory to minimize holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) while satisfying the significantly lower demand regime. To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, mu_hat is set significantly lower than the combination of on-hand and in-transit inventory (totaling 4,359 units). No further mu_hat inflation is necessary as we are now intentionally in a 'drainage mode'.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Inventory drainage strategy finalized; current on-hand (1,333) provides ~23 weeks of coverage for the autumn demand regime (~58 units/period). All future ordering is suspended to mitigate holding costs as supply outstrips remaining game duration.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an inventory drainage phase (Period 33 of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 1,268 units, while demand has stabilized at an autumn average of approximately 59 units/period (mean of P26-P32). This on-hand stock provides roughly 21.5 weeks of coverage, which exceeds the remaining 14 weeks of the game. Additionally, there is a massive 'In-transit' balance of 3,026 units, much of which is 'ghost' inventory but even partial arrivals would further inflate the surplus. To maximize reward, we must avoid additional holding costs by ensuring no new orders are placed. I am setting parameters to ensure the base stock level remains significantly below the sum of on-hand and in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory strategy remains in 'drainage mode'. On-hand inventory stands at 1,148 units, which, even with a recent demand spike to 120 units in Period 33, provides approximately 10-15 weeks of coverage based on the autumn demand regime (~50-80 units/period). Given we are at Period 34 of 47, the remaining 13 periods are more than sufficiently covered by the existing on-hand stock and the massive 'In-transit' pipeline (3,026 units), much of which is likely ghost inventory from earlier systemic failures. To maximize total reward and minimize holding costs ($1/unit/period), all new ordering must continue to be suspended. I will maintain default parameters as they do not trigger orders when on-hand is significantly above the target stock level.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an inventory drainage phase. On-hand inventory stands at 1,058 units, while the most recent demand (P33-P34) has averaged 105 units/period. Even with this slight uptick from the previous regime (~58 units), the current stock provides approximately 10 weeks of coverage. Given the game is in Period 35 of 47, and the significant 'ghost' pipeline (visible in the in-transit figure of 3,026 units) would require extreme mu_hat inflation to bypass, it is optimal to continue the suspension of new orders. This minimizes further holding costs (which are high at $1.0/unit/period) while comfortably meeting expected customer demand for the remainder of the season.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Inventory drainage remains the optimal strategy. On-hand inventory (1058) covers 10+ weeks of current demand (~105 units/period), outlasting the remaining 12 periods of the game. Total in-transit (3026) is heavily skewed by 'ghost' inventory from previous supply chain failures.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The strategy remains in persistent inventory drainage mode. In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 977 units. Recent demand (P33-P35) has shown a slight uptick compared to the August-September cooling period, averaging approximately 97 units per period. Despite this increase, the existing on-hand stock provides approximately 10 full periods of coverage (977 / 97 \u2248 10). With only 11 periods remaining in the game (P37-P47), and a significant volume of 'ghost' inventory (visible in the 3026 unit In-transit figure) potentially arriving and adding further holding cost pressure, no new orders should be placed. The goal is to minimize ending inventory and holding costs while meeting demand from the current surplus. To ensure the backend does not trigger an order due to the pipeline inventory logic (even though pipeline is high, base stock might theoretically exceed it if parameters weren't controlled), I will maintain neutral parameters.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '729928001' (Jessy Jersey Skirt) is currently in a drainage phase. As of Period 37, there are 11 periods remaining in the game. Current on-hand inventory is 923 units, while the demand regime has recently averaged approximately 81.8 units over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). At this consumption rate, the existing stock represents over 11 weeks of coverage, which is sufficient to satisfy all remaining demand for the duration of the game without further ordering. The 'In-transit' figure of 3026 is largely comprised of historical 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, etc.) and delayed summer orders that are no longer needed. To maximize total reward and minimize holding costs, ordering must remain suspended. I will keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at default levels, which, combined with the massive pipeline and on-hand inventory, will prevent the OR backend from triggering any new orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019 (Period 38). On-hand inventory is 818 units, while recent demand (P33-P37) has averaged approximately 90 units per period. With 10 periods remaining in the game, the total expected demand is approximately 900 units. The current on-hand stock (818) plus any viable units from the massive in-transit pipeline (3,026 units, though much is 'ghost' inventory) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining lifespan of the product. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) without increasing sales, as the stock-out risk is negligible. Therefore, I am maintaining the drainage strategy by setting parameters that will result in a zero order: L is set to default, mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to the smallest possible values (recent_N=1) to ensure the backend base_stock calculation remains far below the existing on-hand plus in-transit inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (early November), the game is in its final phase with only 8 periods remaining (ends at 47). Current on-hand inventory is 691 units. Recent demand (P33-P38) has fluctuated between 54 and 127, averaging approximately 96 units per period. If this average holds, 691 units of on-hand inventory provide coverage for approximately 7.2 periods, which aligns almost perfectly with the remaining game duration. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and the presence of a massive 'ghost' pipeline (3,026 units, largely consisting of historic lost orders), the priority remains inventory drainage. Attempting to order more would only increase holding costs without providing additional utility, especially since the OR backend would require an extremely high mu_hat (likely >4000) just to trigger a shipment against the visible in-transit figure. Therefore, I am maintaining zero orders by keeping parameters at default settings while the on-hand stock naturally depletes.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the primary objective is to maximize profit by draining the remaining on-hand inventory (611 units) while minimizing holding costs over the final 7 periods of the game. Current demand is approximately 80-100 units per period (Avg of P37-P39 is 104). At a consumption rate of ~100 units/period, the 611 units on-hand provide 6 periods of coverage, which is nearly sufficient for the remaining 7 periods. Given the enormous amount of 'ghost' inventory (3,026 units in-transit) which includes historical losses from Periods 1-30, any ordering would be blocked by the OR backend unless mu_hat was set to extremely high values (>4000). However, since on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover most of the remaining game and holding costs are $1/unit, placing new orders at this late stage would likely lead to excess inventory and significant losses. Therefore, I will maintain the drainage strategy by keeping parameters that result in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Inventory drainage continues. On-hand stock (611) provides ~6 weeks of coverage against current demand (~100 units/period). With 7 periods remaining, the risk of stockout is minimal compared to the certainty of high holding costs from new arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 41 with 7 periods remaining (end at Period 47). Current on-hand inventory is 540 units. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), the average demand has been approximately 87.4 units/period (54, 105, 127, 80, 71). At this consumption rate, the existing stock of 540 units provides approximately 6.1 weeks of coverage. Since only 7 periods remain and the promised lead time is 2 periods (with actual lead times often being longer), any order placed now would arrive too late to be useful or would simply contribute to excessive ending inventory and holding costs ($1/unit/period). The focus remains on maximizing total reward by liquidating existing on-hand stock and avoiding new holding costs. New orders are suspended.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), there are 5 periods remaining in the game. Current on-hand inventory is 450 units. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has averaged 94.6 units per period (105, 127, 80, 71, 90). At this consumption rate, the existing stock of 450 units provides approximately 4.75 periods of coverage, aligning almost exactly with the game's conclusion. Given the high holding cost ($1.00/unit/period) and the significant volume of 'ghost' inventory still in the pipeline (3026 units), any new order would likely arrive too late to be sold or would simply incur excessive holding costs. The strategy remains to drain the current on-hand inventory to maximize profit and minimize ending inventory costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $765.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43 of 47. On-hand inventory is 207 units. Recent demand has shown a significant seasonal spike in Period 42 (243 units), likely tied to Black Friday/pre-holiday shopping for this 'short skater skirt'. Even with this spike, the average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is ~122 units. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (Decision for P43, P44, P45, P46), the total remaining demand is estimated between 400-500 units. While 207 units on-hand might seem slightly low, any order placed now (P43) with a promised lead time of 2 (actually arriving in P45 or later) would incur significant holding costs for any units that arrive just as the game ends, especially given the supply chain's history of massive 'ghost' arrivals. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, and the large 'In-transit' figure (3026) which contains thousands of 'ghost' units that could randomly arrive and spike holding costs, the safest path to maximizing total reward is to continue draining the existing on-hand stock and avoid triggering any new shipments.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike detected: Period 42 demand increased to 243 units (+140% vs previous 4-week average).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final phase of the game (Period 44 of 47). Current on-hand inventory is 95 units. In Period 42, we observed a holiday demand spike of 243 units, followed by 112 units in Period 43. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (including this one), our primary objective is to maximize profit while minimizing holding costs and avoiding inventory write-offs. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning any order placed now (P44) would arrive in Period 46, leaving only one period of sales potential. However, history shows that arrivals are highly unreliable and the pipeline is severely bloated with ~3,000 units of 'ghost' inventory that will likely never arrive. Even if we wanted to order, the OR backend's base-stock logic would require an extremely high mu_hat (estimated >3500) to overcome the pipeline inventory count. Given that we have 95 units on-hand and 3-4 periods of demand left, and historical demand (excluding the extreme Thanksgiving spike) averages between 70-100, we might experience a slight stockout in the final 1-2 periods. However, the cost of a stockout ($4 profit/unit) is significantly outweighed by the risk of ordering and receiving hundreds of units (due to the OR backend's minimum order logic) that would incur high holding costs ($1/unit/period) and have zero value at the end of Period 47. Therefore, the optimal strategy remains inventory drainage; we will not place new orders.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand (Late Nov/Early Dec) reached ~243 units then moderated to ~112. Total simulation termination at Period 47 makes further replenishment economically unviable given supply chain lead times and reliability.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 45 with only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (terminating at Period 47). As of the end of Period 44, on-hand inventory is 0. While there is a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 3,026 units, historical analysis confirms that the vast majority of this (at least 2,500+ units) is 'ghost' inventory from failed deliveries early in the year. Although we had a stockout in Period 44 (sold 95 against demand of 118), the promised lead time is 2 periods. Any order placed now in Period 45 would arrive during Period 47 (the final period) and only be available for sale in Period 48, which does not exist. Even if some of the more recent 'genuine' in-transit units from P26-29 were to arrive, they would be pure holding cost sinks with no remaining periods to generate profit. Therefore, the optimal strategy for the final periods is to maintain zero new orders to maximize total reward by avoiding unnecessary holding costs on units that cannot be sold.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46, which is the second-to-last period of the simulation (total periods = 47). The current date is December 23, 2019. On-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 44 caused by the holiday demand spike. While demand exists (70 units in Period 45), the promised lead time is 2 periods. Any order placed now in Period 46 would arrive, at the earliest, during the arrival resolution phase of Period 48 (following the logic: Order P46 -> Arrives during P48). Since the game ends after Period 47 conclude, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or generate revenue, but will incur holding costs or simply remain 'in-transit' at termination. Additionally, there is a massive 'In-transit' balance of 3026 units, which consists largely of 'ghost' inventory from failed deliveries throughout the year. Placing an order would yield no benefit. Therefore, I am maintaining parameters that prevent new orders by allowing the default OR logic to see the pipeline inventory as sufficient or simply recognizing the endgame constraint.

Carry-over insight: Simulation near termination (P46 of 47). No further orders are economically viable as they will arrive after the game ends.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is at Period 47 (Final Period). The game concludes after this period's demand resolution. Any order placed now would not arrive within the simulation timeframe (Lead Time = 2). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a 'ghost' pipeline of 3026 units. Given that this is the final decision point, the objective is to minimize potential holding costs for units that might arrive in the final moments or simply to cease all activity as the simulation ends. Therefore, L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are kept constant/default to ensure no new orders are triggered.
