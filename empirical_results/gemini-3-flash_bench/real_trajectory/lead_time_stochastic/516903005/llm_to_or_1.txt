Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 516903005 (Knitwear/Sweater). Initial demand history (Jan-Feb) shows a stable average of approximately 17.8 units per week. Given the date is mid-February, we are still within the typical season for sweaters/knitwear. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the total lead time plus review period (L+1) is 3 periods. The 'default' method for mu_hat will compute (1+L) * mean of all samples, providing a baseline of ~53 units. I will use 'default' for L and sigma_hat as well, as there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or volume volatility shifts. No shipments have been placed yet, and no history of lead-time performance exists.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a textured cotton-blend jumper. In Period 1, we had 0 on-hand inventory and a demand of 11, resulting in 0 sales and 11 lost sales opportunities. An order of 22 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for sale in Period 4. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of 17.8 units/week. Period 1 demand was lower at 11, but we should not overreact to one data point, especially since we are currently out of stock. I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but for mu_hat, I will use a window of 5 (recent_N) to capture the pre-launch historical data plus the first period's observation, providing a balanced forecast of approximately (1+2)*16.5 = 49.5 units over the lead time plus review period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a 'textured cotton-blend knit jumper', a seasonal item likely moving from winter into early spring. Historical demand (Jan-Early Feb) averaged ~18 units/week. However, in Period 2 (last week), demand spiked to 31 units, potentially signaling a late winter demand surge or a promotion. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 44 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Promised lead time is 2. The order from P1 (22 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P3 resolution) and become visible at the start of P4. The order from P2 should arrive in P4 (visible in P5). My goal is to ensure the backend base stock covers L+1 periods of demand. Given the recent spike, I will use a recent_N average (N=3) to capture the trend while smoothing the volatility. I will keep L at the default promised lead time of 2 as there is no evidence of delay yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a cotton-blend sweater, which likely sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. Historical demand (including pre-game samples) has been relatively stable, averaging ~18.8 units per week (samples: 20, 14, 19, 18, 18; game: 11, 31, 14). Total demand average is ~18.1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. We have orders from P1 (22 units), P2 (22 units), and P3 (31 units) currently in transit (total 75). Per the L+1 rule, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible now at the start of P4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a potential lead time delay or a misunderstanding of the reporting sync. According to the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3 and is visible at the start of P4. Since P3 conclude says 'arrived=0', the P1 order is officially late or the lead time is effectively \u2265 3. To prevent a prolonged stockout (current on-hand is 0), I will explicitly set L to 3 to reflect this observed delay. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (all available data points) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full recent distribution, which averages roughly 18 units per period. This gives a mu_hat of (1+3)*18 = 72.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/11. The product is a cotton-blend sweater, which typically sees steady demand in late winter/early spring. Historical demand samples (20, 14, 19, 18, 18) average 17.8. Game history demand (11, 31, 14, 16) matches this range, though Period 2 showed a spike. Promised lead time is 2, and the first recorded arrival (Period 2's order arriving in Period 4) confirms an actual lead time of 2. On-hand is low (6 units). Total in-transit is 61 (from Periods 1, 3, 4). The Period 1 order (22 units) should have arrived in Period 3 if lead time was 2, but it did not, and no conclusion was recorded. Given the prompt's warning about lost shipments, I will monitor this. However, since the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time in Period 4, the logistics system seems functional. I will use a recent demand window to capture the slight downward trend in demand observed in the last two periods (14, 16) compared to the spike in Period 2.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a textured cotton-blend jumper. Historical demand mean is approx 18.7 units/week. Current on-hand is 0, with 69 units in-transit. A lead time of 2 periods was confirmed in Period 4. The order from Period 1 (22 units) has likely been lost as it is now 5 periods since the order date without arrival. The order from Period 3 (31 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 6 resolution) but is not yet visible. Because of the lost Period 1 order and current 0 on-hand stock, there is an inventory gap. Orders from P3, P4, and P5 (31+8+8=47) plus the current decision must cover likely demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the demand mean (approx 18.2) and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period and offsets the missing inventory from the lost P1 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 1 (22 units) confirmed lost/overdue (5 periods since order, L=2). Demand remains stable around 18 units/week.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Sally Structure TVP' (Cotton-blend jumper) is experiencing high demand variability and supply instability. In Period 6, we observed demand of 34 units (nearly double the recent average), and a shipment from Period 5 arrived early (L=1). Crucially, shipments from Period 1 (ordered P1) and Period 3 (ordered P3) are overdue or lost; despite an 'In-transit' count of 61, historical data shows only shipments from P2 and P5 have physically arrived. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the last two periods. The recent 3-week demand average is 23 units (up from the initial 18). Given the volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 10) and the risk of lost shipments, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture the recent spike and setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high variance and stockout risk. Lead time L is set to default (2) as the early arrival in P6 may be an anomaly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: Demand peaked at 34 units; 3-period average increased to 23 units (+27%). Multiple shipments (P1, P3) are confirmed overdue/lost as of P7.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019-04-01), the SKU 516903005 (cotton-blend sweater) is experiencing a demand surge, likely due to spring seasonality transition. We have zero on-hand inventory and observed demand peaked at 38 units in P7. Historical lead times have been erratic: P2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), P5 order arrived in 1 period (P6), while orders from P1, P3, and P4 appear lost or severely delayed (P1 is now 7 periods old). To address the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the increased mean (~29 units/week) over the last three periods (34, 38, mean of samples). I am setting L to explicit=3 because the frequency of missing or delayed shipments suggests the system-assumed L=2 is insufficient to cover the variability and risk of stockouts. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the heightened volatility during this regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean increased from ~18 to ~29 units/week starting P6. Lead-time instability confirmed: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (78 units total) are significantly overdue or lost as of P8.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 8th, 2019. This product is a 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater, which has seen a significant demand shift starting around Period 6 (March 18th), likely due to early spring seasonal factors or collection popularity. The mean demand for the last 3 periods (P6-P8) is 35.33 units, up from the initial baseline of ~18. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory (108 units) reflects orders from P1 (22), P3 (31), P4 (8), and P8 (47). Based on history: P2 arrived in P4 (L=2), P5 arrived in P6 (L=1), and P7 arrived in P8 (L=1). However, P1 (ordered 8 weeks ago), P3 (ordered 6 weeks ago), and P4 (ordered 5 weeks ago) are extremely overdue and must be considered 'lost'. The OR backend includes ALL in-transit units in its pipeline calculation. If I don't adjust, the backend will see 108 units 'coming' and stop ordering. To force an order that covers the new demand regime (approx 35.33/week) while 'ignoring' the 61 lost units (22+31+8), I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover L+1 periods (2+1 = 3 weeks) at the new demand rate: 3 * 35.33 = 106. Since the backend subtracts the full 108 in-transit from the base stock, I will set mu_hat to a value that ensures a positive order is placed to replenish the stock-out. Setting mu_hat to 160 (covering roughly 4.5 weeks of demand) to compensate for the 'ghost' inventory in pipeline that won't arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability issue: Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (61 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Actual lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized at 1.0 periods (based on P5 and P7).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Sally Structure TVP' (Jumper/Sweater) is experiencing a seasonality-driven demand shift mid-April, which aligns with typical spring knitwear transitions. Historical demand significantly shifted starting at Period 6 (2019-03-18), moving from a mean of ~18 units to ~35 units. The last four periods (P6-P9) recorded demands of 34, 38, 34, and 36, confirming a new stable regime. Regarding lead times: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are long overdue and confirmed lost, while recent successful deliveries (P5 and P7) arrived with a lead time of 1 period. Therefore, I will set L to 1. For demand, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (~35 units/week). My mu_hat will target (1+1) * 35 = 70. This ensures the OR backend attempts to restore inventory levels to cover the new demand level despite the recent lost shipments and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 2 (P6-P9): Mean demand increased to 35.5 units/week (+97% vs baseline).

Prior to Period 6, demand averaged ~18 units; since Period 6, demand has averaged ~33.6 units (samples: 34, 38, 34, 36, 26). The most recent demand (26) suggests the peak might be tapering, but we must maintain a robust stock level. Regarding lead times, the history shows instability: while the promised lead time is 2, recent successful arrivals from Periods 7 and 9 had a lead time of 1, and the arrival from Period 8 had a lead time of 2. Orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost. Currently, we have 76 units on hand and 61 in-transit (ordered in Period 10, likely reaching us in P11 or P12). Given the 1-2 period lead time fluctuation, I will use L=2 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend calculates safety stock for the full promised window. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (~33.6 units/week) multiplied by (1+L).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516903005' (textured knit sweater) has entered late April, transitioning away from peak spring demand season. Historical demand shows a significant regime shift starting at Period 6 (March 18), where weekly demand increased from ~18 to ~35. However, the last two periods (P10: 26, P11: 16) indicate a sharp deceleration as warming weather likely reduces demand for sweaters. The current on-hand inventory is 60 units with 61 units in-transit (reflecting lost shipments from P1, P3, P4 that the backend still counts toward pipeline). Since these 61 units are practically confirmed lost/overdue (well past the 2-period promise), the actual manageable pipeline is zero. The 60 units on-hand are sufficient for nearly 4 periods of current demand trends. To prevent overstocking during this seasonal downturn, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent slowdown (averaging ~26), and use explicit lead time L=1 to reflect recent observed arrival performance, allowing the OR backend to hold back on replenishment until the current stock is absorbed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 3 (P10-P11): Post-peak spring demand deceleration confirmed; weekly average dropped from ~35 to ~21 units (-40%). Seasonality for knitwear/sweaters is entering a cooling phase in late April.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), demand for the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater is stabilizing at a lower level following the spring peak. The last three periods (P10-P12) show demand of 26, 16, and 32 units, resulting in a mean of 24.6 units/week. This aligns with the seasonal transition to late spring/early summer. The supply chain has shown recent lead times of 1 and 2 periods (P8 arrived in 2, P9 in 1), so L=2 remains a safe estimate. Currently, on-hand inventory is 28 units, and the in-transit balance is 61 units (reflecting orders that the system still tracks, though some from P1/P3/P4 are likely lost). Given the carry-over insight of a 'post-peak deceleration', I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on this new lower demand regime (~24.6 units/week) rather than the previous high of 35.5. This will prevent over-ordering as the season cools.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (textured cotton-blend sweater) is currently in a post-peak spring deceleration phase as the calendar moves into mid-May. Inventory levels are being managed down from a high of 76 units in Period 11 to the current 14 units on-hand. In-transit inventory of 61 units consists of orders from Periods 1 and 3 (totaling 53 units), which are confirmed long-lost, and Period 4 (8 units), which is also overdue. Effective pipeline inventory is essentially zero. Lead times for successful deliveries (P5, P7, P8, P9) have averaged 1.25 periods, shorter than the promised 2. Demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) has averaged 22 units, confirming the drop from the P6-P9 peak of ~35. With May temperatures rising, demand for knitwear is expected to stay low or continue softening. I will set L to 1 (actual) and use the last 4 periods (N=4) to define the current demand regime, allowing the system to target a base stock that covers the roughly 22-unit weekly demand without over-ordering into a declining season.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater, which is entering a low-demand phase as the calendar moves into late May (summer season in the Northern Hemisphere). Current demand for Period 10-14 has averaged 21 units/week, a significant drop from the spring peak of 35.5 units. On-hand inventory is now 0. In-transit inventory shows 61 units, but historical data shows orders from Period 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 61 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. The actual lead time has stabilized at 1.0-2.0 periods based on recent successful deliveries (P8 arrived in P10). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this instability. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (Periods 10-14) to capture the current lower demand regime (avg ~21). This will trigger a reorder to cover the current stockout while accounting for the lower seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 4 (P10-P14): Post-peak demand has stabilized at ~21 units/week (Range 14-32). Pipeline inventory of 61 units consists entirely of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a textured cotton-blend sweater, which is seeing a seasonal decline in demand (Regime 4) as late spring moves toward summer. Historical demand for the last 6 periods (P10-P15) has averaged 20.8 units/week. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The in-transit inventory of 75 units includes 61 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are definitively lost/indefinitely delayed, plus 14 units ordered in P15. The OR backend needs to be instructed to ignore these lost units because it subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. By setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 20.8 * (1+L) plus an adjustment for the 61 lost units, we can force an order that compensates for the phantom inventory. Specifically, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. With L=2, target = 3 * 20.8 = 62.4 units. Since pipeline (75) > target (62.4), the OR would order 0. To fix this, I set mu_hat explicitly to encompass the expected demand plus the lost pipeline volume (62.4 + 61 = 123.4). Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility in Regime 4 (std ~ 6.5, scaled by sqrt(1+L)).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. The product is a 'textured cotton-blend knit' sweater, which is entering a low-demand summer season (confirmed by the drop in demand from the ~35 range in April to ~21 in May/June). Demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaged 19.2 units. Recent demand samples are: 32, 14, 17, 20, 13. The pipeline inventory (127 units) is heavily distorted by lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (61 units total). Actual in-transit inventory that has a chance of arriving is 127 - 61 = 66 units (ordered in P15 and P16). Lead times for successful deliveries have been erratic (1-2 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average valid arrivals. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the stabilized lower demand of ~19 units/week, which accounts for the seasonal shift into summer. Setting these parameters helps the OR engine ignore the 'phantom' pipeline stock by targeting the current lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 5 (P12-P16): Summer demand for knitwear has stabilized at a lower mean of ~19 units/week (down from peak of ~35 during spring). Pipeline inventory contains 61 units of confirmed lost stock from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The product is a cotton-blend sweater (knitwear), which is now in its seasonal low (summer). Demand has stabilized at a lower level, with the last 6 periods averaging ~17 units/week (Range 10-32). Period 17 demand was only 10 units, confirming the cooling trend. Current on-hand inventory is 56 units, which covers more than 3 weeks of the current demand rate (~17 * 3 = 51). The in-transit inventory of 61 units consists entirely of lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (22, 31, and 8 units respectively), which have been overdue for over 13 periods; these must be ignored. I will set L=1 (explicit) to reflect recent delivery performance (P16 arrived in 1 period, P15 in 2) and to effectively bypass the 'lost' pipeline inventory. mu_hat is set to (1+1)*17 = 34 to match the current summer demand regime.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. The product is a cotton-blend sweater, which is in a low-demand summer phase. Demand over the last 7 periods (P12-P18) has averaged 18.4 units, confirming the 'Summer' regime identified in carry-over insights. Recent demand (P17: 10, P18: 23) reflects typical volatility around this mean. Regarding lead times, the most recent deliveries (ordered P15 and P16) arrived in 1 and 2 periods respectively, confirming the system's promised lead time (L=2) is currently reliable for new orders. However, there is a persistent accounting issue: 61 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are permanently lost and occupy the pipeline inventory. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit) to calculate orders, these 61 ghost units will prevent the system from placing new orders unless the base_stock targets are set very high. To bypass this, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. At a mean of ~19 units/period, the base stock should be roughly 57-60 units. However, to trigger an order despite the 61-unit ghost pipeline, mu_hat must be set significantly higher to convince the OR engine that the 'required' stock exceeds 'on-hand (33) + pipeline (61)'. Currently, inventory (94 total) is sufficient to cover summer demand, so I will set mu_hat to 60 (3 * 20) and sigma_hat to 15 to maintain a steady state without over-ordering into the summer trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for the cotton-blend sweater (Sally Structure TVP) continues to decline as the season moves into summer. The last 3 periods show demand of 10, 23, and 4 (average 12.3), confirming the downward trend from the previous regime average of ~19 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 29 units, which is sufficient for roughly two more periods of this low-level demand. The 'In-transit' quantity of 61 units (ordered in P1, P3, and P4) is confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed, as noted in previous insights. Because the OR backend subtracts the pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, and these 61 units will never arrive, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to effectively nullify the fake pipeline in the order formula. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the 61 phantom units. With L=2 and a forecasted weekly demand of ~13, mu_hat = (1+2)*13 + 61 = 100. This should trigger a small replenishment order only when real on-hand stock drops below current forecasted needs, while accounting for the dead 'in-transit' units that would otherwise block all ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 6 (P17-P19): Summer demand has dropped further to an average of ~12 units/week (down from previous regime of ~19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01 (Mid-summer). The SKU is a cotton-blend knit sweater, which is currently in its off-season. Demand has significantly decreased: the last three periods show demand of 4, 10, and 5 units (avg ~6 since P17). The Carry-over insight for Period 20 confirms this regime shift. Pipeline inventory is currently 83 units, but history confirms that 61 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are effectively lost/dead stock. Net 'active' pipeline is therefore (83 - 61) = 22 units, which were ordered in Period 20. Adding the on-hand inventory of 24 units, we have 46 active units against a demand forecast of roughly 6-10 units per week. This is sufficient to cover the promised lead time of 2 periods plus a safety buffer. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this summer lull, and L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual logistical performance observed recently.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, reflecting a summer demand regime for this textured cotton-blend sweater. Historical data shows demand has significantly cooled since the spring peak (~35 units/week in April), stabilizing at approximately 12 units/week over the last 5 periods (P17-P21). Current on-hand inventory is 12 units, with a pipeline of 83 units. Crucially, 61 units of this pipeline (from orders in P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost/overdue and will likely never arrive, as documented in several carry-over insights. The remaining 22 units in transit (ordered P20) are expected to arrive imminently, given the average actual lead time observed recently is 1-2 periods. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the empty 61 units as 'available' to meet demand (which would suppress necessary orders), I must adjust mu_hat or L. Since the product is in a seasonal low (summer), and holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, overstocking is riskier than slight understocking. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent demand regime (N=5, covering P17-P21) to capture the current ~12 unit average, and use L='calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period lead time fluctuation.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, mid-summer. The product is a knitwear sweater (jumper) which is currently in its low-demand season. Recent demand from Period 20 to 22 was 5, 12, and 21 respectively, with the jump to 21 occurring in the final week. However, the 6-period moving average (P17-P22) is approximately 12.5 units/week. The summer regime identified in the carry-over insights (since P20) remains the most relevant anchor, although we must stay prepared for early pre-fall interest. On-hand inventory is 13 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 61 units consists of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4; since the OR backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that offsets these phantom units to ensure the OR engine actually places an order. I will target a base stock level of roughly 40 units (covering 3 weeks of demand at ~13 units/week) + 61 phantom units = 101. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P20-P22) mean is 12.6 units/week; however, the pipeline inventory (61 units) remains comprised of lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22. Demand for this cotton-blend sweater has been in a low-demand summer phase. Over the last 4 periods (P20-P23), demand was 5, 12, 21, and 13 (mean = 12.75). The pipeline inventory of 100 consists of 61 units confirmed lost (from P1, P3, P4) and a fresh order of 39 units from P23. Since on-hand is 0 and the 39 units from P23 are not expected until P25 (promised L=2), we are currently out of stock. Lead times have been fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.5). I will use a recent window of 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current low summer demand regime (~12.75 units/period) while acknowledging the high volatility (sigma). I set L to 'calculate' to let the engine follow the observed delivery patterns, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the most recent summer sales behavior.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/29 (late summer). The product is a knitwear jumper, which follows a seasonal demand pattern: higher in spring, dipping significantly in summer. The current demand regime (starting P20) averages ~10.5 units/week (last 5 periods: 12, 21, 13, 5, 11 - assuming the 11 from user input or recent history context). The pipeline inventory of 100 units includes 61 units confirmed as lost from P1, P3, and P4 (as noted in carry-over insights). Subtracting these lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 39 units (ordered in P23). This P23 order is expected to arrive during P25 (lead time 2). For \u03bc\u0302, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand summer trough. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time (1-2 periods) observed for successful deliveries, and \u03c3\u0302 uses recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 61 units of confirmed lost stock from P1, P3, and P4; these should be ignored when assessing effective supply.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 5th, 2019. The product is a sweater (knitwear), which is highly seasonal. We are currently at the tail end of the summer demand lull, where demand since Period 20 has averaged approximately 11 units/week (Range: 4-21). However, as we approach late August and September, we must anticipate the fall seasonal ramp-up. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 100) includes 61 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are permanently lost/stale, and 39 units ordered in Period 23 which are now overdue (L=3+ vs promised L=2). Effective pipeline is currently 0, and on-hand is 0. Recent demand data shows a slight uptick to 19 in Period 25. Given the low holding cost ($1) and the high profit ($4) relative to the lost sales penalty, more safety stock is warranted for the upcoming season. However, because the backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline) subtracts the full 100 units in-transit (even the lost ones), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or adjust L to account for the supply gap. I will set a slightly higher L and mu_hat to account for the lost stock and the anticipated fall recovery.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed that 'In-transit' includes 61 units of permanently lost stock (P1, P3, P4) and 39 units (P23) currently overdue beyond the promised L=2. Total effective pipeline is 0 despite 'In-transit' totaling 100.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/12. We are in a summer demand regime for knitwear, although demand in P26 spiked to 36 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (P21-P25) of 10.4 units, likely due to a clearing of backorders once the P23 shipment arrived. The P23 order (39 units) finally arrived in P26 with an actual lead time of 3 periods, confirming the supply chain instability. Total In-transit is 81 units, but 61 of these (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed permanently lost. The remaining 20 units were ordered in P26. Effective pipeline inventory is therefore 20. Current on-hand is 3. To maintain service levels given the recent spike and lead time uncertainty, I am setting L to 3 (observed actual lead time) and mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the recent demand volatility and potential start of pre-autumn demand interest, while avoiding over-indexing on the single P26 spike which was likely inflated by fulfilled backlogged demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Effective pipeline inventory remains 20 units (from P26). The 61 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Lead time shift to 3 periods confirmed by P23 arrival in P26.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/19. Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 27 (67 units), likely indicating the start of a late-summer/pre-fall seasonal shift for knitwear as customers begin to prepare for cooler weather. The current in-transit inventory of 104 units includes 61 units confirmed lost from P1, P3, and P4, and 43 units of live pipeline (20 units from P26 + 23 units from P27). On-hand inventory is 0. Lead time has been inconsistent, but P23 recently arrived with L=3, so I will budget for L=3 to be safe. Given the recent demand jump, I am shifting mu_hat to reflect the last 3 periods (average ~40 units) to capture the accelerating trend. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=3) to focus on this new high-demand regime, while setting L explicitly to 3 to account for observed supply delays and to ensure the base stock calculation covers the necessary periods of future demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: Demand jumped to 67 units from a summer average of ~13, likely signaling the start of the autumn purchase cycle for knitwear. Effective pipeline inventory is total in-transit minus 61 units (lost).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/26, which marks the start of the autumn retail season for knitwear. Period 27-28 demand (67 and 68 units) confirms a significant regime shift from the summer average of ~13 units. We are now in a high-demand autumn regime. Regarding the supply chain: observed lead times recently drifted to 3 periods (P23 arrived in P26). Pipeline inventory is '185', but we must subtract the 61 units confirmed lost (from P1, P3, P4) and the P23 order which already arrived, leaving 124 units (from P26, P27, P28). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed delays and set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the new high-demand autumn regime (avg 67.5). I include sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=2 to accommodate the increased volatility of this new phase. This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) reflects the current demand spike and lead time reality.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed starting Period 27: Average weekly demand increased from ~13 to ~67 units (+415%). Lead time for non-lost orders is currently averaging 3 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a cotton-blend jumper (knitwear), which is entering its peak autumn season as of early September (Period 30). Demand has undergone a massive regime shift starting Period 27, jumping from a summer average of ~13 units to a 3-week average of 64.7 units (67, 68, 59). Lead times have been unstable, but recent successful deliveries suggest an actual lead time of 3 periods (P23 arrived in P26). Pipeline integrity is a major concern: 'In-transit' currently shows 254 units. However, 61 of these units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and never arrived. Removing those, we have an effective pipeline of 193 units (from P26, P27, P28, P29). Since these orders are still within the observed 3-period lead time window, we must wait for their arrival. mu_hat is set to reflect the new autumn demand regime (64.7 * 4 = 258.8) using recent_N=3. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to account for higher volatility during this high-demand ramp-up.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand averaged 64.7 units/week over P27-P29 (+400% vs summer). Effective pipeline inventory calculation: total In-transit minus 61 units (lost from P1, P3, P4).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Sally Structure TVP' (knitwear/sweater) has entered a major autumn peak. Period 30 saw massive demand (145 units), following a sustained increase (67, 68, 59) starting in late August (Period 27). This indicates the 'Autumn Demand Regime' is even more volatile and aggressive than the initial observations suggested. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P27-P30) is approximately 85 units/week. Lead times are fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (P27 arrived in 3, P28 arrived in 2). I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly to capture this seasonality and prevent stockouts during the peak. The 'In-transit' of 180 includes 61 units of permanently lost stock (P1, P3, P4), which the backend OR must ignore; setting L to 'calculate' or 'explicit' helps the backend evaluate lead time, but since I cannot directly subtract lost units from pipeline, I will use a larger mu_hat to force necessary ordering. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the current autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified at Period 30: Weekly demand reached 145 units, bringing the P27-P30 average to ~85 units/week (+140% vs the initial autumn estimate of ~35). Lead time remains unstable between 2-3 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak autumn demand phase for knitwear (September), with demand in the last two periods spiking to 145 and 152 units. The average demand over the last four periods (P28-P31) is approximately 106 units per week. Given the seasonal nature of the 'Sally Structure TVP' sweater, we expect high volatility and potential for even higher peaks before cooling in winter. The 'In-transit' inventory of 332 units includes 61 units of long-confirmed lost stock from P1, P3, and P4, which must be ignored. Effective pipeline is therefore 271 units (P29 order of 69, P30 order of 30, and P31 order of 152). Lead times for recent successful deliveries (P27, P28) were 3 and 2 periods, so we maintain L=2 as the base but use mu_hat to cover the higher recent mean. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current autumn demand regime (avg ~106) and provide enough stock for the OR engine to buffer against the ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak intensified at Period 30: Weekly demand for the last 4 periods (P28-P31) has averaged 106 units, a sharp increase from the initial autumn onset. The 61 units from P1, P3, and P4 remain permanently lost and must be excluded from effective pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $728.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a cotton-blend jumper, currently in its peak autumn/winter demand phase (late September). Demand has escalated significantly, from ~67 units/week in late August to 193 units in the most recent period. The average demand over the last four periods (P29-P32) is approximately 137 units. However, given the sharp upward trend (59 to 145 to 152 to 193), a more aggressive forecast is needed to prevent stockouts. Lead times for recent successful deliveries have varied between 1 and 3 periods (P28 arrived in 2, P30 in 2, P31 in 1). I will use L=2 as a baseline for the calculation. The 'In-transit' figure of 208 units includes 61 units confirmed as permanently lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (as noted in carry-over insights), plus the 69 units from P29 which are now overdue (L=3+), and 58 units from P32. The effective pipeline to meet future demand is highly questionable. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current 4-week average projected across (L+1) periods (3 * 137 = 411), but adjusted slightly higher to capture the continued momentum of the autumn peak. Sigma_hat is set high to handle the extreme volatility seen in recent weeks.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter peak intensifies (Late Sept): Demand reached 193 units (P32), with the 4-week average (P29-P32) sitting at 137 units. Supply chain reliability remains a concern; 'In-transit' consistently includes 61 units of lost stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '516903005' (knitwear jumper) is in a massive autumn/winter demand spike. Demand in Period 33 reached 594 units, a nearly 300% increase over the previous week (193). The seasonal peak is clearly accelerating as we enter October. My current strategy is to chase this momentum while properly accounting for supply chain constraints. 'In-transit' shows 451 units, but 61 units are confirmed lost from P1/P3/P4, leaving an effective pipeline of 390 units (from P32 and P33 orders). We currently have zero on-hand inventory and were unable to satisfy the 594-unit demand last period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the explosive growth (averaging ~313 units/week), and set L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the recent faster arrivals (P31 arrived in 1 period, P30 in 2), while maintaining a buffer against historical instability. This will force a significant order to cover the (L+1) window of ~940 units against the effective 390 pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 7 (P30-P33): Exponential autumn growth confirmed. Weekly demand surged from 145 (P30) to 594 (P33), shifting the local mean to ~270+ units. Effective pipeline consistently excludes 61 lost units from Periods 1, 3, and 4.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the autumn/winter peak for knitwear (October 7th). Demand is extremely volatile: it reached 594 in P33 and then dropped to 147 in P34, though this drop likely reflects lost sales and stockouts rather than a cooling trend. Looking at recent behavior (P30-P34), the average demand is ~246 units. Lead times have been fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=2 (promised) as a baseline but maintain a high base stock to account for this variability. The 'In-transit' figure of 1166 includes 61 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is therefore 1105 (Orders from P29, P32, P33, P34). Current on-hand is 0. To capture the current high-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which reflects the period since the autumn surge began. The OR backend will compute a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 8 (P30-P34): Mean demand during the autumn peak has settled at approximately 246 units/week, characterized by extreme volatility (SD ~200+). Effective pipeline consistently excludes 61 lost units from Periods 1, 3, and 4.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak autumn/winter season (October) for knitwear. Demand remains extremely high and volatile, with recent demand points of 594, 147, and 164. The current 4-period mean (P32-P35) is 274.5 units, which is consistent with the established 'Regime 8' described in carry-over insights. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: 'In-transit' is 1108 units, but this includes 61 units permanently lost from P1, P3, and P4. The remaining 1047 units are orders from P33 (243) and P34 (715), which are currently at L=2 and L=1 respectively. With a confirmed actual lead time ranging from 1 to 3 periods, these large orders are expected to arrive imminently. To avoid massive over-ordering while maintaining service levels during this high-demand period, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current mean of ~275 units/week. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the recent variability in delivery (1-3 periods).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. We are in the peak demand season for knitwear ('Sally Structure TVP Jumper'). Demand has shown high volatility in recent weeks (P33: 594, P34: 147, P35: 164, P36: 116). The 4-period average (P33-P36) is 255.25 units. Actual lead times for recent successful deliveries (P32, P33) have been 3 periods, confirming a drift from the promised 2. The pipeline inventory 'In-transit' of 893 units includes 61 units permanently lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4, and 715 units ordered in P34 (which should arrive in P37 based on L=3). To avoid over-ordering while maintaining service levels during this volatile peak, I will set L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat based on the recent 4-period average (recent_N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing the massive P33 outlier. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current extreme volatility (SD ~228).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 8 (P33-P36) mean demand during autumn peak is ~255 units/week with high volatility (SD > 200). Lead time is confirmed at 3 periods for recent arrivals (P35, P36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late October/early November period (P38). Historically, for knitwear in this region, this is the deep autumn peak. Current demand (P33-P37) shows high volatility following a massive outlier in P33 (594). Excluding the extreme P33 spike, mean demand over the last 4 periods (P34-P37) is approximately 148 units/week. However, the OR engine's 'base_stock' must cover (L+1) periods. Recent actual lead times are confirmed at L=3 (P32, P33, P35, P36 arrivals all showed 3-period lead times). Pipeline inventory is 1276, but 61 units from P1, P3, and P4 are permanently lost, making the effective pipeline 1215 units. Given on-hand is 0 and demand is highly volatile (SD ~200 during this regime), I set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent high-volume regime (approx 200 units/week over 4 periods) and use a high sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock given the frequent stockouts and supply instability. L=3 is used to match observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for successful deliveries has shifted from the promised 2 to an actual 3 periods (confirmed by P32, P33, and P35 arrivals). Effective pipeline inventory must always exclude the 61 units lost in Periods 1, 3, and 4.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (Knit Jumper) is in its peak autumn/winter demand phase (early November). Recent demand exhibits high volatility around a mean of approximately 140-160 units (P35-P38: 164, 116, 166, 139). While Period 33 saw a massive outlier of 594, recent data suggests a stabilized high-demand regime. Effective pipeline inventory management is critical: 'In-transit' is 904, but 61 units (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost. The remaining 843 units include orders from P34 (715 units), P36 (28 units), and P37 (recently arrived P38 START). Lead time has been inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P37 order arrived in 1 period, while P32/P33/P35 took 3). I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering given the massive P34 incoming shipment. I'll use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the post-spike stabilized mean (~146 units/week) and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 9 (P35-P38): Peak demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~146 units/week following the extreme P33 outlier. Pipeline inventory calculation must continue to exclude the 61 units lost in P1, P3, and P4.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a knitwear jumper, currently in the peak autumn/winter season (Period 40, mid-November). Demand analysis: After the extreme outlier in Period 33 (594 units), demand has stabilized into Regime 9 (P35-P39) with a mean of 131.6 units/week (164, 116, 166, 139, 73). The drop to 73 in P39 might signal a downward trend, but given the season, we must remain prepared for high volume. Supply analysis: Total in-transit is 876. Subtracting the 61 permanently lost units (P1, P3, P4) leaves an effective pipeline of 815 units. This includes a massive order of 715 units from P34 that is now overdue (actual L=6+ if it ever arrives), while more recent orders like P37 (383 units) arrived in 1 period. This indicates extreme lead-time variance. I will set L to 3 (observed recent lag) and use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand mean of ~132 units while allowing the OR engine to account for the high standard deviation (approx 38 in the last 5 periods). With current on-hand (199) and the effective pipeline (815), we are well-covered for the next (L+1) periods, so the OR backend will likely order minimally or zero.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 10 (P35-P39): Post-peak stability at ~132 units/week; P39 demand (73) suggests potential entry into late-season deceleration. Supply chain Bifurcation: Recent orders arrive in 1-3 periods, but P34 (715 units) is currently 6 periods overdue, suggesting a potential bulk shipment delay or second lost-batch scenario.

Period 34 (715 units) is now 7 periods overdue, confirming it as a second batch of lost or indefinitely delayed inventory alongside the 61 units from P1, P3, and P4. Total 'In-transit' is 876 units, but the reliable pipeline is effectively 100 units (876 - 61 - 715). Since current on-hand (116) plus reliable pipeline (100) covers ~2.7 periods of current demand (78/week), and lead times have fluctuated between 1-3 periods, I am setting L to 3 to reflect recent volatility and using recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the late-season deceleration while maintaining sufficient stock.

Carry-over insight: Second major supply failure confirmed: Period 34 order (715 units) is 7 periods overdue (L=2 promised) and likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Effective pipeline inventory must exclude both the initial 61 lost units and the 715 units from Period 34.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 25. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak autumn/winter pattern, averaging 76 units/week over the last three periods (P39-P41: 73, 83, 74). This is a significant decrease from the extreme volatility seen in Oct. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' total of 876 units is highly misleading. It includes 61 units from P1-P4 and 715 units from P34 (ordered Sept 30, now 8 periods overdue), all of which are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed per carry-over insights. The remaining 100 units in transit (876 - 61 - 715) consist of orders from P36 (now arrived), P37 (now arrived), and P38 (11 units). Thus, the effective pipeline is nearly zero. With on-hand inventory at 42 units, we are at risk of a stockout if demand persists at ~75 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent stable lower demand regime (avg ~88) while acknowledging the downward trend. I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent delivery delay for successful shipments, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the reduced volatility compared to the earlier peak.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2. We are in the late autumn/early winter season for this knitwear product. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak deceleration phase (Regime 10). The average demand over the last 4 periods (P39-P42) is 67.25 units, significantly lower than the October peak of ~250. Supply chain analysis: On-hand is 3. Total in-transit is 876. However, this includes two major failures: 61 units from P1/P3/P4 and 715 units from P34. Both are far beyond any observed lead time (P34 is now 9 periods overdue vs. promised L=2). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 876 - 61 - 715 = 100 units. These 100 units come from the order in Period 42 (though the history shows 'ordered=0' for P42, the in-transit logically must contain recent attempts to replenish or the last successful order P38/P39). Actually, looking at the stock, P38 (11 units) and P37 (383 units) have arrived. The 100 units in transit likely represent the most recent parameters applied. Given the 68% drop from peak demand and the massive 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current 67 units/week trend. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed in successful deliveries (P36, P37, P39).

Carry-over insight: Demand Regime 11 (P39-P42): Late-season deceleration confirmed; mean demand dropped to 67 units/week (-50% vs Regime 10). Effective pipeline inventory must exclude 776 total units (61 from P1-4 and 715 from P34) which are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a textured cotton-blend knit jumper, entering the final stages of the autumn/winter season (Period 44, Dec 9). Demand has significantly decelerated from the autumn peak (avg ~250) to a late-season mean of ~58 units/week over the last 5 periods (P39-P43). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 876 units is deceptive: it includes 61 units lost in early periods (P1, P3, P4) and 715 units from Period 34 which is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. The effective pipeline inventory is 100 units (from orders in P38/P39/P40), but looking at the history, no orders were placed after P38 (ordered 11). Effectively, we are running out of stock with no new replenishment coming in. Given we are at Period 44 of 47, we need to cover the remaining 4 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals fluctuated between 1-3. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the current deceleration (avg ~60), adjusted for (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 12 (P39-P43): Late-season decline continues, mean demand ~58 units/week. Effective pipeline remains total minus 776 lost units (61 from P1-4, 715 from P34).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45, mid-December. The product is a knitwear jumper, which is past its autumn peak and entering late-season decline. Demand has consistently decelerated: Period 39 (73), Period 40 (83), Period 41 (74), Period 42 (39), Period 43 (23), and Period 44 (11). The current mean demand (Regime 12, P41-P44) is approximately 37 units/week, but the most recent two weeks average 17. The supply chain has significant noise: the 'In-transit' total of 876 units is almost entirely composed of lost or indefinitely delayed stock (61 units from P1-4 and 715 units from P34). Excluding these 776 units, the effective pipeline is 100 units (from recent orders). Since effective stock (0 on-hand + 100 effective pipeline) is significantly higher than the projected demand for the next 3 weeks (approx. 51-60 total units), no new order is required. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand levels to prevent further overstocking as the season ends.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 13 (P42-P44): Late-season decline intensified; mean demand dropped to ~24 units/week. Effective pipeline inventory calculation: total In-transit (876) minus 776 confirmed lost units (61 from P1-4, 715 from P34) equals 100 units.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 516903005 (knitwear/jumper) is currently in Period 46 (Dec 23). Historically, knitwear sees high demand in autumn (Sept-Oct) and a secondary peak or volatility around the December holidays. Period 45 showed a significant demand spike (156 units), suggesting a holiday surge following a period of late-season decline. The supply chain remains highly unreliable: total 'In-transit' is 876 units, but 776 of these are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (61 from P1-4 and 715 from P34). The current on-hand inventory is 0. To meet potential end-of-year demand and account for the holiday spike, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent volatility (avg ~57, but biased by the P45 spike) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time of ~2.4 periods observed for successful shipments. Use of sigma_hat recent_N will account for the high variance introduced by the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed at Period 45 (156 units) following late-season decline. Effective pipeline remains total In-transit (876) minus 776 confirmed lost units (61 from P1-4, 715 from P34).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final week of December (Date: 2019/12/30). A holiday demand spike was observed in Period 45 (156) and Period 46 (145), following a period of late-season deceleration. This suggests a brief holiday peak before moving into the deep winter clearance/low-demand phase. The current pipeline inventory visible in 'In-transit' is 876 units, however, 61 units (from P1-P4) and 715 units (from P34) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (total 776 units lost). Thus, the effective pipeline is 100 units (ordered 38 in P38, 11 in P39, plus earlier residuals). Given we are at the end of December, demand is expected to revert to post-holiday lows. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (including the spike) to ensure sufficient stock for any residual holiday demand, but maintain conservative L and sigma settings to avoid over-ordering before the January lull.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed Periods 45-46: Demand averaged 150.5 units/week. Previously confirmed lost shipments total 776 units (61 from P1-4, 715 from P34).
