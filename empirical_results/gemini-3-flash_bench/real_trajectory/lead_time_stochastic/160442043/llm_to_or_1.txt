Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 160442043 (3p Sneaker Socks). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last five weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows values: 29, 32, 42, 38, 37. There is a slight upward trend in January, potentially stabilizing in early February. Mean demand is approximately 35.6 units/week. Since 'sneaker socks' are a year-round staple but demand often increases as spring approaches in the Northern Hemisphere (moving into mid-February), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent mean (~35.6) and volatility. With L=2, the target inventory (base stock) needs to cover 3 periods of demand (current + L). Starting with On-hand=0 and In-transit=0, the OR engine will place an order to reach this level, capped by the safety stock logic.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the Historical Demand Data (pre-game samples), demand for the last 5 weeks has been [29, 32, 42, 38, 37], averaging 35.6. Period 1 demand was higher at 44. The product is Women's Sneaker Socks, which usually sees a demand increase as we move from winter (Feb) into spring. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the Period 1 order (45 units) is in-transit with a promised lead time of 2. It is expected to arrive in Period 3 (L=2) and become visible in Period 4. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend in demand (42, 38, 37, plus the P1 44). The OR backend uses (1+L) * mean, so setting N=3 or N=4 helps capture this shift. I'll stick with N=5 to encompass the known samples plus the new Period 1 data point to stabilize the forecast against the current 0 on-hand status.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019/2/25). The SKU is women's sneaker socks. Historical demand samples (Jan-early Feb) averaged 35 units/week. However, upon starting the game in February, demand spiked to 44 (P1) and 114 (P2). P2 (mid-late Feb) is a massive outlier compared to the seed data, likely signaling the start of Spring season or a promotion. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (promised L=2). The P1 order of 45 units is expected to arrive during P3 resolution (visible P4), and the P2 order of 47 units should arrive during P4 resolution (visible P5). The current pipeline (92 units) is insufficient if demand stays at 114+. I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture the recent spike (average ~79) and setting sigma_hat to explicit to handle the high volatility observed in P2. L remains default until arrival data confirms otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in February: demand increased from ~35 (Jan) to ~79 (range 44-114) in the last two weeks, likely due to seasonal transition to low-cut socks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The product is 'Sneaker Socks', which typically sees a seasonal demand spike as spring/summer weather approaches. Historical demand has shifted from a Jan mean of ~35 to a recent mean of 77.7 (last 3 periods: 44, 114, 75). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 243 units in transit. No orders have arrived yet. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the Period 1 order (45 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible now, but the conclude message for Period 3 shows 'arrived=0'. This means the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. I will adjust the lead time parameter to 3. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the confirmed higher demand regime of ~78 units/period. Over (L+1)=4 periods, this equals a mu_hat of ~312. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed as at least 3 periods (Period 1 order of 45 units did not arrive by end of Period 3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we have a critical stockout (On-hand: 0). The product (Sneaker Socks) is entering its peak seasonal demand as weather warms. Historical demand has shifted from an average of ~35 in January to a higher regime of ~71 in the last 4 weeks (44, 114, 75, 50). Lead time analysis: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (Actual L=2), but the Period 1 order is still missing (In-transit), suggesting potential loss or significant delay. Given the current 0 inventory and high lost sales (only 47 units sold vs 283 units demanded over the last 4 periods), I will maintain the base stock logic using the recent high-demand regime. \u03bc\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher February/March mean. L is set to explicit=2 because although P1 is missing, P2 arrived exactly on the promised 2-period lead time. \u03c3\u0302 is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the high volatility (max 114, min 44) observed in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time remains inconsistent: P2 order followed promised L=2, but P1 order (45 units) is now 2 periods overdue and likely lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/03/18 (Period 6). Inventory is currently 0 with 332 units in transit. Demand in the last two weeks (Periods 4 and 5) has stabilized at 50 units/week, which is lower than the initial February spike (~79), but higher than the January baseline (~35). Analysis of arrivals: The P2 order (47 units) arrived on time (L=2) in P4. However, the P1 order (45 units ordered 5 weeks ago) is 3 periods overdue and is now officially considered lost to avoid under-ordering by counting ghost inventory. The P3 order (151 units) should have arrived in P5 (if L=2) but is currently 1 period late. This confirms lead time is volatile and potentially longer than the promised 2 periods or prone to lost shipments. I will set L to 3 to account for this observed delay. For mu_hat, I'll use the recent demand of 50 units over the last 2 weeks (N=2) to calculate the requirement for 4 periods (L+1=4). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in February.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (45 units) confirmed lost after 5 periods. Lead time volatility established: P2 order took 2 periods, but P3 order is overdue by 1 period.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late March (Period 7), a high-demand season for sneaker socks. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 60 over the last 3 periods (50, 50, 65). Lead time is highly unreliable: P1 order (45 units) is confirmed lost; P2 arrived in 2 periods; P3 (151 units) is now overdue by 2 periods (L=4 if it arrives next period). P4 (136 units) is also in transit. We have 332 units total in-transit, which covers more than 5 periods of demand at the current rate (332 / 60 \u2248 5.5). The OR backend's inventory balancing logic uses the pipeline inventory to reduce the order size. Given the high volume in transit, no new order is likely required, but we must protect against further losses. I will set L to 4 to reflect the current delay of P3, and mu_hat using recent_N=3 (avg=55) to capture the pre-spring demand level. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for P3 confirmed > 3 periods (ordered P3, not arrived by P6 conclude).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (April 1st), the demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' is maintaining a high regime (avg ~64 units/period since Period 3) as the weather warms and consumer interest in low-cut socks increases. The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand and 332 in-transit. Lead time reliability is the primary concern: P1 (45 units) is confirmed lost. P2 arrived in 2 periods. P3 (151 units) was ordered in Period 3 and is now 5 periods old (3 periods overdue), suggesting it might be delayed or potentially lost like P1. P4 (136 units) was ordered in Period 4 and is now 4 periods old (2 periods overdue). Given the history of lost and delayed shipments (P1 lost, P3 overdue), I am setting L to 4 periods (explicit) to reflect the operational reality and increase the pipeline safety target. For demand, I'll use recent_N=5 (Periods 3-7) to capture the higher seasonal mean (~63.6 units) and volatility, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for both the increased demand and the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for P3 confirmed > 5 periods; lead time volatility continues with high risk of lost shipments (P1 lost, P3 likely delayed/lost).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '3p Sneaker Socks' is entering April (2019/4/8), where spring seasonality typically drives demand for low-cut socks. Available demand history from February to April shows a consistent regime averaging 63.6 units per week (min 44, max 114). The primary issue is supply chain reliability. Period 1 order (45 units) is definitively lost. Period 3 order (151 units) is now 5 periods overdue and should be treated as lost to avoid under-ordering. The Period 4 order (136 units) is also overdue by 2 periods based on the promised L=2. Combined on-hand is 0, and while in-transit shows 367 units, a significant portion (151 + 136 = 287) is highly suspect. To compensate for this supply instability and capture spring demand, I am setting L explicitly to 4 (higher than promised L=2 to reflect current delays) and estimating mu_hat based on the stable demand regime since Period 1 (~64 units/week). For 5 periods (L+1), this totals 320 units. Sigma_hat is set to accommodate the high demand variance (std \u2248 23.5) across that lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Period 3 order (151 units) is 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost; Period 4 order (136 units) is 2 periods overdue.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for item 160442043 is severely compromised. Since Period 1, only the Period 2 order (47 units) has arrived. The Period 1 (45 units) and Period 3 (151 units) orders are confirmed lost. The Period 4 order (136 units) is now 3 periods overdue (6 periods since ordering), indicating it is also likely lost. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime since mid-February, averaging approximately 74.8 units per week over the last 5 periods (P5-P9: 50, 65, 78, 77, 77). With spring in full effect (mid-April), sneaker socks are in peak season. To address the repeated lost shipments, I am setting L to 5 periods explicitly to account for the observation that orders either take a very long time or are lost, and I will use the recent high-demand regime (N=5) to set mu_hat. This higher L and mu_hat will push the base stock calculation significantly higher to overcome the massive pipeline deficit caused by lost orders not being cleared from the 'in-transit' count by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Supply chain failure confirmed. Orders from P1, P3, and now P4 (136 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed. Demand is stable at ~75 units/week during spring season.

Historically, orders from P1, P3, and P4 were lost or indefinitely delayed (54+ days overdue). However, the 'Period 10 conclude' message reveals a critical development: the P8 order arrived on schedule (L=2) and the P9 order arrived early (L=1). This suggests the logistics bottleneck might be clearing for more recent shipments. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to persistent backlog and lost shipments. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 77-78 units over the last three weeks, which is consistent with the seasonal demand for low-cut sneaker socks in spring. Given the recent successful arrivals, I will revert the lead time parameter L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed performance (2 and 1) rather than the failures of months past. For demand (mu_hat), I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the stable spring demand regime (~77 units). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low volatility in demand, allowing the OR backend to set a tight safety stock while the supply chain stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery detected: Recent orders (P8, P9) arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, contrasting with earlier lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), the SKU (Sneaker Socks) is in a stable spring demand regime. Over the last 9 periods (P3-P11), demand has averaged 74.4 units with relatively low volatility. Supply chain stability appears to be returning: after the cluster of lost orders in P1, P3, and P4, the orders from P8 and P9 arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the P10 order (58 units) is still in transit (ordered in P10, promised L=2, expected arrival in P12 conclude). To maintain availability for the stable demand, I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (recent_N=9) to capture the current regime (~75 units/week). I will use L=calculate to account for the mix of recent successful arrivals and old lost units, and set sigma_hat based on the recent stable period to avoid over-ordering due to early-period volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Average demand from P3 to P11 is 74.4 units/week (\u03c3 \u2248 17), consistent with Spring seasonality for sneaker socks.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the product (Sneaker Socks) is in a peak seasonal window. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 3 (2019-02-25), with an average demand of approximately 74.4 units per week. The supply chain, which suffered severe losses in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (orders totaling 332 units confirmed lost), appears to have stabilized with recent shipments arriving in 1-2 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 390 units in-transit (orders from P10 and likely others). To ensure we capture the current stable demand regime and account for the recovered lead time, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to encompass the stabilized Spring demand data (Periods 3-12). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to weight the recently observed successful arrivals (1-2 periods) against the historical average, effectively bridging the gap between promised and actual delivery performance.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/5/13 (Period 14). The SKU is 'Sneaker Socks', which entered a higher demand regime (~75 units/week) back in Period 3 with the onset of Spring. However, demand in the most recent period (P13) dropped significantly to 38, suggesting a possible shift as we move deeper into May or simply high volatility. The supply chain has been highly unreliable: orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 were lost. While P8 and P9 arrived quickly (L=2 and L=1), subsequent orders placed since P10 (P10 ordered 58 units) have not yet concluded, despite being within or just past the promised L=2 window. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 390 units are in-transit (reflecting cumulative unreceived orders). Given the high loss rate and recent demand dip, I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for demand to weigh the recent drop while maintaining a base for the established spring regime. I will stick to the default lead time (2) as the backend's base, noting that the OR engine's 'cap' logic will naturally restrain over-ordering given the massive 390-unit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in May: Period 13 demand dropped to 38 (lowest since Jan) compared to Spring average of ~75. Supply chain remains unstable: Order from P10 (58 units) is now 2 periods overdue.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), we are seeing continued supply chain instability and high lost-sale risk for the 3p Sneaker Socks. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 14 (82 units) rebounded from the Period 13 dip (38 units), bringing the recent average (N=12, from Period 3 onwards) to approximately 72 units/week with a standard deviation around 18. The supply chain has major reliability issues: orders from P1, P3, P4, and now P10 (58 units, ordered 5 periods ago) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Although P8 and P9 arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 respectively, the long-term unreliability dictates a more conservative L. I will set L=4 (explicit) to account for potential delays and losses, which increases the pipeline coverage. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent_N of 12 (covering the Spring regime) to capture the 72 units/week average. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=12) to capture the current volatility (std ~18).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Supply chain instability continues. Order from Period 10 (58 units) is confirmed lost/overdue (5 periods since order). Lead time estimate increased to 4 to buffer against frequent lost shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442043' (Sneaker Socks) is currently in its peak seasonal window (May/June), as evidenced by Period 15's demand surge to 127 units. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant supply chain distress with multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, and likely P10). The promised lead time is 2, but actual performance is bifurcated between 1-2 periods for successful deliveries and total loss for others. To account for this risk and the current demand spike, I am setting L explicitly to 4 to increase the target base stock, effectively buffering against potential delays and losses. For demand forecasting, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-variance, high-volume demand trend observed in May (averaging ~82 units/week over the last 3 periods), ensuring the OR backend targets a higher safety stock level to minimize lost sales during this high-profit seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed: Demand surged to 127 in Period 15, consistent with late May/June seasonality for sneaker socks. Supply chain reliability remains low, necessitating a buffered lead time (L=4) for safety stock calculations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of June 3, 2019 (Period 17), the item (sneaker socks) is in its peak seasonal window. Demand has spiked significantly in the last two recorded periods (127 in P15, 114 in P16), confirming a summer regime shift with an average demand of ~120 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 546 units in-transit. A critical supply chain observation: the order from Period 10 (58 units) has not arrived after 7 periods and is confirmed lost. Recent lead times for arrived orders were 1-2 periods, but the frequency of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10) is extremely high (~40% loss rate). To protect against these frequent 'infinite lead time' events (lost orders), I am maintaining an explicit L=4 to deepen the safety stock and increase the base stock level. I will use the last 2 samples (N=2) to capture the immediate peak demand (avg ~120), as using a longer window would severely under-forecast the current summer surge.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak confirmed for sneaker socks (late May/June): Demand avg shifted from ~75 to ~120 (+60%). Supply chain exhibits a ~40% shipment loss rate (P1, P3, P4, P10 orders lost).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the summer peak for sneaker socks (late May/June), with demand averaging approximately 113 units over the last three periods (127, 114, 97). The supply chain remains highly unstable with a historical loss rate of approximately 40% (orders P1, P3, P4, and P10 were lost). Although the most recent order from Period 16 arrived in just 1 period, previous volatility and losses necessitate a conservative approach to safety stock. I will maintain an explicit lead time L=4 to buffer against potential future losses and delays, ensuring the base stock level targets the current high-demand regime. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat captures the 113 units/week average of the summer peak, and sigma_hat will be set via recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased variability observed during this seasonal transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product '3p Sneaker Socks' is currently in its summer seasonal peak (June), with demand averaging ~106 units over the last three periods (P16-P18: 114, 97, 108). This is a significant shift from the Spring average of ~75. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 59 units in P18 (stocking out against a demand of 108). The supply chain remains high-risk with a historical ~40% loss rate (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10 all lost), though recent orders P16 and P9 showed lead times of 1-2 periods. To account for both the increased summer demand and the persistent risk of lost or delayed shipments, I am setting an explicit Lead Time (L) of 4. This provides a safety cushion for the base stock calculation (covering 1 + 4 periods of demand). mu_hat is set to 110 units/week (multiplied by 1+L) based on the recent summer peak demand, and sigma_hat is set to 15 (multiplied by sqrt(1+L)) to handle volatility during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand for sneaker socks sustained: Mean demand increased from ~75 (Spring) to ~106 (June, P16-P18). Supplier reliability remains low with a significant loss rate, requiring an inflated L=4 for safety stock buffering.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is '3p Sneaker Socks', currently in the peak summer demand season (June). Recent demand (P16-P19) has averaged 110.75 units/week (114, 97, 108, 124), confirming the previously identified summer regime shift. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: while P16 and P18 arrived quickly (L=1), orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 (140 units) appear lost or significantly delayed (P17 is now 2 periods overdue with no arrival in P19 conclude). Given the ~40-50% loss rate of shipments, I will maintain L=4 as an explicit setting to inflate the base stock and provide a safety buffer against lost inventory. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current summer peak (avg ~111). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a high service level for the peak season while attempting to build a safety cushion against frequent shipment failures.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand for sneaker socks (June) confirmed at ~111 units/week. Supply chain remains high-risk with a ~40-50% shipment loss rate (P17 order of 140 units now likely lost/delayed).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak summer season for sneaker socks (July 1st). Demand has stabilized at a high regime of approximately 111 units/week (P16-P20 average). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed loss rate of ~40-50% (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and likely P17 are lost). To compensate for the high risk of stockouts due to both high demand and frequent shipment losses, I am maintaining an explicit lead time of 4. This 'inflation' of L forces the OR engine to calculate a significantly larger base stock, providing the necessary safety buffer. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current summer peak (avg ~111) while excluding the lower Spring average. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: July demand confirms sustained summer peak regime (P16-P20 avg: 110.2). Supply chain risk remains critical: Period 17 order (140 units) is now 3 periods overdue and confirmed lost, following the pattern of P1, P3, P4, and P10.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8th, in the middle of the 'Summer Peak' demand regime for sneaker socks (late May through July). Demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) has averaged 105.6 units/week, significantly higher than the spring average (~75). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: the shipment from Period 17 (140 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, following a historical pattern where P1, P3, P4, and P10 were also lost (approx 40% loss rate). On-hand inventory is 0. Currently, 596 units are technically 'in-transit', but this includes the confirmed lost units from P1 (45), P3 (151), P4 (136), P10 (58), and now P17 (140), totaling 530 units. The 'effective' pipeline is likely only the P20 order of 66 units. To account for the high loss rate and protect against stockouts during this peak season, I am maintaining L=4 as an explicit buffer (the OR engine uses this for safety stock) and setting mu_hat to reflect the recent summer demand avg (~106) across the lead time + review period. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain loss rate updated: Period 17 order (140 units) confirmed lost after 4 periods, bringing total estimated losses to ~530 units across history. Summer peak demand (P16-P21) holds an average of 105 units/week.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Sneaker Socks', currently in the peak summer demand regime (July). Average demand from Period 16 to 22 is approximately 104 units/week. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern with a high loss rate (~40-50%). Historical data shows that orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 17 were likely lost as they never concluded despite the promised lead time of 2. Recent successful deliveries (P16, P18, P20) arrived in 1-2 periods, but the frequent losses necessitate a higher safety buffer. I will set L=4 (explicit) to inflate the base stock calculation, accounting for the risk of missing shipments. mu_hat will use the recent 7 periods (P16-P22) to capture the summer demand level (~104 * (1+4) = 520). sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. On-hand is zero, and although in-transit is 530, much of that is comprised of long-lost orders (P3: 151, P4: 136, P10: 58, P17: 140), leaving very little 'real' inventory approaching.

Carry-over insight: Summer peak demand (July) remains stable at ~104 units/week (P16-P22 avg). Supply chain remains high-risk with a confirmed ~45% loss rate based on 5 non-delivered orders over 22 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained Summer Peak demand regime (late May to late July), with recent demand samples (P15-P23) averaging 104.9 units/week. The most recent demand (P23) was 128 units, confirming that peak levels remain high. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from P17 (140 units) and P10 (58 units) are confirmed lost, following a historical pattern where ~45% of total units ordered never arrive. To account for this extreme shipment loss rate (not just delay), I am maintaining an explicit L=4 to buffer safety stock, even though arrivals (when they occur) usually take 1-2 periods. This compensates the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic which assumes all in-transit units will eventually arrive. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=9, covering the summer peak since P15) to capture the current mean of ~105 and volatility. The inventory is currently zero with 570 units in transit (comprising several recent orders), but given the high loss rate, replenishment is necessary to maintain service levels for the remainder of the summer season.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the late July summer peak for 3p Sneaker Socks, with demand consistently averaging around 104 units/week (P16-P24). The supply chain remains highly unstable and unreliable, characterized by a near 45% loss rate for shipments (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 are confirmed lost). With an on-hand inventory of 0 and an 'In-transit' figure of 604 units\u2014which is significantly inflated by these lost orders (approximately 530 units are likely never arriving)\u2014the OR backend would normally stop ordering. To counteract this, I am setting L=4 as an explicit buffer to increase safety stock and using an explicit mu_hat set to (1+L) * 104 = 520. This forces the system to recognize that existing in-transit units are likely phantom inventory while maintaining a base stock level sufficient to cover the 2-period promised lead time plus safety buffers for the high volatility observed in both demand and supply.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in early August (Period 26). Demand history shows a summer peak for sneaker socks from late May through July (Periods 15-23), where demand averaged approximately 104 units/week. However, the last two weeks (P24-P25) have seen a slight cooling to ~80 units/week. Given the seasonal nature of sneaker socks, demand typically begins to taper off as the transition toward late summer/autumn occurs. I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (covering both the peak and the start of the taper) to project a mean of ~100 units/week, transitioning down from the peak. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable with a ~45% loss rate (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 were all lost); currently, orders from P23 (40 units) and P24 (34 units) are outstanding. To buffer against these losses and late-period volatility, I am maintaining L=4 (explicit) for safety stock calculation. On-hand is currently 0, with 604 units in-transit (though a significant portion of this pipeline is likely lost).

Carry-over insight: August transition: Demand for sneaker socks is beginning to taper from the summer peak (avg ~104) towards a slightly lower regime (~80 observed in P24-P25). Supply chain loss rate remains high (~45%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in mid-August (Period 27). The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which has shown a distinct summer peak from late May through July (avg ~105-110). Recent demand in Periods 24-26 (82, 78, 43) confirms the expected late-summer tapering as sneaker sock demand typically cools down heading into autumn. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this downward trend (avg ~68), while keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent volatility. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: five orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17) totaling ~530 units have been lost. Most recently, the P23 order arrived in 3 periods, while the P24 order (34 units) is now one period overdue relative to the promise of L=2 (it should have arrived in P26). Given this high loss rate (~45%) and frequent delays, I am maintaining an explicit lead time estimate of L=4. This buffers the base stock calculation to account for the fact that nearly half of the 'in-transit' units visible to the OR engine (currently 564, many of which are definitely lost) will never arrive, preventing the backend from under-ordering based on ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: August Demand Taper confirmed: Demand for sneaker socks has dropped from summer peak (~105) to a recent 3-period average of ~68 (P24-P26), signaling a seasonal shift. Supply chain reliability remains low (~45% loss rate).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-late August (Period 28, 2019/8/19). As established in previous periods, demand for sneaker socks has begun to taper from the summer peak (avg ~110) to a more moderate late-summer/autumn regime. The last 4 periods (P24-P27) show an average demand of 69.75 units. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 are confirmed lost, while recent delivery times have ranged from 1 to 3 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and 564 units in-transit (many of which are likely lost), we must inflate the lead time parameter L to 4 to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation buffers against these frequent shipment losses. We will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current downward trend while maintaining enough stock for the transition.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (invisible sneaker socks) is entering the late August/September transition. Historically, demand for this seasonal item peaked in June/July (avg ~105) and has consistently tapered in August. The last five periods (P24-P28) show a mean demand of 69.4 units, confirming a downward shift from the summer peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this lower volume, ensuring the OR backend reduces order sizes to avoid excess inventory during the seasonal decline. The supply chain remains extremely high-risk with a ~45% loss rate (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and likely P24 are missing). Although the backend cannot explicitly account for lost orders, I am maintaining L=4 (explicit) to inflate the safety stock calculation, which helps mitigate the impact of frequent shipment failures on our service level. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit units from previous periods are significantly overdue/lost.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand taper confirmed: 5-period average (P24-P28) is ~69 units, down from summer peak of ~105 (-34%). Supply chain loss rate remains critical at approximately 45-50%.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a summer peak (~105 units/week) to an autumn taper. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P24-P29) is approximately 68.5 units/week, reflecting this seasonal shift. The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 45-50% (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 were all lost, totaling over 500 units). The order from Period 24 (34 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. To protect against this persistent risk of lost shipments, I am maintaining the lead time parameter at L=4 to inflate the safety stock calculation. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime, and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime: Sneaker socks demand has stabilized at ~68 units/week (P24-P29) following a 35% drop from summer peaks. Supply chain loss rate confirmed at ~45% over 29 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for sneaker socks has transitioned from a summer peak (avg ~105) to a stable fall regime (avg ~68) observed over the last 7 periods (P24-P30). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume accurately. The supply chain remains high-risk with a ~45% loss rate (P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 orders lost). Although the promised lead time is 2, the high frequency of lost shipments and recent lead times (P23 took 3 periods) requires a buffer. I will continue to use an explicit L=4 to calculate safety stock that accounts for the risk of entire shipments being lost or delayed. In-transit inventory is high (564 units), but many of these units are likely from historical lost shipments; however, the OR backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. By setting L higher, I ensure the base stock calculation provides enough of a buffer for the remaining valid in-transit units to meet demand.

The 5-period average (P27-P31) is 70.6 units/week, consistent with the expected taper from the summer peak (~110 units/week). Regarding the supply chain, the situation is extremely poor. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P24 (34 units) are confirmed or likely lost. The in-transit inventory of 564 is heavily inflated by these old, unfulfilled orders. To ensure the OR backend ignores this 'ghost' pipeline and actually places an order, I am setting L explicitly to 4 (buffering against delays/losses) and using mu_hat to reflect the current 70-unit regime. By accounting for a long lead time in safety stock but assuming the actual arrivals will likely remain erratic, this helps maintain a higher base stock level to overcome the stock-out state (on-hand is 0).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '160442043' (sneaker socks) is in a stable post-summer demand regime. Since Period 24 (late July into September), demand has consistently averaged approximately 68.3 units per week (min 43, max 82). The current date is late September, where this lower demand level is expected to persist as sneaker sock seasonality tapers. The major concern remains supply chain reliability: about 45-50% of orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and possibly P24) have been lost or significantly delayed. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a large pipeline of 564 units, but given the loss rate, much of this pipeline is likely phantom. To ensure the backend OR logic maintains a sufficient service level despite these losses, I am setting L to an explicit value of 4 (double the promised lead time) to act as a buffer for the base stock calculation. \u03bc\u0302 is set based on the most recent 9 periods (P24-P32) to capture the stabilized autumnal demand of ~68 units/week. \u03c3\u0302 is also calculated over this recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime confirmed stable at ~68 units/week (P24-P32 average). Significant supply chain loss rate (~50%) continues to require inflated lead time parameters to maintain safety stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
September demand has stabilized at an average of 68 units/week (P24-P32), though Period 33 showed a spike to 101. The transition from summer peak (~105) to autumn stability is consistent. The most critical factor is the supplier's extremely high loss rate (~50% of orders never arrive: P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and now P24 which is 9 periods overdue). To mitigate this, I maintain an inflated lead time L=4. This ensures the OR backend calculates a higher base stock to account for the risk that arriving shipments are few and far between. For demand forecasting, I use recent_N=10 to capture the post-summer stable regime (~68-75 units) while acknowledging the recent spike in variance.

Carry-over insight: September demand stability confirmed at ~68 units (P24-P32). Supply chain risk persists: Period 24 order (34 units) is now 9 periods overdue and confirmed lost, maintaining the historical ~50% loss rate.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has stabilized in a post-summer regime (September/early October). Over the last 11 periods (P24-P34), the average demand is approximately 71 units/week. However, the supply chain is extremely unreliable. The historical data shows a ~50% loss rate for shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P24 are all deemed lost or indefinitely delayed). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 564 units in-transit. Many of these units are tied up in 'zombie' shipments that will likely never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places new orders, I must maintain an inflated lead time (L=4) to account for this supply risk and capture sufficient safety stock. I will use the recent 11-period demand mean (~71) for mu_hat and calculate the standard deviation for that period (~17.5) to set sigma_hat, reflecting the stable but volatile nature of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: October transition: Demand remains stable at ~71 units/week (P24-P34 average) following the summer peak taper. Supply chain risk remains a primary concern with a confirmed ~50% shipment loss rate, necessitating continued safety stock buffering through inflated lead time parameters.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the demand for sneaker socks has stabilized in the Fall regime (post-August taper). The average demand since Period 24 (excluding the P33 outlier) is approximately 68 units/week. However, the most critical factor remains the supply chain loss rate, which is approximately 50% (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P24 orders all lost/long-overdue). This volatility requires maintaining a high safety stock. I am setting L=4 (explicit) to provide a significant buffer for the stock-level calculation, effectively treating the lead time as double the promised 2 periods to compensate for the frequent lost shipments. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N strategy with N=12 (tracking back to Period 24) to capture the stable ~70 unit/week demand trend observed since the summer peak ended. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-10-21. Demand has entered a stable post-summer regime, averaging ~66.5 units/week over the last 13 periods (P24-P36). This follows a significant drop from the summer peak (avg ~104). The primary operational challenge is a persistent shipment loss rate of approximately 50% throughout the game history (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and likely P24 are missing). To mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by these losses, I am maintaining an inflated lead time parameter (L=4) instead of the promised L=2. This compensates for the 'missing' units in the pipeline by increasing the base stock target. mu_hat is set using recent_N=13 to capture the current stable demand regime (October transition), and sigma_hat is also calculated based on this period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: October demand regime confirmed stable at ~67 units/week (P24-P36 average). Supply chain reliability remains a major risk with a documented ~50% shipment loss rate, necessitating continued safety stock buffering through an inflated L parameter.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '3p Sneaker Socks' has stabilized in the September/October period at an average of approximately 67 units/week (P24-P37), following the summer peak. The current date is October 28th. Historically, this product faces a severe supply chain issue with an estimated 50% shipment loss rate (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24). The inventory position is currently critical with 0 on-hand and 564 in-transit (though a significant portion of in-transit is likely lost). To account for the high loss rate and protect against prolonged stockouts, I am maintaining an inflated lead time parameter (L=4) for safety stock calculation, even though the promised lead time is 2. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using the recent stable regime since late July (approx. 14 periods) to reflect the post-summer taper accurately.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Sneaker Socks) is currently in a stable late-autumn demand regime following the summer peak. Demand has averaged approximately 52 units over the last 4 periods (P35-P38), down from the early autumn average of ~68. The primary operational challenge remains the high shipment loss rate (~50% historically); specifically, the Period 24 order (34 units) is now 15 periods overdue and confirmed lost. With 564 units technically 'in-transit' but many likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24), and on-hand inventory at 0, the OR backend must be tricked into ordering. Since the OR engine's 'in-transit' logic assumes all units will eventually arrive, and the capped policy is based on (1+L), I am using 'explicit' L=4 to buffer the safety stock and 'explicit' mu_hat based on the current regime (52 units/week) to ensure the target base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory. This approach aims to restore on-hand availability for the remainder of the year.

Carry-over insight: November demand transition: Sneaker socks demand has stabilized at ~52 units/week (P35-P38) as colder weather reduces seasonal relevance. Supply chain reliability persists at ~50% loss rate, with the P24 order now confirmed lost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), demand for item 160442043 (sneaker socks) has shifted into a low-demand winter regime. Recent demand samples (P35-P39: 51, 46, 58, 50, 30) yield an average of 47.0 units/week, a significant drop from the autumn average of ~68. The most recent demand (30) reflects declining seasonal relevance. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 564 units, but historically ~50% of the units ordered in this game have been lost or indefinitely delayed (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24). Specifically, the in-transit balance is largely composed of these 'ghost' units. To account for this supply chain instability and the high shipment loss rate, I continue to use an inflated lead time L=4 for safety stock calculations. The mean demand (mu_hat) is set to better reflect the current late autumn/winter regime using the last 5 periods (N=5), and sigma_hat is adjusted accordingly to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: November/Winter demand transition: Sneaker socks demand has dropped to an average of ~47 units/week (P35-P39) due to seasonal decline in sneaker/low-cut sock relevance.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (November 18, 2019), the SKU (sneaker socks) is in a deep seasonal decline. Recent weekly demand has dropped to 30 and 28 units, significantly lower than the October average of ~51. The 5-period average (P36-P40) is ~42 units. Supply chain reliability remains extremely poor with a near 50% loss rate and no arrivals since Period 26, though we have 564 units in-transit (some of which are likely lost). Given the seasonal shift toward winter, demand for low-cut sneaker socks is expected to remain low. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this down-trend (averaging ~42 units/week). Despite the high loss rate, I will maintain L=4 as an safety buffer to ensure that if a shipment does arrive, it covers the extended lead time observed in historical successes. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility seen over the autumn transition.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime confirmed: Sneaker socks demand has dropped to ~42 units/week (P36-P40) as of mid-November, a ~38% decrease from the October average (~68).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which shows strong seasonal dependency, peaking in summer and declining significantly as winter approaches. Current demand (Late November) has dropped to a 4-week average of ~32 units (P38-P41), confirming the winter low regime. Supply chain reliability has been a critical issue throughout the game, with a ~50% shipment loss rate (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P24 were lost). Currently, there is a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 564 units, which vastly exceeds the current demand regime (~32 units/week). Given that previous orders have been lost and the in-transit amount is already disproportionately high compared to the seasonal floor, the OR backend must be prevented from placing additional orders that would likely lead to excessive holding costs if they ever arrived. I am using L=4 to maintain a safety buffer against losses, mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods of winter demand, and sigma_hat based on the same period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime confirmed: Sneaker socks demand has further declined to ~32 units/week in late November (P38-P41), marking the seasonal floor. Supply chain risk remains high with a 50% historical loss rate, but current pipeline inventory (564 units) is excessively high relative to demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (early December), the SKU 'Sneaker Socks' is in a seasonal winter trough. Recent demand from P39 to P42 has been low, averaging approximately 31 units per week (30, 28, 22, 45). The in-transit pipeline is extremely high at 564 units, which is far beyond the current demand requirements for the remainder of the game (only 4 periods left). Even with a historical 50% shipment loss rate, any arrival from this oversized pipeline will satisfy demand and risk high holding costs. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=5 covers the shift from ~50 to ~30 units) to prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders. I am maintaining the lead time at L=4 to ensure the safety stock calculation remains conservative, though the pipeline inventory will effectively cap any new orders to zero.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed: Late November/Early December demand has stabilized at ~31 units/week (P39-P42), a significant drop from the autumn average of ~67.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for sneaker socks has entered its winter floor, with an average demand of approximately 31 units/week over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), down from the autumn levels of ~67. The supply chain has a significant historical shipment loss rate (approx. 50%), which led to earlier decisions to buffer the base stock. However, current in-transit inventory (564 units) is extremely high compared to the current low demand environment (31 units/week), even accounting for the high loss rate. If even one large recent order arrives, it will cover many weeks of demand. Given the low-cut nature of the product, demand is expected to remain low through December. Therefore, I am maintaining the lead time estimate L=4 to buffer against potential future losses while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5-period window to reflect the winter floor. No new orders should be triggered given the massive pipeline inventory relative to current demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/16, mid-December. Demand for sneaker socks has reached its seasonal floor (Winter regime), with the recent 5-period average (P40-P44) at ~28.4 units/week. Historical data confirms a significant supply chain issue with a ~50% loss rate (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P24 are all confirmed lost). Although the 'In-transit' figure is high at 564 units, this is a cumulative total of those lost shipments that never arrived; there are no recent open orders. However, with zero on-hand inventory and the game ending at Period 47 (only 3 periods remaining), placing a new order now with a promised lead time of 2 is unlikely to result in sales before the game ends, especially given the history of lost/delayed shipments. More importantly, any large order that might arrive would incur significant holding costs for the remaining inventory. I will set parameters to reflect the current low demand regime (recent_N=5) and maintain the buffered lead time (L=4) for safety stock calculation, though the OR backend will ultimately determine the order quantity based on the pipeline (which it tracks as 564). No new orders are expected to be triggered given the massive (albeit phantom) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor confirmed: December demand average is ~28 units/week (P40-P44), down from ~68 in Autumn. Supply chain 'In-transit' inventory of 564 is comprised essentially of lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P24.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 46 of 47). The product, sneaker socks, is in its seasonal winter floor, with recent demand averaging ~27 units/week (P40-P45: 28, 22, 45, 29, 18, 20). The current on-hand inventory is 0. However, the system reports 'In-transit: 564 units'. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights), this in-transit figure is comprised entirely of lost shipments from periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 17, and 24. These orders are confirmed lost and will never arrive, yet they occupy the 'pipeline inventory' slot in the OR backend's logic. Because the OR engine calculates [Order = Base Stock - Pipeline Inventory], and our pipeline (564) massively exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 27 unit/week demand (Base Stock \u2248 110-150), the backend will order 0 units unless we explicitly override the parameters to account for the 'phantom' inventory. To force an order that satisfies the remaining period's demand, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom 564 units. Specifically, I set mu_hat = 620. This ensures (Base Stock - 564) results in a positive order of approximately 50-60 units to cover the final two periods of the game (P46 demand and P47 demand). L is set to 2 to align with the promised lead time as recent arrivals (though sparse) have returned to L=1 or L=2.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product is '3p Sneaker Socks', which has high seasonal demand in Summer and low relevance in Winter. We are currently at Period 47 (Dec 30), which is the seasonal floor. Recent demand (P44-P46) has averaged 20.3 units/week. Historical supply chain data confirms a ~50% shipment loss rate, with orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, and P24 (totaling 564 units) confirmed lost. These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' figure, which the OR backend uses to calculate future orders. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (660 units) from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders as long as these ghost units are counted. To force a replenishment order despite the technical pipeline bloat, I must provide an explicit L and mu_hat. I am using L=2 (promised) and mu_hat calculated for (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the winter floor rate of ~23 units/week (total 69). The order placed in P46 (96 units) is expected to arrive in P48/P49. No new order is likely needed this period given the seasonal low and the P46 order already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 564 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24), creating a permanent inventory deficit that prevents OR backend from ordering unless parameters are overridden.
