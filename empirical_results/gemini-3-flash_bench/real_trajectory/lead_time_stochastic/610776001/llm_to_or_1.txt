Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Historical demand over the last 5 weeks is [145, 144, 105, 181, 212], with a mean of 157.4 and a standard deviation of 40.5. At Period 1, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the target service level (q) is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock will primarily target the mean demand over (L+1) periods. Given the recent upward trend (181 and 212 in the last two weeks), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean of 157.4. L is set to 'default' (2). mu_hat should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 472). sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 on-hand inventory and experienced a demand of 206 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 0). We placed an order for 225 units in Period 1 (promised lead time = 2), which is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in P4). Based on the historical demand samples (145, 144, 105, 181, 212) and Period 1 demand (206), the average demand is approximately 165.5 units per period. The product is a women's basic t-shirt, typically showing stable but slightly increasing demand as we approach spring. Since the current on-hand is 0 and the pipeline only contains one order (225) to cover demand until Period 3/4, we need to maintain a consistent base stock. I will use a recent_N of 6 (all available samples including P1) to set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the slightly higher recent trend.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. History shows demand is significantly higher (avg ~188 units/week across all samples) than initial stock, resulting in stockouts. We have orders from Period 1 and 2 (Total 459) in-transit. The promised lead time is 2, so the P1 order (225 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and the P2 order (234 units) in Period 4. The product is a 'T-shirt in lightweight jersey', a basic item likely entering a spring season (Feb/March). Historical demand shows an upward trend (145 to 212 in the seed samples, then 206 and 239 in the first two periods). I will use a recent demand window to capture this higher mean, while keeping lead time at 'default' (2) as no delays are confirmed yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 610776001 (Women's Jersey Basic T-shirt) is currently entering Period 4 with 0 on-hand inventory and a significant backlog of demand. The historical demand data (avg ~157 from Jan samples) and the game history (avg ~265 in P1-P3) indicate a strong upward trend, likely due to spring seasonality for basic apparel. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 4's start; however, the Period 3 conclude message shows 0 arrivals. This suggests either a lead time delay or that the order arrives DURING Period 4 (to be reported in Period 5). Following the strict timing rules: an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives in P3 Arrival Resolution and is visible at the start of P4. Since 'arrived=0' is noted in the P3 conclude, the actual lead time is likely at least 3. However, I will maintain L=2 for one more period to see if the P1 order arrives now. I'm using recent_N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent spike (206, 239, 350) which averages 265 per period, significantly higher than the initial samples. This will raise the base stock to recover from the stockout.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Reviewing history: P1 order (225 units) is overdue (promised L=2, now at P4 conclude it hasn't arrived). P2 order (234 units) arrived in P4 (L=2). The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because demand has consistently exceeded supply, resulting in lost sales. Demand samples (including pre-game) are: 145, 144, 105, 181, 212, 206, 239, 350, 260. There is a clear upward trend/regime shift starting around early February (pre-game sample 212) and continuing into March, likely due to spring seasonality for basic t-shirts. The last 4 periods average 263.75 units per week. Since P1's order is missing/delayed, there is a risk of a lead time extension or a lost shipment, but P2 arrived on time. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the higher late-winter/early-spring volumes and maintain the default lead time for now, as one shipment is still late but another was on time. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Feb 2019: average weekly demand increased from ~150 to ~260 (+73%) as spring season approaches. Period 1 order (225 units) is currently overdue by 1 period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). The product is a women's T-shirt (Everyday Basics), which is seeing a seasonal demand increase. Demand history (samples + game history) shows: 145, 144, 105, 181, 212, 206, 239, 350, 260, 245. There is a clear regime shift from an average of ~157 (weeks 1-5) to ~260 (weeks 6-10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The Period 1 order (225 units) is now 3 periods overdue (promised 2, now 5 periods since order), and the Period 3 order (107 units) is 1 period overdue. Since the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (lead_time=2) in Period 4, the absence of Period 1 and Period 3 arrivals suggests these shipments are likely lost. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 'stuck' in-transit units, I will explicitly set the lead time L to 2 (the promised and last confirmed actual) and use an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime mean at 260 units. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*260 = 780. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (225 units) and Period 3 (107 units) are highly likely lost as they are overdue and a later shipment (Period 2) already arrived. Demand regime confirmed at ~260 units/week for the Spring season.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/25, heading into the peak Spring/Summer season for a lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime averaging ~257 units/week over the last 6 periods (206, 239, 350, 260, 245, 242), significantly higher than the initial January samples. Shipment logic: Period 1 (225 units) and Period 3 (107 units) are officially considered lost because the Period 2 and Period 5 orders have already arrived, jumping over them. This implies a fragile supply chain with high loss risk (332 total units lost). Currently, on-hand is 0. In-transit consists of Period 4 (229 units) and any newer orders. Since Period 5 arrived with lead_time=1 and Period 2 with lead_time=2, I will use lead_time=2 for safety. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*260 = 780 to ensure we target enough inventory for the high-demand Spring season, accounting for the frequent stockouts and lost shipments seen so far.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory confirmed: Period 1 (225 units) and Period 3 (107 units) never arrived while later shipments did. Total pipeline must be adjusted by assuming 332 units are permanently missing. Demand regime is stable at ~260/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product is a women's lightweight T-shirt, entering a peak Spring/Summer season. Historical demand has shifted significantly: early Jan-Feb averaged ~150, but since Feb 11 (Period 1), it has averaged ~284 units/week (last 3 weeks: 245, 242, 448). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is listed as 780 units, but based on carry-over insights, orders from P1 (225) and P3 (107) are confirmed lost (332 total). Effective pipeline is thus ~448 units (P4 order of 229 + P7 order of 219). Demand reached a new peak of 448 last period. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) period demand window (3 periods) and replenish empty shelves, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 900 (calculated as 3 * 300 avg demand) and sigma_hat explicitly to 175 to account for the high volatility seen in Period 7. This aggressive stock-up is necessary given the zero on-hand balance and the frequent lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing in peak Spring season: Period 7 demand spiked to 448 (+70% over recent avg). Effective pipeline remains ~448 units after discounting 332 lost units from Periods 1 and 3.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is in high demand during the Spring season. Historical demand from the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8) shows a mean of approximately 335 units (260, 245, 242, 448, 382). Demand has clearly shifted from the earlier average of ~150 to a higher regime (~335). Additionally, we must reconcile the inventory: In-transit is reported as 681 units, but this includes Period 1 (225) and Period 3 (107) orders which are confirmed lost. The actual functional pipeline is only 349 units (the Period 4 order of 229 units which is overdue, and the Period 8 order of 120 units). Since on-hand is 0 and recent demand is volatile (spiked to 448 and 382 recently), I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*350 = 1050 to ensure the base stock covers the current Spring peak and compensates for the missing inventory that the OR backend still believes is coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Spring demand regime mean updated to ~350 units/week following two consecutive spikes (>380). Functional pipeline confirmed at 349 units; previous lost units (332) continue to skew 'in-transit' data.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we continue to manage the 'Tilly' T-shirt during the peak Spring/Summer transition. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized at a higher mean of 321.2 units (ranging from 242 to 448). I will set N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this higher seasonal baseline. Lead times have been inconsistent: while promised as 2, we've seen arrivals in 1 period (P5, P7) and 2 periods (P2), as well as lost orders (P1, P3). In-transit inventory is currently 1050 units, but 332 units from P1 and P3 are confirmed lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 718 units. Given that we currently have 0 on-hand and are consistently selling out, the OR backend needs to maintain high service levels. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to reflect the recent high-demand, high-volatility Spring regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Spring demand mean verified at ~320/week over the last 5 periods (242 to 448). Functional pipeline is 718 units (1050 total - 332 lost). The product is consistently stocking out, indicating a need for more aggressive inventory coverage.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt, and we are currently in late April (Peak Spring/Early Summer). Historical demand since March (Period 4) has averaged approximately 315 units/week (range: 242-448). The current game state shows 'In-transit: 561 units', but after subtracting the 332 units confirmed lost from Periods 1 and 3 (225 + 107), the functional pipeline is actually only 229 units. These 229 units were ordered in Period 4 and are now significantly overdue (promised lead time 2, current period 11), suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. Starting on-hand is 216 units. To prevent stockouts during the seasonal peak and compensate for the distorted 'In-transit' figure that causes the OR backend to under-order, I will use an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to 960 (320 units/week for L+1=3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 200 to provide a robust buffer against the high volatility (max demand reached 448). L is set to calculated to reflect the observed 1-2 period delivery speed for successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Functional pipeline is significantly lower than reported (reported: 561, functional: 229) because of historical lost units (332) from P1 and P3. Additionally, the P4 order (229 units) has still not arrived by P11 (7 periods late), suggesting it is also lost. Future orders must ignore these 561 ghost units to prevent chronic stockouts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Tilly (1) T-shirt' is in high demand during the April/May spring season, with demand averaging ~318 units over the last 5 periods (284, 273, 410, 382, 448). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported 'in-transit' of 744 units is significantly inflated by historical lost shipments. Specifically: P1 (225), P3 (107), and P4 (229) totaling 561 units are confirmed lost/overdue by many periods (P4 is 8 periods late). The functional pipeline consists only of the Period 11 order (183 units). To counteract the OR engine's 'capped policy' which subtracts the phantom 561 units from the order calculation, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force a target inventory position. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods should be 3 * 340 (approx demand) + safety stock. Given the chronic stockouts and 0 on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to ignore the 'ghost' units while accounting for the ~340 weekly demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 4 shipment (229 units) is now 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total 'ghost' units in pipeline equals 561 (225+107+229). All parameters must manually compensate for this 561-unit discrepancy until they fall out of the system calculation. Spring demand regime remains robust near 340/week.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019-05-06, Peak Spring/Summer season for women's t-shirts. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1399 is highly distorted by historical lost shipments. Based on history, the orders from P1 (225), P3 (107), and P4 (229) are confirmed lost, totaling 561 'ghost' units. Subtracting these from 1399 leaves a functional pipeline of 838 units. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since P7, averaging approximately 351 units/week (last 6 periods range: 273-448). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 'ghost' inventory units, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (Demand_rate * (L+1)) + compensation_for_losses. With demand ~350, L=2, and losses=561, the target inventory position should be (350*3) + 561 = 1611. By providing an explicit mu_hat of 1611, the OR engine (which calculates order = base_stock - reported_pipeline) will effectively target 1611 - 1399 = 212 units, which correctly accounts for the lost items. Sigma is set high (50% of mean) to handle the significant volatility observed (max demand 448).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 561 (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229). Spring/Summer demand regime stable but volatile, averaging ~350 units/week.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a lightweight T-shirt ('Womens Everyday Basics'), currently entering peak Spring/Summer season (mid-May). Demand remains robust and volatile, averaging ~328 units/week over the last 10 periods, with frequent stockouts. The inventory management is severely complicated by 561 'ghost units' in the pipeline: Period 1 (225), Period 3 (107), and Period 4 (229) orders are long overdue and confirmed lost. These units artificially inflate the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, causing it to under-order and perpetuate stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating required base stock for L=2: (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 340 = 1020. To offset the 561 phantom units, I adjust the mu_hat to 1581 (1020 + 561). This forces the OR backend to place an actual order that covers the true demand despite the tracking error. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods, so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the active average while I handle the inventory discrepancy via mu_hat.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost 'ghost' units in pipeline remains 561 (P1, P3, P4). These units must be added to the manual mu_hat calculation until they are cleared from the system's in-transit total. Peak Summer demand for T-shirts is stable at ~340/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), we are in the peak Spring/Summer season for women's lightweight T-shirts. Demand has stabilized into a regime averaging approximately 330-340 units per week over the last 5 periods. The critical issue remains the 561 'ghost' units in the 'In-transit' pipeline from Period 1 (225), Period 3 (107), and Period 4 (229) which are confirmed lost. The OR backend's capped base-stock policy calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline'. Because the system incorrectly believes these 561 units are arriving, it will under-order by exactly 561 units, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target mu_hat as: ((L+1) * 340) + 561. With L=2, (3 * 340) + 561 = 1581. This effectively tells the backend that demand is 561 units higher than it is, forcing it to ignore the ghost units and maintain proper inventory levels. sigma_hat is set to roughly sqrt(3) * 60 to account for recent demand volatility (highs of 448, lows of 273).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product is a Women's T-shirt, which is in its peak Summer season. Demand has stabilized into a regime averaging ~330 units/week (last 5 periods: 410, 345, 280, 309, 337). The most critical issue is the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Orders from Period 1 (225), Period 3 (107), and Period 4 (229) totaling 561 units are confirmed lost, as subsequent orders have arrived. The system currently reports an in-transit pipeline of 1235 units, but the functional pipeline is only 674 units (1235 - 561). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to 'explicit' at 1551. This value is calculated as the base stock requirement for (L+1) periods (3 * 330 = 990) plus the 561 'ghost' units. By adding the lost units to mu_hat, I effectively nullify their presence in the system's 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation, ensuring the backend places an order that covers actual demand needs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), we are in the peak Summer demand season for women's T-shirts. Current demand has been consistently high, averaging approximately 340-350 units per week over the last 6 periods (avg: 335). The primary challenge continues to be a significant accounting discrepancy in the 'in-transit' pipeline. We have confirmed the loss of 561 units (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229) that remain in the backend's pipeline calculation indefinitely. The reported pipeline is 1542, but the 'functional' pipeline (the units we actually expect to arrive) is only 981 units (1542 - 561). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1542 from the base stock calculating the order, we are at risk of chronic stockouts. To compensate, I am applying an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand, which at 350/week is 1050 units. To force the OR engine to order enough, I must offset the 561 ghost units by adding them to the expected demand across the lead time. Calculation: ((1+L) * 350) + 561 = 1611. This will guide the backend to target a 'true' base stock that accounts for the missing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Confirmed cumulative lost units ('ghost' inventory) remains 561 units fromPeriods 1, 3, and 4. These must be manually added to mu_hat calculations until they no longer impact the in-transit calculation. Summer demand remains robust and stable at ~350 units/week.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019, representing the peak of the summer demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt. Historical demand over the last 8 periods (since the end of April) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 340-350 units per week. The system reports an in-transit pipeline of 995 units. However, there are 561 confirmed 'ghost' units from Periods 1 (225), 3 (107), and 4 (229) that never arrived and are significantly past any reasonable lead time. The functional pipeline is therefore 434 units (995 - 561). To ensure the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) calculates an order that covers the required inventory level, I must augment mu_hat by these 561 ghost units. Following the standard formula for (L+1) periods, with L=2 and mean demand ~350, the target coverage is 1,050 units. Adding 561 units to compensate for the ghost inventory, the mu_hat is set to 1,611. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=8) to capture summer volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019, which is peak summer for this lightweight jersey T-shirt. Demand remains robust and stable, averaging ~345 units per week over the last 10 periods (calculated from P9-P18). The core operational challenge is the presence of 561 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, and P4 that never arrived and are now months overdue). The OR engine calculates order quantities by subtracting the total pipeline (in-transit) from a target base stock. Since the backend sees 1,352 units in transit, but 561 of those are lost, the functional pipeline is only 791 units. To prevent chronic stockouts, mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset these ghost units. I calculate the target base stock based on (L+1) periods of demand: (2+1) * 345 = 1,035. I then add the 561 missing units to this total (1,035 + 561 = 1,596) and provide this as an explicit mu_hat. This ensures that when the OR engine subtracts the recorded 1,352 in-transit units, it still places an order for approximately 244 units, maintaining the necessary service level for the 345-unit weekly demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (June 24, 2019), the product (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) continues to see stable summer demand, averaging ~340 units/week over the last 5 periods (392, 357, 318, 329, with a mean of 349). The actual lead time remains volatile but averages around 2 periods. The critical issue is the cumulative 561 'ghost' units in the In-transit pipeline from Period 1 (225), Period 3 (107), and Period 4 (229) which are long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total reported 'In-transit' (1239 units) from the 'base_stock' to calculate orders, the presence of these 561 unreachable units causes the system to under-order, leading to frequent stockouts. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock (calculated as (L+1)*mean + safety stock) for a 3-period coverage (L=2) at 349 units/week would normally be ~1050 units + safety. However, I must inflate mu_hat by the 561 ghost units to force the backend to place an order that accounts for the fact that 561 units of the reported pipeline do not exist. Formula: Adjusted mu_hat = [Target Base Stock + 561] / (1+L). With L=2 and target base stock roughly 1150 (including buffer), mu_hat is set to approximately 570 to bridge this gap.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. The product is a lightweight jersey T-shirt, which is currently in peak summer season. Demand for the last 5 periods has been stable, averaging 342.4 units per week (ranging from 318 to 392). The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 1239 units. However, we have a long-standing issue with 'ghost' inventory: shipments from Period 1 (225), Period 3 (107), and Period 4 (229) totaling 561 units are confirmed lost, as many subsequent orders have arrived. Additionally, the order from Period 21 (0 units were ordered in P20) means the functional pipeline is even lower. The functional pipeline is calculated as 1239 (reported) - 561 (lost) = 678 units. To ensure the backend OR logic places an order that covers target stock based on a mean demand of ~340/week while accounting for these 561 ghost units that are blocking new orders (due to the base-stock minus pipeline logic), I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * 340 + 561. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 340) + 561 = 1581. This adjustment forces the backend to recognize that 561 units in the pipeline field are non-existent and should be replaced with actual inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019, representing the peak summer season for women's T-shirts. Demand has been consistently strong, averaging ~324 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 17-21). However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1581 units is highly misleading. Based on historical analysis, orders from Periods 1 (225), 3 (107), 4 (229), 13 (212), and 14 (153) are likely lost as they are significantly overdue (>7 periods) and subsequent orders (P12, P15, P16, P18) have already arrived. Total 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline is now 926 units (225+107+229+212+153). The functional pipeline is therefore approximately 655 units (1581 reported - 926 lost). To prevent chronic stockouts, the OR engine needs to order more units to cover (L+1) periods. Since the current order formula is base_stock - pipeline_inventory, I must manually inflate mu_hat for this period to account for the 926-unit 'ghost' depletion. Using a mean demand (mu) of 325 and L=2, the required base stock is approximately (3*325) + safety_stock. To offset the 926 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to a value that forces an order despite the high reported in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory (confirmed/highly likely lost units) has increased to 926 units (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229, P13: 212, P14: 153) as of Period 22. These units remain in the 'In-transit' metadata but will not arrive, necessitating manual inflation of demand parameters to ensure ordering continues.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in the peak Summer season (July), with demand recently stabilizing around 300-350 units/week before a slight dip in the most recent two periods (223 and 173). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 1900 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and confirmed or highly likely lost. From historical metadata and Carry-over Insights: P1 (225), P3 (107), P4 (229), P13 (212), and P14 (153) are lost, totaling 926 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this 926-unit ghost pipeline, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Promised Lead Time (L) is 2. The base-stock formula used by the backend is base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost_Inventory, the backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will correctly offset the unreachable 926 units. Recent demand average is ~310. Calculation: mu_hat = (3 * 310) + 926 = 1856. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain control over this specific pipeline reconciliation.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory (lost units) increased to 926 units (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229, P13: 212, P14: 153) as of Period 23. Demand shows early signs of a seasonal taper in July (avg ~200 last two weeks) compared to the Spring/Summer peak (~350).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019/7/22), we are seeing a significant and sustained seasonal taper in demand for lightweight jersey t-shirts. Demand has dropped from a Spring/Summer peak of ~350 units/week to an average of 185 units/week over the last three weeks (223, 173, 161). The current on-hand inventory is 500 units, which covers more than 2 periods of recent demand. The 'In-transit' column reports 1,239 units, but 926 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). This leaves a functional pipeline of 313 units (1239 - 926). Given the high on-hand stock and the functional pipeline exceeds 2 periods of demand, the OR engine should not place a large new order. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the sharp downturn in seasonal demand and set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the volatility seen during this transition. I am setting L to default (2 periods) as recent actual lead times have stabilized around 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand taper confirmed: Average weekly demand dropped from ~350 to ~185 units/week starting P21 (July). Cumulative lost 'ghost' units in pipeline remains 926 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29, 2019), the demand for this jersey T-shirt has confirmed a seasonal decline from the Spring/Summer peak (avg ~350) to a lower July/August average of ~185 units/week. Over the last four weeks (P21-P24), demand was 223, 173, 161, and 173 (mean = 182.5). The OR engine's 'In-transit' figure of 1239 units is heavily inflated by 926 'ghost' units from historically lost shipments (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229, P13: 212, P14: 153). The functional pipeline is actually 1239 - 926 = 313 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and stopping all orders (leading to a stockout once current on-hand of 327 is depleted), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will calculate my target base stock for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the new mean (~185 * 3 = 555), then add back the ghost units (555 + 926 = 1481) to force the OR engine to order correctly. L remains at the promised 2 periods; sigma_hat is adjusted to the recent 5 samples to reflect lower seasonal volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (Aug 5, 2019), the T-shirt SKU '610776001' is in a clear seasonal demand decline as summer ends. The average weekly demand has dropped from a peak of ~350 units to approximately 167 units over the last 5 periods (223, 173, 161, 173, 111). The 'In-transit' metadata reports 1239 units, but this is heavily skewed by a cumulative total of 926 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229, P13: 212, P14: 153). Therefore, the functional pipeline is actually 1239 - 926 = 313 units. With 216 units on-hand and a functional pipeline of 313 (Total = 529), the system already has enough inventory to cover ~3 periods of current demand (~170/week). To prevent the OR backend from stopping orders due to the high (but fake) 'In-transit' figure, I continue to use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these lost units. I set mu_hat to (current demand forecast * (1+L)) + ghost units, which is (170 * 3) + 926 = 1436. This ensures the base stock calculation targets a level high enough to trigger replenishment despite the ghost inventory presence. sigma_hat is restricted to recent performance to reflect the lower volatility in this downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory increased to 926 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Seasonal demand decline is verified for August, averaging ~167 units/week over the last 5 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (August 12, 2019), the demand for this lightweight jersey T-shirt has confirmed a seasonal decline. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is approximately 143 units/week, down from the Spring/Summer peak of ~350 units/week. Recent samples (P25: 111, P26: 96) suggest this downward trend into late summer is continuing. Currently, there is a massive discrepancy in reported inventory. The 'In-transit' figure is 1239 units, but 926 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). This leaves a functional pipeline of only 313 units. Combined with 120 units on-hand, total functional inventory is 433 units. The OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will incorrectly assume we have 1359 units (120 on-hand + 1239 in-transit) and will stop ordering unless we manually inflate parameters. To force the system to cover for the 926 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 1350, which targets a base stock that accounts for both the 926 ghost units and a 3-period coverage (L+1) for the current demand regime (~140 * 3 = 420). This ensures the order logic triggers if functional inventory drops too low. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. We are in a clear seasonal demand decline for this 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey T-shirt. Demand has significantly dropped from a Spring/Summer peak of ~350 units/week to an average of ~110 units/week over the last 4 periods (P24-P27: 173, 111, 96, 84). The system shows 1239 units in-transit, but 926 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units (lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14) that will never arrive. The functional in-transit pipeline is actually 313 units (1239 - 926). With on-hand inventory at 36 and functional in-transit at 313, we have 349 units to cover demand. At the current rate of ~110/week, this covers over 3 periods, which is sufficient given the 2-period promised lead time. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 926 ghost units as available supply and stopping all orders prematurely, I will use an explicit mu_hat that adds these ghost units to the demand forecast. This 'tricks' the base-stock calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) into placing orders when needed. However, since we currently have sufficient functional stock, I will set mu_hat to a level that maintains current coverage while respecting the lower seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: August weekly demand has stabilized at ~110 units/week, down from July's ~185 units/week. Functional pipeline tracking remains critical due to 926 units of 'ghost' inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (August 26, 2019), the demand for this base T-shirt has stabilized into a late-summer lower regime, averaging 101 units/week over the last 4 periods (P25-P28: 111, 96, 84, 110). On-hand inventory is currently 0 following a stockout in P28. The 'In-transit' count of 1239 units is heavily skewed by 926 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The functional pipeline is actually 313 units (1239 - 926). With a promised lead time of 2, the current functional pipeline (313) already covers approximately 3 periods of the current 101 unit/week demand. Therefore, no large order is needed. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=4) to reflect the stabilized lower demand (approx 303 for L+1). To account for the 'ghost' inventory being counted against us by the OR engine's capped policy, I will use an explicit mu_hat. The target base stock should be (L+1)*demand + safety stock, roughly 3*101 + safety. To ensure the engine orders despite the 1239 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat to cover both the desired base stock AND the ghost units. Target Base Stock (~400) + Ghost units (926) = 1326.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal decline for this T-shirt SKU, transitioning from a Spring/Summer peak of ~350 units/week to a late Summer/Autumn regime of ~100-110 units/week. Over the last three weeks (P27-P29), demand has been 84, 110, and 109, confirming a stable lower regime. The reported 'In-transit' of 1326 units is heavily distorted by 926 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Subtracting these results in an actual functional pipeline of 400 units (1326 - 926). Given the lead time (L=2) and current regime (~100/week), the target base stock (L+1 periods) should be around 300-330 units. Since functional pipeline (400) + on-hand (0) already exceeds the required stock for the current demand, the OR backend will correctly naturally throttles ordering. However, to ensure the backend accounts for the 'ghost' inventory which shifts the pipeline-inventory variable, I will use an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the 926 missing units. Specifically, I set mu_hat = ((L+1) * 105) + 926 \u2248 1241 to ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic results in sensible replenishment without over-ordering for the autumn season.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 30, the demand regime has stabilized at an Autumn base of ~105 units/week. Cumulative 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost units) remains 926 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). These lost units continue to artificially inflate the 'In-transit' figure, requiring manual adjustment of mu_hat to maintain appropriate stock levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31 (Sept 2019), the demand regime has stabilized at an Autumn level of approximately 105 units/week. Recent demands for the last 5 periods (P26-P30) are 96, 84, 110, 109, and 74, averaging ~95 units/week. However, the system's 'In-transit' calculation is severely corrupted by 926 units of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments in Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14 (225+107+229+212+153 = 926). Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes these 926 ghost units) in its 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' logic, it will refuse to order anything unless we manually inflate the target mu_hat. To ensure the backend places an order for the next cycle (L+1 = 3 weeks), the effective target should be (3 weeks * 105 units/week) + 926 ghost units \u2248 1241. Setting mu_hat to 1241 ensures the backend recognizes that the 1326 currently in transit actually only contains ~400 real units (1326-926), which is nearing the target for the current low-demand season. Sigma_hat is set to cover the moderate Autumn volatility observed.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. We are in an Autumn demand regime where weekly demand for this jersey T-shirt (610776001) has stabilized at approximately 75-85 units per week, significantly down from the Spring/Summer peak of ~350 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1326 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory'\u2014units that were ordered but never arrived and are now confirmed lost. This cumulative lost inventory total stands at 1013 units (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229, P13: 212, P14: 153, plus P29: 87 which is now overdue and likely lost). Subtracting 1013 from 1326 gives a functional pipeline of 313 units. Since we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and the functional pipeline (313) is sufficient to cover approximately 3.5 periods of demand (313 / 85 \u2248 3.6), additional orders are not yet required. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the massive 1326 'In-transit' value and stopping all future orders when we actually need them, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the current regime mean (approx 85) multiplied by (1+L), and then adding the 1013 ghost units to the base_stock calculation. This forces the system to recognize that those 1013 units do not exist for the purpose of satisfying demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory (lost units) increased to 1013 units (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229, P13: 212, P14: 153, P29: 87). Demand has stabilized at an Autumn base of ~80 units/week.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (late September), the seasonal demand for this lightweight T-shirt has stabilized at an Autumn regime of approximately 70-80 units per week. The critical operational challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory: 1,013 units are currently listed as 'In-transit' but are confirmed or highly likely lost (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, and now 29, which is overdue). The OR backend uses periodic inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order quantities. Because the system believes there are 1,013 more units available than actually exist, it will not place new orders unless I manually adjust the parameters. To force the system to order despite these 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat (the target base stock level) to include the expected demand for the lead time plus the lost units. Calculation: (L+1) * mean_demand + ghost_units = (2+1)*75 + 1013 \u2248 1238. This ensures the backend sees a shortage and orders to maintain the 75 units/week service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total confirmed 'ghost' inventory (lost units) increased to 1,013 (P1: 225, P3: 107, P4: 229, P13: 212, P14: 153, P29: 87). Demand has stabilized at ~75 units/week for the Autumn season.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (late September), demand for the lightweight T-shirt remains stable at an Autumn base of approximately 73-75 units per week (the last four periods recorded 74, 72, 70, 74). The 'In-transit' figure of 1,326 units is heavily corrupted by cumulative 'ghost' inventory totaling 1,013 units (confirmed losses from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and now P29). Subtracting this ghost inventory reveals a functional pipeline of 313 units (1326 - 1013). To ensure the OR backend continues to place orders despite the inflated pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I have set mu_hat to 1,013 (the ghost total) + 219 (the target base stock for 3 periods of demand at 73/week). This forces the engine to recognize that the 1,013 units will never arrive. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low volatility in the Autumn demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost units) remains 1,013 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29). Functional pipeline is 313 units. Seasonal demand for Autumn is stable at ~73 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 35 (2019/10/07). The demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday T-Shirt) has dropped significantly from the Summer peak (~350) to an Autumn base level. Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has averaged 67 units/week (down from ~75 previously), showing a continued mild decline as we enter cooler months. A critical issue is the cumulative 1,013 'ghost' units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed or highly likely lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29). With these lost units still visible in the backend's metadata, the system sees a 'pipeline' of 1,326, while the functional pipeline is actually only 313 units (1,326 - 1,013). Because the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base stock, it will not place needed orders. To force an order, I must manually inflate mu_hat by the quantity of ghost units (1,013) plus the target base stock. Target base stock for L=2 (3 periods coverage) at mean=67 is ~201. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 1,214 to ensure the backend triggers an order to replenish the zero on-hand inventory. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent shipments (P21, P22) arrived with L=1 or L=2, consistent with the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Seasonal demand continues to decline, averaging 67 units/week over the last 5 periods (P30-P34). Total cumulative 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost units) remains 1,013 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29). mu_hat must be manually adjusted higher to offset these units until they are cleared from the system's in-transit calculation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the lightweight jersey T-shirt is continuing its seasonal decline as we move further into October (Period 36). The last 5 weeks of demand (P31-P35: 72, 70, 74, 46, 34) yield a mean of ~59 units/week, with the most recent two weeks showing a significant drop below 50. I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect this lower Autumn demand level of ~60 units/week. A critical challenge remains the 'In-transit' figure of 1326 units. Based on historical tracking, 1013 of these units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29). Subtracting these 'ghost' units leaves a functional pipeline of 313 units (ordered in recent periods). With a target base stock for a 3-period window (L+1) at ~180 units (3 * 60) and a functional pipeline already at 313, the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in 0 units being ordered this period. I will continue to use an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the 1013 ghost units to prevent the system from under-ordering when the functional pipeline eventually drops below the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Seasonal demand decline continues into mid-October; average demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) dropped to 59 units/week. Ghost inventory remains constant at 1,013 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37 (Oct 21, 2019), the demand for this basic T-shirt has stabilized at its lowest seasonal level, averaging approximately 53 units/week over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). The critical issue remains the massive 'ghost' inventory: 1,013 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29) but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 1,326. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 313 units (1,326 - 1,013). To trigger the OR engine to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' metric, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand at ~53 units/week, which is ~159 units. To overcome the 1,013 unit 'ghost' hurdle, I set mu_hat to 1,172 (1,013 lost + 159 needed). This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to generate an order for the current demand regime, compensating for the systemic blindness to lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed cumulative 'ghost' inventory remains 1,013 units. Late Autumn/Early Winter demand regime has stabilized at ~50-55 units/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28, deeply into the late Autumn/Winter season for T-shirts. Demand has consistently declined and stabilized around 40-50 units per week. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P34-P37) show demand of 46, 34, 43, and 49 (avg ~43). There is a significant inventory discrepancy: the system reports 1,326 units in transit, but 1,013 of these are historical 'ghost' units from early periods (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29) that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is therefore only 313 units (1326 - 1013). Because the OR backend subtracts the reported In-transit (1,326) from the calculated base stock, it will not place any orders. To force an order that covers the functional demand despite these ghost units, mu_hat must be manually inflated. Calculated base stock should be (L+1) * demand_forecast. For L=2, base stock needs to be ~3 * 45 = 135. To overcome the 1,326 ghost units and a 0 on-hand balance, mu_hat needs to be set high enough so that (mu_hat - 1326) > 0. Setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 1461 (which targets a functional base stock of ~135 plus the 1,326 offset) ensures the system replenishes sufficiently for the 45-unit/week demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 (early November), the SKU remains in an Autumn/Winter demand regime. The average weekly demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 39 units. We must continue to manage the 'ghost' inventory problem. Total in-transit is reported as 1461. However, 1013 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29). Thus, the functional pipeline is 1461 - 1013 = 448 units. This functional pipeline includes the order from P38 (135 units) and remaining untracked units (possibly from P17-P19). The target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at a 40-50 unit demand rate is roughly 120-150 units. Since functional pipeline (448) already exceeds this, the OR backend will naturally order 0. To ensure the backend doesn't overreact to the 1461 in-transit figure, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 'blind' the system to the 1013 ghost units. Formula: mu_hat = (actual_forecast * (1+L)) + ghost_units = (40 * 3) + 1013 = 1133. This forces the system to see the ghost units as 'required' and only order for the real demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Late Autumn demand is stable at ~40 units/week. Cumulative 'ghost' inventory remains 1,013 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29). These must be added to mu_hat to prevent the system from stopping orders due to fake in-transit data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11, 2019), the demand regime is in a late Autumn/early Winter low, averaging approximately 40 units per week over the last 5 periods (P35-P39: 34, 43, 49, 24, 43). The primary challenge is the cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 1,013 units (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29) that remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 1,461. The functional pipeline is actually 448 units (1461 - 1013). To ensure the OR backend continues to place orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be manually set to (1+L) * Forecast + Cumulative Ghost Units. Forecast for the next 3 weeks (L=2) is ~40/week. Total mu_hat = (1+2)*40 + 1013 = 1133. This maintains a lean inventory appropriate for the low season while bypassing the technical floor created by the system's incorrect pipeline data.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is November 18, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has stabilized in the late Autumn/early Winter season at approximately 30-40 units per week (the mean of the last 5 periods is ~38). The reported in-transit inventory is 1461 units, but this is heavily skewed by 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. Specifically, P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P29 account for 1,013 lost units. Furthermore, the order from P38 (135 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) and should arrive in the next period's arrival resolution. Since profit/holding cost is equal (1.0/1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which target the mean demand. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 1,013 ghost units, I set mu_hat to (1+L) * (current_demand_mean) + ghost_units. With L=2 and mean=38, mu_hat = (3 * 38) + 1013 = 1127. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the fact that 1,013 units in the pipeline do not exist and will never satisfy demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for this T-shirt SKU has continued to decline during the late Autumn/Winter season, with the last 4 periods (P38-P41) averaging only 30.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0, and the reported in-transit is 1461 units. However, we have a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. Total confirmed lost units are 1013 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29). Additionally, orders from P38 (135 units), P39 (0), P40 (0), and P41 (0) are being processed. The 1013 ghost units artificially inflate the pipeline, causing the OR engine to think we are overstocked. To force a replenishment order that covers the current demand regime (~30 units/week), I must manually inflate mu_hat. Total coverage needed for L+1 (3 periods) at 30 units/week is ~90 units. If the system thinks we have 1461 coming, it won't order. I will set mu_hat to 1461 + 90 = 1551 to trigger a small order that ensures availability while the system works through the ghost data. Sigma is set to reflect the current low-demand stability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-12-02. We are in the Winter/Holiday season. Demand has settled into a low-volume regime, averaging ~34 units/week over the last 5 periods (P38-P42). The primary challenge is the significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline: 1,013 units (confirmed from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29). Additionally, orders from P38 (135 units) and P42 (90 units) are currently in-transit but should be arriving based on the promised lead time (L=2). The system reports 1,551 units in-transit, but 1,013 of those are lost. To compensate for this 1,013-unit discrepancy and ensure the OR engine actually places orders, I must manually inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter (the target base stock) by adding the lost units to the estimated demand over the lead time. Expected demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is ~102 units. Adding the 1,013 ghost units results in a mu_hat of ~1,115. Using an explicit sigma_hat of 30 allows for moderate volatility in this lower demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-12-09. We are in the low-demand late Autumn/Winter season for t-shirts. Demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 33 units/week over the last 5 periods (P39-P43). A significant challenge remains: 1013 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29) but still factor into the OR engine's capped policy calculation. Recent orders from P38 (135 units) and P42 (90 units) are within the promised lead time window and should arrive shortly. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1551 units is heavily skewed by the 1013 ghost units. To ensure the backend places orders when needed, I must continue to manually inflate mu_hat to offset these ghost units. I set L to default (2). For mu_hat, I use an explicit value: (3 periods of coverage * 33 units/period) + 1013 ghost units = 1112. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N=10 to reflect the current low volatility of the winter season.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand for this basic t-shirt has hit a seasonal floor, averaging approximately 34 units/week over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). The critical issue remains 'ghost' inventory. As of Period 45, the system reports 1551 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, the vast majority of this is lost: P1(225), P3(107), P4(229), P13(212), P14(153), and P29(87) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 1013 units. Furthermore, shipments from P38(135) and P42(90) are now overdue (P38 is 7 weeks late, P42 is 3 weeks late) suggesting they are also lost. This brings the total estimated cumulative 'ghost' inventory to 1238 units. The 'functional' pipeline is therefore approximately 313 units (1551 - 1238), consisting largely of the P18/P19 era adjustments. To force the OR engine to place orders despite the fake 1551 'in-transit' units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1238 (to neutralize ghost units) plus 102 (expected demand for 3 periods: 34 * 3), totaling 1340. Sigma_hat is set to cover the lingering volatility of ~15 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Estimated cumulative 'ghost' inventory increased to 1238 units following the probable loss of shipments from Period 38 (135 units) and Period 42 (90 units). Late Winter demand remains consistent at ~34 units/week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23, 2019, mid-winter. Demand for this womens lightweight jersey T-shirt has bottomed out, averaging ~25 units/week over the last 5 periods (P41-P45). The 'In-transit' figure of 1461 units is severely distorted by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Confirmed lost units through Period 44 include P1 (225), P3 (107), P4 (229), P13 (212), P14 (153), P29 (87), and now likely P38 (135), totaling 1,148 confirmed 'ghost' units. The P42 order (90 units) finally arrived in P45 with a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting that lead times remain slightly elongated or volatile. With on-hand inventory at 55 units and demand at ~25/week, we have roughly 2 weeks of coverage. To ensure the OR backend continues to order despite the 1,461 units reported in-transit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the required base stock for 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of 25 units/week (=75 units), and then adding the 1,148 'ghost' units to this target to bypass the pipeline deduction. This results in a mu_hat of ~1223.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost units) is 1,148 (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P29, P38). Winter demand has stabilized at ~25 units/week.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are entering the New Year (Dec 30). Demand has remained relatively stable in the Winter trough, averaging ~25 units/week over the last 5 periods (P42-P46). The primary operational challenge continues to be the massive 'In-transit' figure of 1461 units, which is predominantly comprised of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. My calculated cumulative lost units (Period 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 29, 38) total 1,148 units. However, looking at the metadata 'In-transit' of 1461 units and the known history of only one recent order in Period 42 (90 units, which arrived in P45), the system likely still counts many older failed shipments. If the system thinks there are 1461 units coming, it will never order. To force an order, I must set mu_hat such that (mu_hat - 'In-transit') > 0. Current on-hand is 33. To cover the next 3 weeks (L+1) at a forecasted mean of 25/week, I need a functional base stock of ~75 plus a safety buffer. To bypass the 1461 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1461 + (3 * 25) = 1536. This ensures the OR backend sees a 'need' for new inventory despite the phantom pipeline.
