Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows an increasing trend: 28, 38, 34, 44, 41 (mean ~37). This SKU is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees stable or slightly rising demand as we move towards spring. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the most recent 5 periods of demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent upward trend compared to the all-time average, while setting L to the promised default of 2 periods to cover the (L+1)=3 week lead time plus review window risk.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a pack of fine-knit trainer socks, which are typically a stable basic item. Historical demand (recent 5 weeks: 28, 38, 34, 44, 41) shows a slight upward trend, averaging ~37 units. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 43, but sold 0 units because the initial on-hand inventory was 0. The order of 48 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and be available for sale in Period 4. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time delay, we need to maintain a steady pipeline. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent slight increase in demand while accounting for the promised lead time of 2 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is women's socks, which generally have stable demand but can be influenced by basic replacement cycles. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are still in transit (Promised Lead Time = 2). The Period 1 order (48 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, making it available for Period 3's demand resolution. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) were [28, 38, 34, 44, 41], with an average of 37. However, the last two concluded periods (P1 and P2) showed significantly higher demand (43 and 66 units). The jump to 66 in P2 suggests a potential upward trend or volatility shift. Given L=2, we need to cover demand for 3 periods (L+1). I will use the last 5 demand observations (including the 2 from game history) to calculate a more responsive mean and set an explicit mu_hat. Mean of [34, 44, 41, 43, 66] = 45.6. For 3 periods, mu_hat = 45.6 * 3 = 136.8. I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on recent volatility to maintain service levels while we wait for arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'Basic 7p Shaftless Fine-knit trainer socks' has shown strong demand over the last 3 periods (43, 66, 57), averaging 55.3 units/period, which is higher than the initial samples (avg ~38). The inventory state is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have 161 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (48 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4, but it hasn't concluded yet. This suggests a potential lead time delay or just the execution order mechanics (an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives in P3 and is seen in P4). However, with demand exceeding supply and zero sales yet, we need to maintain a robust pipeline. I will estimate L at 2 (promised) and use recent history (N=5 total samples available) to project demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the 3-period window (L+1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is basic women's trainer socks. The demand history shows an upward trend since the initial pre-game samples (avg ~37) to the game periods (avg ~52.5). Period 4 saw the first arrival (from Period 2), confirming the promised lead time of 2 periods. The Period 1 order (48 units) is currently overdue; it should have arrived in Period 3 (concluded in Period 4 message). I will maintain the lead time at the promised 2 periods (L=2) but keep a close eye on the P1 order. Demand seems to have stabilized at a higher level than the initial training data. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher gift/early-spring demand seen in the game periods (43, 66, 57, 44), which averages 52.5 per period. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (Fine-knit trainer socks) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Period 5 demand was 43, but only 3 were sold due to stockout. The order from Period 1 (48 units) is overdue and likely lost, as it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4 given L=2. The order from Period 2 arrived on time in Period 4. The order from Period 3 (66 units) was expected in Period 5 but did not arrive, suggesting either a lead time drift to L=3 or another lost shipment. Given the 'socks' category in mid-March, demand is stable but slightly higher than the initial February samples. Recent demand (P4: 44, P5: 43) aligns with earlier samples. I will set L=3 'explicitly' to account for the delay/uncertainty and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the stable mean around 40-45 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Potential shipment loss/delay: Period 1 order (48 units) is missing; Period 3 order (66 units) is delayed beyond promised L=2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/03/25. Demand has increased significantly in the last period (73 units), possibly due to the onset of spring/warmer weather influencing trainer sock sales. Inventory management is currently critical due to severe supply chain instability. Specifically: Period 1 order (48 units) is likely lost (arrived=0 after 5 periods); Period 3 order (66 units) is overdue (3 periods passed); Period 4 order (21 units) is missing after 2 periods. Oddly, the Period 5 order arrived in only 1 period. Total units in-transit (186) include these potentially lost/delayed shipments. I will set L to 1 to account for the most recent observed arrival speed from P5, but I must explicitly set mu_hat high to ensure the OR engine targets a larger stock buffer to compensate for the inventory 'sink' created by missing units which may never arrive. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*60 to reflect recent demand intensity (avg of last 3 periods \u2248 58).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: Period 1 (48 units), Period 3 (66 units), and Period 4 (21 units) orders are likely lost or severely delayed (In-transit bloat). Lead time is volatile (observed 2 periods for P2, 1 period for P5). Demand regime shifted upward starting Period 6 (73 units).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is experiencing a critical stockout despite high demand (98 units last period). Reviewing the history: the Period 1 (48), Period 3 (66), and Period 4 (21) orders are missing far beyond the promised lead time (L=2). This 'In-transit' bloat of 186 units is misleading the OR backend, as 135 of those units are almost certainly lost. Only the Period 6 (51) order is still within a plausible delivery window if L=2. Demand has surged since Period 6 (73 units followed by 98 units), likely due to the category (trainer socks) being seasonally popular as spring begins in late March/April. To force the OR backend to place a new order despite the 'In-transit' ledger, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~85 units/period (avg of last 2). With L=2, the required coverage is (1+L) * 85 = 255. Even if the Period 6 order (51) arrives, we need much more to cover current stockout and future demand. Setting mu_hat to 255 and sigma_hat higher to 40 to handle the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand surge confirmed for trainer socks: Period 6-7 average (85.5) is ~100% higher than early period average (~43).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand seasonal regime for trainer socks (Apr 8th start), with Period 6-8 demand averaging 81 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~40. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent arrivals (P2 arrived P4, P5 arrived P6, P6 arrived P8) show a realized lead time of 1.67, broadly supporting the promised L=2. However, several earlier orders (P1, P3, P4) remain 'In-transit' far beyond their window, totaling 135 missing units. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (total In-transit) to calculate orders, these 'ghost' units are preventing new orders from being placed, leading to stockouts. To bypass this, I am setting an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat that effectively ignores the lost inventory. I forecast demand at ~85 units/week. For (L+1)=3 periods, mu_hat = 255. Given the stockout risk and pipeline bloat, I will use an explicit lead time of 2 and mu_hat of 450 to force the backend to place an order despite the 258 units already in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory: Orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), and P4 (21) are 4+ periods overdue and likely lost, causing systemic under-ordering due to pipeline bloat.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), we are facing a critical inventory shortage. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'trainer socks' has surged significantly as the season warms up, averaging 78 units over the last 4 periods (P6-P9), compared to ~45 units previously. More importantly, we have a massive pipeline bloat of 433 units, much of which consists of 'ghost inventory' from lost or severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P4 totaling 135 units). Because the OR backend subtracts this pipeline from the target base stock, it will under-order unless we set \u03bc\u0302 high enough to overcome this offset. I am using the 'explicit' method for \u03bc\u0302 to force a target that accounts for both the seasonal demand increase and the 135 units of likely lost stock. For \u03bc\u0302, target demand is (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 78 = 234. Adding back the 135 lost units to offset the pipeline deduction, I set \u03bc\u0302 to 369. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (actual lead times have been 1 and 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: In-transit 'ghost' inventory from P1, P3, P4 (135 units) is confirmed lost; mu_hat must be boosted to offset these phantom units in the OR pipeline calculation until they are cleared or accounted for.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current date (April 22) aligns with the seasonal transition toward warmer weather in many regions, supporting the sustained demand for 'trainer socks' observed since Period 6. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P6-P10) is 78 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline (~43). Lead times have stabilized around 1-2 periods for recent arrivals (P8, P9), although total in-transit stock still includes 135 units of 'ghost' inventory from P1, P3, and P4. These lost units artificially inflate the pipeline, causing the OR engine to under-order. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value (312) that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1 + 1 extra safety period) at the current regime (78 * 4). This ensures the base stock calculated (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) is high enough to trigger new orders despite the 135-unit pipeline bloat. As on-hand inventory is healthy (220), this approach bridges the service level risk while the backend works through the pipeline distortion.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P12 (2019/04/29). Historical demand analysis confirms a seasonal surge for trainer socks starting in Period 6 (March), likely tied to warmer spring weather. Recent demand (P11) saw a peak of 116 units. The average demand across the last 6 periods (P6-P11) is 84.3 units per period. The pipeline currently shows 135 units in-transit, but these are 'ghost' units from P1, P3, and P4 that are now 8+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the target base stock, it will under-order by 135 units unless I artificially inflate mu_hat. Promised L=2, so base stock target covers (1+L)=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~255 units (85 * 3). To neutralize the 135 lost units being subtracted by the backend, I set mu_hat (explicitly) to 255 + 135 = 390. This ensures the backend orders enough to maintain stock despite the pipeline distortion. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period actual arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Systemic under-ordering risk: OR backend subtracts 135 confirmed lost units (P1, P3, P4) from pipeline inventory; mu_hat must be adjusted upward by +135 until these units are cleared to maintain actual service levels.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. We are in a high-demand regime for 'Fine-knit trainer socks' as we move into the warmer spring/summer period. The last three periods (P10-P12) show mean demand of 98.7, which is a significant step up from the ~70-80 range seen in early April. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units). The pipeline contains 296 units, but 135 of these (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (296) from the calculated base stock, it will under-order unless we artificially inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat at 435: this represents 3 periods of expected demand (approx. 100 units/period * 3 = 300) plus a 135-unit offset to neutralize the ghost inventory. This ensures the engine places an order to cover upcoming demand despite the bloated pipeline. I will set sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~100 units/week (Periods 10-12 average: 98.7). Seasonal peak for trainer socks aligns with late spring/early summer.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the product 'Fine-knit trainer socks' is in peak seasonal demand. Recent demand (last 4 periods average: 89.25) remains high compared to Q1. The primary challenge is the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline: 135 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but are still subtracted from orders by the OR backend. I must inflate mu_hat to compensate for this phantom 135-unit pipeline. Current On-hand is 0. Demand for P13 was lower (61) but likely due to stockout constraints or holiday variation; I will rely on recent_N=6 to capture the spring regime. Lead time is volatile (1-2 periods), so I use 'calculate' to reflect the average. To counteract the 135 lost units being subtracted from the order quantity, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target mu_hat calculation: ((1+L) * Forecasted_Mean) + Lost_Units. With L=2 (approx), and mean demand ~100, (3 * 100) + 135 = 435.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/20. We are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which are hitting peak seasonality as we approach summer. The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level (average around 85-90 units). We have systemic inventory issues: 135 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (335 units = 135 lost + 181 from P13 + 19 from P14). The OR backend policy subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock', so these 135 'ghost' units cause systematic under-ordering. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by 135 units. For the baseline demand, I am using the mean of the last 6 periods (avg: 82), as demand is slightly lower than the P10-P12 peak but remains elevated compared to Q1. Therefore, mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Lost_Units = (1 + 2) * 82 + 135 = 246 + 135 = 381. sigma_hat is set to reflect the recent high volatility (std of last 6 periods is ~22, so sqrt(3)*22 \u2248 38).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 27, 2019. The product (trainer socks) is in a high-demand seasonal window (late spring). Historical demand from Period 10-15 has averaged 84.5 units, though there is volatility (range 61-116). Lead times have stabilized at approximately 2 periods (P12 arrived P14). A critical issue remains: 135 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but stay in the 'In-transit' count (357 units total). The OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline_inventory' from the base_stock calculation. To prevent stockouts caused by these 'ghost' units, I must inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods at 85 units/period = 255. Adding the 135 lost units to offset the pipeline deduction results in a target mu_hat of 390. I will use explicit mu_hat to ensure this offset is exact and explicit sigma_hat to account for the high seasonal variance (std dev ~20 -> sqrt(3)*20 approx 35).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/03. The product is trainer socks, which are in peak seasonal demand during the transition to summer. Recent demand remains strong, with Period 16 showing 102 units despite stockouts. The average demand over the last 7 weeks (P10-P16) is approximately 87 units/period, but actual potential demand is higher due to stockouts in P13 and P16. A significant issue persists: 135 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/overdue but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 437. The OR backend subtracts this 'ghost' inventory from the target base stock, leading to chronic under-ordering. To compensate, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Base mu_hat forecast = (1+L) * 95 = 3 * 95 = 285. Adjusted mu_hat = 285 + 135 (lost units) = 420. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for the fact that 135 units in its pipeline calculation will never arrive. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture high recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 (June 10). The product is trainer socks, which are in peak seasonal demand (late spring/early summer). Recent demand (Periods 11-17) has averaged 86.7 units/week, with peaks over 100. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory of 135 units (Orders from P1, P3, P4) that are visible in the in-transit pipeline (375 total) but are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit units (including the 135 ghost units) from the target base stock, it will consistently under-order by 135 units. To counteract this, I must explicitly increase mu_hat by +135. In Period 17, the order from P13 (181 units) was expected (L=2) but did not arrive, though P15 and P16 arrived. This suggests P13 might also be lost or delayed. However, for now, I will treat only the original 135 as lost to avoid over-ordering. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as: [Forecasted Demand for (L+1) periods] + [Ghost Inventory Offset]. Forecast = 95 units/week. L=2 (L+1=3). Base mu_hat = 3 * 95 = 285. Adjusted mu_hat = 285 + 135 = 420. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (approx 15% of demand) to ensure high service level during peak season.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Potential additional shipment loss: Period 13 order (181 units) is now 3 periods overdue (L=2 promised) while subsequent orders have arrived. Pipeline remains heavily inflated by non-delivered units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', currently in its seasonal peak (June). Historical demand from Period 6 onwards oscillates between 61 and 116 units, averaging approximately 81 units per week. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline (469 units) is significantly inflated by 'ghost' inventory: P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), and now P13 (181) are all severely overdue and likely lost, totaling 316 lost units. The OR backend subtracts the full 469 in-transit units from its target inventory, causing severe under-ordering. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: target = (1+L)*demand + lost_inventory. With L=2, (1+2)*81 = 243. Adding the 316 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 559. This ensures the OR logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) triggers an order despite the 316 phantom units in the pipeline. I will use 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for high demand volatility observed during this seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 13 order (181 units) is lost, joining P1, P3, and P4. Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is now 316 units. Seasonality for trainer socks remains high through June.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24. This SKU (Fine-knit trainer socks) is in its peak seasonal window. Demand from Period 10-19 averages 90.3 units/period, showing a sustained high-demand regime. Supply chain issues continue to plague the pipeline: we have confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 (48), 3 (66), 4 (21), and now definitively Period 13 (181), totaling 316 'ghost' units. These units appear in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count (540 units) but will never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must offset this 316-unit pipeline inflation. Using the OR logic (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat), I will explicitly set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the 316 lost units. L is set to calculated (approx 2). Current demand mean (recent_10) is ~90. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+2)*90 + 316 = 586. sigma_hat is set to recent_10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are managing 'Fine-knit trainer socks', a highly seasonal summer product. Current demand remains robust (Period 19-20 avg: 77.5). The primary challenge is 'ghost' inventory: orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), and P13 (181) totaling 316 units are confirmed lost. These 316 units remain in the 'In-transit' count (629 total), causing the OR backend to under-order because it believes these units will arrive. To counteract this, mu_hat must be explicitly raised to cover (1+L) periods of actual demand PLUS the 316 'missing' units. Assuming L=2 (promised), mu_hat calculation: (1+2)*85 + 316 = 255 + 316 = 571. This forces the engine to place an order despite the bloated pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory is 316 units (P1, P3, P4, P13). All mu_hat values must include a +316 offset until these units are cleared to prevent stockouts.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand for 'trainer socks' remains in its peak seasonal regime, though showing signs of stabilization between 70-80 units. The most critical issue is the systemic under-ordering caused by 'ghost' inventory. There are a total of 316 confirmed lost units in the pipeline (Period 1: 48, Period 3: 66, Period 4: 21, and Period 13: 181). Because the OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' (currently 629) from its calculated base stock, these 316 lost units create a massive deficit in actual orders. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter. I calculate the base demand using the recent 10-period average (approx 80 units). With L+1 = 3, the standard mu_hat would be 240. I add the 316 lost units to this, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 556. This ensures the OR backend places an order despite the pipeline bloat. Sigma_hat is calculated manually for the recent regime (last 10 periods, std dev ~14.5 * sqrt(3) \u2248 25) to maintain the service level.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks', which typically sees peak demand during the warmer months (late spring/summer). Recent demand (Periods 19-22) has stabilized around an average of 78 units per week. However, the system faces a critical issue with 'ghost' inventory. There are 316 confirmed lost units in the pipeline (P1: 48, P3: 66, P4: 21, P13: 181). Because the OR backend subtracts the total In-transit (540 units) from the calculated base stock, these 316 lost units create a massive artificial deficit, leading the backend to order 0 units for the last two periods (P21, P22). To force the backend to place an order and maintain stock levels for a ~80 units/week demand regime, I must set 'mu_hat' to (1+L) * avg_demand + ghost_inventory. With Promised L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods), and avg_demand ~80, the required mu_hat is (3 * 80) + 316 = 556. This ensures the backend recognizes that the actual available pipeline is much lower than the reported value. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for 'trainer socks' has peaked and appears to be stabilizing at a lower regime than the June peaks; the average demand for the last 4 periods (P20-P23) is 74.5 units per week. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. We have confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 316 units from periods 1, 3, 4, and 13 which have never arrived. Additionally, the order from P19 (165 units) is now 4 periods old (L=2 promised) and likely lost as subsequent orders (P20) have already arrived. Total likely lost inventory (ghosts) in the pipeline is now 316 + 165 = 481 units. Current In-transit is 568, meaning 481/568 (85%) is likely non-existent. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this pipeline bloat (OR base_stock - pipeline), I must boost mu_hat by the lost units. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L)*74.5 + 481 = (3*74.5) + 481 = 704.5. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Confirmed Period 19 order (165 units) is lost. Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is now 481 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Demand is stabilizing at ~75 units/week post-peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Demand for trainer socks is stabilizing post-peak (May-June) at approximately 75 units per week (Avg P20-P24: 73.4). The pipeline inventory is severely inflated by 'ghost' shipments. Confirmed lost orders are: P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), and P19 (165), totaling 481 units. The OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from the base_stock, resulting in systemic under-ordering. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be boosted by the total lost units. Current calculation: 1+L = 3 periods of demand. Expected 3-period demand = 75 units/week * 3 = 225. Adding the 481 ghost-unit offset, mu_hat is set to 706. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current volatility of the stabilizing demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/5. The product is trainer socks, which saw a seasonal peak from April to June and is now stabilizing in a lower post-peak demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 70.2 units/week. Lead time remains erratic but generally averages 2 periods. The most critical issue is the massive pipeline bloat caused by confirmed 'ghost' inventory. Orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), and P19 (165) are severely overdue and almost certainly lost, totaling 481 units. The OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from its base stock calculation, leading to continuous stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Ghost Inventory. With L=2 (3 periods of coverage), Forecasted Demand=70, and Ghost Inventory=481, the calculation is (3 * 70) + 481 = 691. This ensures the backend places an order despite the 481-unit phantom pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (July-August) stabilized at ~70 units/week. Total confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory in pipeline increased to 481 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-peak demand phase (August), with demand stabilizing around 65-70 units per week. The critical issue remains significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline: orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), and P19 (165) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling 481 units. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' quantity (696) from the calculated base stock. To prevent systemic stockouts caused by these 481 phantom units, I must inflate 'mu_hat' to neutralize the offset. Using 'recent_N' for the base demand (N=4, mean ~64), the calculation is (1+L)*64 + 481. With L=2, this is 3*64 + 481 = 192 + 481 = 673. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this specific offset is applied. Sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Ghost inventory remains at 481 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Current demand regime (July-August) average is 68.3 units/period (last 6 periods).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/19, which is late summer. Demand for trainer socks has stabilized at a post-peak level of approximately 65-70 units per week (Period 22-27 mean: 66.3). On-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is significantly inflated (701 units) by 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), and P19 (165) are confirmed lost, totaling 481 units. The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be suppressed by this ghost inventory. To prevent persistent stockouts, I am applying an explicit mu_hat boost of +481 units. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the pipeline bloat. As the actual lead time has recently shown instability (P23 arrived in 3 periods), I will keep L at defaults to allow the system to use the promised L=2 for safety stock calculations while using the mu_hat offset to drive physical ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26), where trainer sock demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P23-P28), demand has averaged 62.2 units per week, significantly lower than the ~100 units/week seen in May/June. Lead times continue to show volatility, with P23 taking 3 periods to arrive. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' inventory: P1(48), P3(66), P4(21), P13(181), and P19(165) are all long-overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 481 units. Additionally, P24(155) and P26(1) are still within a reasonable window but haven't arrived. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 481 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I must offset mu_hat. Using recent_N (N=6) for demand gives a base of (1+2)*62.2 = 186.6. Adding the 481 offset results in 667.6. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 668. Standard deviation remains based on the recent regime to capture volatility without over-reacting to the lost shipment fluctuations.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for trainer socks remains in a stable post-peak regime, averaging 61.5 units over the last 6 periods (P24-P29). On-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline is heavily inflated by 806 units across all previous periods, but historical data confirms systemic shipment losses. Confirmed lost units: P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), and P19 (165), totaling 481 units. Additionally, the order from P24 (155 units) is now 6 periods old (well past L=2) and subsequent small orders from P26-P28 haven't arrived either, suggesting further supply chain disruption or that P24 is also lost. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to 'ghost' pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset for confirmed lost units in the pipeline (481). With L=2, demand forecast (1+L) * 62 = 186. Adding the 481 lost units gives a mu_hat of ~667. This forces the engine to order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory persists at 481 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19). Order from P24 (155 units) is now highly likely lost after 6 periods without arrival. Supply chain remains highly unreliable.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is in a post-peak demand regime for September, with recent demand averaging ~60 units/period (Periods 25-30 avg: 59.3). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with critical 'ghost' inventory issues. Specifically, orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), P19 (165), and P24 (155) are all significantly overdue and confirmed lost based on the arrival of subsequent orders (P27/P28 arrived in P30). This totals 636 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (In-transit), which the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the required base stock. To prevent stockouts caused by this systemic under-ordering, I must offset these 636 units. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+L) * demand + ghost_offset. Calculation: (3 * 60) + 636 = 816. I set sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility around this newer mean.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 24 order (155 units) is lost, joining P1, P3, P4, P13, and P19. Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is now 636 units. All mu_hat values must include a +636 offset to neutralize these phantom units until they are cleared.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in mid-September (2019-09-16). Demand for trainer socks has stabilized post-summer peak, averaging 60.8 units over the last 5 periods (P27-P31). The primary challenge continues to be systemic 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), P19 (165), and now P24 (155). This brings the total lost/phantom inventory to 636 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the 'In-transit' total (837) from the base stock to determine the order quantity, we must inflate the mu_hat parameter by +636 to prevent the system from essentially trying to 'wait' for these 636 units that will never arrive. Lead times remain unstable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), so I will use an explicit L=2 (promised) but base mu_hat on the recent post-peak demand regime (N=5) plus the 636 unit offset. Sigma_hat is calculated on the last 5 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is experiencing a post-summer demand stabilization. The current demand regime (last 7 periods) shows an average of 59.7 units/period, down from the spring/summer peak of ~100. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. We have confirmed losses from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, and 24, totaling 636 units (48+66+21+181+165+155). This ghost inventory artificially inflates the OR backend's pipeline count, causing it to under-order. To neutralize this, I must boost 'mu_hat' by +636. For the base forecast, I will use a recent_N of 7 to capture the current stable demand (approx 60 units/period). With L=2, the expected demand over (L+1) is ~180. Adding the 636 offset results in a target mu_hat of 816. Sigma will be calculated based on the recent stable period to reflect current volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (2019-09-30), the product (trainer socks) is transitioning from its peak summer season into early autumn. Recent demand (last 8 periods) has averaged 63.3 units/period, showing a steady decline from the spring/summer peak (~100 units). I will use recent_N=8 to capture this lower post-peak mean (approx 63 units) and lower volatility. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' inventory within the OR backend's pipeline calculation. The In-transit total is 748 units, but history confirms that orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), P19 (165), and P24 (155) have been lost (Total ghost = 636 units). Because the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock' to determine the order, it thinks we have 748 units coming when we actually only have 112 valid units (748 - 636) in the pipeline (the P33 order of 52 and the P34 pending order). Therefore, I must inflate mu_hat by +636 to neutralize these lost units and allow the OR engine to place sufficient orders to meet the actual demand forecast of ~63 units/period. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I will set L to 3 (explicit) to be conservative given recent stockouts and delivery variability.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is experiencing a period of high supply chain volatility and significant 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 931 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 19, and 24, totaling 636 units (48+66+21+181+165+155). The remaining 'legitimate' in-transit inventory is 295 units (Orders from P33 and P34). Demand has transitioned from the summer peak (~100/week) to an autumn regime; the last 4 periods average 68.5 units/week. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 636-unit pipeline bloat, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inject a +636 offset. Calculation: Base Demand Forecast (3 periods @ 70/unit) = 210. Offset needed = 636. Total mu_hat = 846. Lead time L is set to explicit 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P31) show logic still centers around 1-2 periods despite delays. Sigma_hat is set to explicit 35 to account for the current high variance and stockout risk.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is currently in a stable post-peak demand regime, averaging ~63 units per week over the last 10 periods (P26-P35). However, a severe systemic issue persists with 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), P19 (165), and P24 (155) have failed to arrive for many periods beyond their promised lead time (L=2) and are confirmed lost. This 'ghost' inventory totals 636 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (currently 931 units) from the target base stock, it believes we are over-stocked when we are actually at 0 on-hand inventory. To counteract this 'pipeline bloat' and force the OR engine to place necessary orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value is calculated as: Forecasted Demand x (L+1) + Total Ghost Inventory. With a forecast of 65 and L=2, mu_hat = (65 * 3) + 636 = 831. This ensures the backend covers real demand despite the phantom 636 units in the pipeline. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile 1-3 period actual arrivals observed recently.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The product is 'Fine-knit trainer socks'. Demand has entered a post-summer regime. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), mean demand is 63.2 units/period, down from the summer peak (~75-100 units). The lead time remains unstable, with recent arrivals showing 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). The most critical issue is the 'Ghost Inventory' in the pipeline. Total confirmed lost units are P1(48), P3(66), P4(21), P13(181), P19(165), and P24(155), totaling 636 units. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target stock; since 636 of the 879 'In-transit' units will never arrive, I must inflate mu_hat by +636 to neutralize them. Otherwise, the backend will stop ordering, leading to stockouts. I will use a 6-period window (N=6) to capture the current demand level (~63 units/period), resulting in a base mu_hat of (1+2)*63 = 189, and then add the 636 unit offset for a final mu_hat of 825. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same 6-period regime.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (Sep-Oct) confirmed at ~63 units/period average. No change to 'ghost' inventory total (636 units).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. The product is trainer socks, which saw a significant demand peak during late spring/summer (averaging ~100 units/period) and has now settled into a post-peak regime (Sep-Oct) averaging approx 63 units/period. The primary challenge remains 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Based on carry-over insights and checking history, orders from P1 (48), P3 (66), P4 (21), P13 (181), P19 (165), and P24 (155) have never arrived and are significantly past the promised lead time of 2. This totals 636 units of lost 'ghost' inventory. Additionally, recent orders from P34 (183 units) have not yet arrived (it has been 4 periods, which is beyond the L=2 promise but common for this unstable supply chain). The OR backend's base-stock calculation subtracts the 'In-transit' figure from the target. To ensure we actually order enough to meet demand despite the 636-unit pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat to (1+L) * 63 + 636. Using L=2 (promised), this works out to 3 * 63 + 636 = 189 + 636 = 825. This offset forces the OR engine to place an order that ignores the units it believes are coming but are actually lost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for trainer socks (372860024) has stabilized in a post-summer/autumn regime, averaging 55.4 units over the last 5 periods (P34-P38). The supply chain remains highly problematic. The OR backend currently sees an In-transit pipeline of 879 units. Based on historical data, this pipeline is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments). Known lost orders: P1(48), P3(66), P4(21), P13(181), P19(165), and P24(155), totaling 636 units. Additionally, the order from P34 (183 units) is now 4 periods overdue (promised L=2) and has likely joined the pool of lost shipments, bringing the total estimated ghost inventory to 819 units (636 + 183). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, mu_hat is set using an 'explicit' value calculated as: (1 + L) * Forecast_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. With L=2 and Forecast=55, mu_hat = (1 + 2) * 55 + 819 = 165 + 819 = 984. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the high reported in-transit numbers. Sigma_hat is set using the standard 5-period window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Confirmed Period 34 order (183 units) is lost, joining previous ghost inventory. Total confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is now 819 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P34). Demand has stabilized at ~55 units/period for the late autumn regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for trainer socks has declined from the summer peak (~100 units) to a late autumn regime averaging approximately 55 units over the last 10 periods. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with significant 'ghost' inventory. Period 39 reported a total confirmed lost inventory of 819 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P34). This 'ghost' inventory inflates the OR backend's 'pipeline' calculation, causing it to think there are 819 more units coming than actually exist, leading to zero-orders and stockouts. To neutralize this, I must add the total ghost units (819) to the mu_hat forecast. For Period 40, the base demand forecast is ~55 units per period. Over a (1+L) = 3 period window, this is 165 units. Adding the 819 unit offset results in a mu_hat of 984. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised), and sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (N=10) to handle the demand transition.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Period 34 order (183 units) is lost. Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is now 819 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P34). Current demand regime (Nov) is lower, averaging ~50-55 units.

The SKU '372860024' (fine-knit trainer socks) is currently in a low-demand late-autumn regime, with demand in the last two periods dropping to 22 and 23 units, significantly lower than the ~55 units observed in early autumn. The pipeline is severely distorted by 819 units of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P34). This 'ghost' inventory leads the OR backend to believe the supply is sufficient, causing it to stop ordering despite zero on-hand inventory. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to include a massive offset equal to the lost units plus the forecast for 3 periods (L+1). I forecast demand at ~25 units/period for the current regime. Total mu_hat = (3 * 25) + 819 = 894. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level to account for the reliability issues. Lead time is set to 2 (promised), as actual lead times remain volatile but generally cluster around 1-3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 39: demand dropped from ~55 to ~23 units/period (-58%). Ghost inventory remains constant at 819 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 39-41) has dropped significantly to an average of ~23.3 units/period, down from the previous regime of ~55-60. This reflects a shift into the late autumn/winter season for trainer socks. My goal is to maintain sufficient stock while accounting for the significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (819 units), which the OR backend incorrectly views as incoming stock. Period 39's order arrived on time (L=2), but the supply chain remains unreliable. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out orders due to the 819-unit pipeline inflation, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS an 819-unit offset. Given L=2, (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand is 3 * 23.3 \u2248 70. Adding the 819 offset, mu_hat becomes 889. Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 3 to reflect the current lower volatility of the new demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for fine-knit trainer socks has entered a late-autumn/winter low regime, significantly dropping from the summer peak (~100 units/period) and previous stabilization levels (~60 units/period). The last 4 periods average 28.75 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this shift. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable with 819 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, and P34). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (905 units) from the calculated base stock, and 819 of those units are confirmed lost, I must explicitly boost mu_hat by +819 units to neutralize these phantom units and ensure the physical on-hand inventory (currently 58) is replenished to meet anticipated demand. Without this offset, the system would stop ordering entirely, assuming thousands of units are arriving when they are not. Lead time L is set to calculate (backend average) as observed arrivals (P39 at L=2) suggest the promised lead time of 2 is the most frequent occurrence despite the high loss rate.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 9, 2019. Demand for fine-knit trainer socks has entered a late-autumn/winter low regime, averaging 30.25 units over the last 4 periods (P40-P43: 23, 25, 45, 28) following a sharp drop from the ~55-63 range. The inventory situation is critical due to 819 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P34). The OR backend sees the total 'In-transit' of 879 units (819 ghosts + recent orders) and subtracts them from the base stock. Given that actual demand is low (~30 units/week), and on-hand inventory is 56, we are covered for nearly 2 weeks. To prevent the OR backend from zeroing out all future orders due to the 819-unit pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to 'explicit' with a value of 910. This value is derived from the expected demand for the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods) which is ~90 units, plus the 819 'ghost' units, and a small buffer. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the phantom units and maintain a realistic service level. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility of the winter regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Winter demand regime confirmed at ~30 units/period (Periods 40-43 average: 30.25). Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 819 units, requiring a constant mu_hat offset of +819 to ensure ordering continuity.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is December 16, 2019. We are in the winter demand regime for trainer socks, which has stabilized at approximately 30 units per period (average of the last five periods is 28.6). The ghost inventory (confirmed lost shipments) remains at a total of 819 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P34). Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (881) from the base stock to determine the order size, and 819 of those units will never arrive, we must inflate the mu_hat parameter by +819 units to neutralize this 'phantom' pipeline. Without this offset, the backend would believe we are over-stocked and stop ordering. Lead time remains volatile, between 1 to 3 periods, so the 'calculate' method is used to reflect the historical average of 2.1 periods. Sigma_hat is set using the last 6 periods to capture the lower volatility of the current winter regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 372860024 (trainer socks) is in a winter demand regime. Period 45 showed a spike in demand (81 units), which is likely related to pre-Christmas shopping (Dec 16-22). However, historical data for November/December suggests a baseline mean of ~30-35 units excluding such peaks. On-hand inventory is 0. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory': out of 911 units in-transit, 819 units are confirmed lost (P1, 3, 4, 13, 19, 24, 34). These lost units inflate the pipeline inventory, causing the OR backend to under-order. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be set to the forecasted demand for (1+L) periods PLUS 819. Predicted demand for L=2 is ~35 per period. (1+2)*35 = 105. Adding the 819 unit offset gives an explicit mu_hat of 924. This ensures the backend places an order to satisfy actual demand by ignoring the phantom pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to account for recent lead-time volatility (range of 1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for the recent demand spike variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed Christmas spike (81 units) in Period 45. Ghost inventory remains constant at 819 units, requiring a sustained mu_hat offset. Systemic lead time variability persists (1-3 periods).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47 (Dec 30), we are exiting the Christmas/New Year peak. Demand in Period 46 was 67, following a peak of 81. The average demand for the last 3 periods (including the spike) is 60.3 units. However, we are moving into January, a typically lower demand period for trainer socks compared to the December gift-giving season. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: 'ghost' inventory (confirmed lost shipments) totals 819 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P19, P24, P34). The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1056 units) from the base stock. Since 819 of these units will never arrive, the 'mu_hat' must be explicitly adjusted upward by 819 to neutralize this math and trigger actual orders. I will set the base 'mu_hat' for the next 3 periods (L+1) at 50 units/period (reflecting a post-holiday cool-down) plus the 819 offset, totaling 969. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen during the December swings.
