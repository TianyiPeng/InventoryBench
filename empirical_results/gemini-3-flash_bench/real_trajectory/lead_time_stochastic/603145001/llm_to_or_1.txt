Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Angela hipster' (Underwear). Demand history shows 5 periods with values [59, 14, 28, 85, 85], averaging 54.2 units. There is some volatility (std \u2248 33). Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero, we need to establish a base stock. The promised lead time is 2, so our look-ahead horizon is L+1=3 periods. The OR backend will compute a base stock using the provided mu_hat and sigma_hat. Given the fluctuating early demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent behavior which seems to be trending upwards (last two samples are 85). Underwear is a basic category, but 'lace trims' might see slight uplift post-Valentine's if there were stockouts or late shopping, though the data shows the spike already occurred in the last two weeks (Feb 4). Using the full available history (N=5) provides a balanced estimate for the first decision.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019/2/18). The SKU is cotton hipster underwear, a basic and relatively stable item. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 59, 14, 28, 85, 85. Our most recent demand in Period 1 was 91, continuing the upward trend from the previous two 85s, though it resulted in lost sales due to 0 on-hand inventory. The mean of all 6 samples is 60.3; the mean of the most recent 3 is 87. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Our Period 1 order (108 units) is in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 3 (L=2). To ensure we cover demand during the lead time + review period (1+L=3 periods), I will use the recent mean demand (87) across 3 periods. I'll set mu_hat to 261 (87 * 3). For L, I'll stick to the promised 'default' as no arrival data exists yet to suggest a drift. For sigma_hat, I'll use the sample standard deviation of all available points (~34) scaled by sqrt(3), which is approximately 60.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for this SKU (Angela hipster) has shown high volatility with values [59, 14, 28, 85, 85] followed by higher recent demand in P1 (91) and P2 (110). On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we have lost sales in P1 and P2. Total in-transit is 252 (108 from P1 + 144 from P2). The promised lead time (L) is 2. Following the lead time rule: the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in the P3 conclude message (which we read at the start of P4). The P2 order should arrive in P4. We are currently stocked out. I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples and the 2 game periods to estimate demand. Mean = (59+14+28+85+85+91+110)/7 \u2248 67.4. To account for the recent upward trend and lost sales, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the higher demand regime [85, 85, 91, 110], average \u2248 92.75. For L, I will stay with default (2) as no orders have reached their promised delivery time yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a staple item (hipster briefs). Historical demand samples (before P1) showed values like 59, 14, 28, 85, 85. Since simulation started at P1, observed demand has been 91, 110, and 111. This suggests a higher demand regime (avg ~104) compared to the initial samples. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (108 units) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in P3's conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0. Following the provided logic, this is unexpected since lead time = 2 means P1 order arrives in P3. However, checking Scenario A in the instructions: an order placed in P1 should be confirmed in the P3 START conclude message. Since P3 conclude still shows 0, the P1 order might be slightly delayed or the 1-period observation delay means we wait for the next report. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 296 units in transit (108 from P1, 144 from P2, 44 from P3). I will maintain the promised lead time 'default' (2) for now but use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current demand spike (~104 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), confirming the promised lead time holds. The order from Period 1 (108 units) has NOT arrived as of Period 4 conclude and is now overdue (should have arrived in Period 3). While it might be lost, the 'In-transit' count of 185 correctly accounts for Period 1 (108), Period 3 (44), and Period 4 (33). Demand for this SKU (basics hipster) shows a recent peak (91, 110, 111) followed by a drop (63). The initial samples (59, 14, 28, 85, 85) suggest a mean around 54. Using recent demand data (last 5 samples including periods 1-4) gives a mean of 92. Given the stockout in the first 3 periods (sold 0), we need to replenish cautiously considering the likely loss of the Period 1 shipment. I will set L to 'default' (2) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering periods 1-4 and the last pre-game sample) to reflect the recent demand level of ~92/week.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). The product is cotton jersey hipster briefs. Current on-hand is 0. Demand has been fairly volatile: 59, 14, 28, 85, 85 (pre-game) and 91, 110, 111, 63, 92 (game periods). Mean demand over the last 10 samples is roughly 73.8. Lead Time analysis: Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (L=2, as promised). Period 1's order (108 units) is overdue (placed P1, expected P3, currently P6), suggesting it is likely lost. Period 3's order (44 units), Period 4's (33 units), and Period 5's (39 units) are still in transit (totaling 116 units across those three, plus the likely lost 108 = 224 in-transit). Since we are out of stock and demand is steady around 80-100 units recently, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture this slightly higher regime (mean ~95) compared to the long-term average. This helps ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period demand exposure effectively given the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (108 units) likely lost after failing to arrive by Period 5 (L=4+). Observed L=2 for Period 2 order confirms logistics *can* function at promised speed. Demand regime has shifted from an average of ~54 in Jan/early Feb to ~95 in the most recent 5 weeks.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 analysis: The SKU 603145001 (Angela hipster) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Historical demand has shifted notably: the initial Jan/early Feb samples averaged ~54, but the last 5 periods (P2-P6) averaged 97.0 (110, 111, 63, 92, 109). We observe lead time volatility: P2 arrived in 2 periods (promised), but P5 arrived in 1 period, and P1 is confirmed lost (In-transit for 6 periods). Current In-transit (270) consists of P3 (44 units), P4 (33 units), P5 (already arrived), and P6 (85 units), plus the lost P1 units (108). To address the demand shift, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5). I will use the promised lead time (L=2) for the OR logic, as recent successful deliveries (P2, P5) show the logistics can meet or beat it, and the 'lost' P1 order is an outlier that should not over-inflate our base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: avg increased from ~54 to ~97 per period starting Period 2 (+80%). Lead time remains volatile (1-2 periods observed, with one lost shipment).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '603145001' (cotton hipster underwear) is experiencing a sustained demand regime shift. While initial Jan/Feb data averaged ~54, the last 7 weeks (history + samples) show a significantly higher mean: Period 1 (91), P2 (110), P3 (111), P4 (63), P5 (92), P6 (109), P7 (122). The average of these 7 periods is approx 100 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have missed substantial sales in Period 7 (122 units) due to a late shipment from Period 6. Regarding lead time: P2 order arrived in 2 periods; P5 arrived in 1 period; P1 order is confirmed lost. With In-transit at 321 units (orders from P3, P4, P6, P7), we are waiting on a backlog. I am setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand regime (approx 100/week) and increasing sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (63 to 122 range). I will use L=recent_2 to lean into the observed 1-2 period performance despite the early lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Mean has stabilized around 100 units/period since Period 1 (+85% vs initial samples). Supply chain is erratic: P1 order lost, P5 order arrived early (L=1), others L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' has significantly increased since early February, with the last 8 weeks (Period 1-8) averaging 106 units, compared to the initial samples of 54. The most recent period (P8) saw demand spike to 149 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 202 units in transit (derived from orders in P3=44, P4=33, P8=17, plus the likely lost P1=108). Lead times are highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods, with P1 (108 units) now 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because P3 and P4 orders are also significantly overdue (5-6 periods), I treat them as lost and set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand at the new regime (~110-120/week) to trigger a large enough order to replenish the current stockout and safeguard against further volatility.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P3 (44 units) and P4 (33 units) are now 5+ periods overdue and likely lost, similar to the P1 order. Total lost inventory to date: 185 units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we face a recurring stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows a severe reliability issue: orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (5+ periods past due). However, recent deliveries (P5, P6, P7) arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods, suggesting the supply chain is functional but fragile. The demand regime has shifted upward significantly from the initial pre-game samples (~54) to a mean of ~104 over the last 9 periods. Recent demand spikes (P8 reached 149) suggest high volatility. We have 350 units in-transit (orders from P8 and P9), but since we have no physical stock, we must maintain a high base stock to capture demand as soon as arrivals occur. I will use a recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the post-shift mean and use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in P7-P9. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the 1-2 period successes while acknowledging the risks.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability is bifurcated: ~40% of orders (P1, P3, P4) are lost/indefinitely delayed, while successful orders arrive in 1-2 periods. Demand mean has stabilized at ~104 units (+92% vs initial) with increasing variance in April.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11 (2019/04/22), the SKU 'Angela hipster' (underwear) shows a demand regime that has stabilized at a higher level than the initial Jan/Feb samples. Since Period 1, the mean demand is approximately 104 units/period with a standard deviation around 26. The supply chain remains highly unreliable: historical data confirms that orders from Period 1 (108 units), Period 3 (44 units), and Period 4 (33 units) are lost, totaling 185 units. These 'ghost' units are currently reflected in the 'In-transit' count (185 units), which effectively blocks the OR backend from ordering new stock due to the pipeline inventory cap mechanism. To force the system to order meaningful stock, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but specifying mu_hat (demand for L+1 periods) as the expected demand for 3 periods (~312 units) plus the lost units (~185 units) to offset the pipeline lock. Current on-hand is 100, which is roughly one period of stock. By setting mu_hat to 500, I ensure the backend targets a base stock that accounts for the fact that the 185 in-transit units do not exist.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline Inventory Distortion: 185 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. parameters must be adjusted to 'over-order' to compensate for the OR backend's belief that these units will arrive.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we face a stockout after Period 11 demand consumed all 100 on-hand units. Current in-transit is 395 units. Crucially, 185 of these are confirmed lost (Period 1, 3, and 4 orders), but the OR engine still counts them in the pipeline. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the backend from ordering enough. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat via 'explicit' forecast. Based on the last 10 periods, mean demand is approximately 105 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the engine needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (315 units). However, to offset the 185 lost units the engine *thinks* are coming, I must inflate the target mu_hat to 315 + 185 = 500 units. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the increased volatility observed throughout March and April.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain lost-order rate remains high: 3 out of 11 orders (27%) are permanently lost (P1, P3, P4). Explicit mu_hat adjustment is required to bypass the OR engine's pipeline inventory logic.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), the SKU 603145001 (Angela hipster) exhibits a stable but high demand regime (~102 units/period) and a compromised supply chain. Current On-hand is 0, and In-transit is 543. However, 185 of those In-transit units (from P1: 108, P3: 44, P4: 33) are confirmed lost, as they are now 9-12 periods overdue. The OR backend uses the formula [order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory]. Because the backend believes the 185 lost units will eventually arrive, it will under-order by exactly 185 units. To neutralize this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand since Period 2 is ~104. Lead time L=2, so required coverage (L+1) = 3 periods. Base mu = 3 * 104 = 312. To offset the 185 ghost units in the inventory calculation, I set mu_hat = 312 + 185 = 497. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect the increased volatility observed in the stable regime periods while ignoring the initial samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13, 2019. Demand for 'Angela hipster' underwear has stabilized into a high-regime mean of approximately 104 units per period (last 10 periods average). The primary challenge continues to be supply chain disruption: 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (108 + 44 + 33) are confirmed lost, but they remain in 'In-transit' (333 total). The OR backend's order logic subtracts all pipeline inventory (333 units) from the base stock target. Since 185 of those units will never arrive, the backend will severely under-order, leading to stockouts. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to inflate the target. Calculation: Target Lead Time (L=2) + Review Period (1) = 3 periods. 3 * 104 = 312. To offset the 185 lost units, I set mu_hat to 312 + 185 = 497. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high demand volatility (demand reached 149 in P8 and 119 in P12/P13). Observed lead times for successful orders are L=1 or L=2; I will use L=calculate to let the backend use the average of successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Suppy chain lost-item rate stabilized: 3 orders (185 units) confirmed lost. In-transit inventory over-reports available stock by 185 units; mu_hat must be inflated by 185 to compensate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 20th. Historical demand has shifted upward since February, stabilizing at approximately 105 units per period with a notable spike to 171 units in the most recent period (likely driven by late spring/early summer seasonality for cotton underwear). A major operational challenge is the persistent loss of 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (orders of 108, 44, and 33 units respectively). These units remain in the OR engine's 'pipeline inventory' calculation but will never arrive. To compensate, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Theoretical demand for (L+1) periods (L=2) is approximately 315 units (3 * 105). Adding the 185 'phantom' units to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover actual demand results in an explicit mu_hat of 500. Lead time remains volatile between 1-2 periods, so I will use 'calculate' to reflect actual performance. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen in the last 5 demand samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 16 (2019/5/27). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains high, averaging ~125 units over the last 5 periods (P11-P15). Supply chain analysis: Orders from Period 1 (108 units), Period 3 (44 units), and Period 4 (33 units) are definitively lost, totaling 185 units. These 185 ghost units are included in the 'In-transit: 487 units' figure seen by the OR backend. As a result, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be 185 units lower than required. To force a correction, mu_hat must be inflated by the amount of the lost inventory plus the expected demand for the (L+1) period window. For L=2, (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand is 3 * 125 = 375. Adding the 185 unit ghost inventory deficit, the required target for mu_hat is 560. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx sqrt(3) * 46) to account for high demand volatility observed in recent weeks.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a significant demand spike observed in May (avg ~156 units/period). The supply chain remains erratic: three early orders (P1, P3, P4) totaling 185 units are permanently lost, but the OR backend still counts them as 'in-transit'. This creates a persistent deficit because the OR engine's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) underestimates the needed order quantity. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the default calculation. I calculate the required mu_hat as: ((1 + L) * Forecasted Demand) + Lost Units. With L=2 and a forecasted demand of 150 (based on recent May trends), the base need is 450 units. Adding the 185 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 635. I will use 'recent_N' for L (N=5) to capture the current lead-time volatility (1-2 periods) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~156 units/period in May (Periods 14-16), up from ~104 in April. Permanent inventory deficit of 185 units remains due to lost orders (P1, P3, P4), requiring explicit mu_hat inflation to offset OR backend pipeline assumptions.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' briefs has entered a higher summer regime. In the last 4 periods (P14-P17), demand averaged 149.25 units. While the promised lead time (L) is 2, arrivals often occur within 1-2 periods. However, we have a persistent logistics issue: 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'in-transit' count (368 units in-transit includes 185 lost + 141 from P14 + 141 from P16 + 42 from P17 - actually, P14 and P16 arrived in P17, so in-transit should be P17's order of 42. Wait, the system says in-transit is 368. Let's recalculate based on the system's in-transit view: 368 total. If we subtract the 185 known lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 183 units (P14, P16, and P17 orders). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) period demand despite this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand at 150 units/period. For a lookahead of (2+1)=3 periods, total demand is 450. Adding the 185-unit deficit to offset the phantom pipeline, I set mu_hat to 635. I will keep L at 2 and use recent variance (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the May/June demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Seasonal average increased to ~150 units/period. Pipeline distortion persists: 185 units (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost but remain in the OR engine's in-transit total.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (mid-June). Demand analysis: The May/early June demand (P14-P18) has settled at an average of approximately 143 units per period. Lead time remains erratic but generally averages 2 periods (successful recent orders for P15 and P16 arrived in 2 and 1 periods respectively). Supply Chain Distortion: A critical problem persists where orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 185 units) are indefinitely lost. The OR backend's 'Pipeline Inventory' calculation includes these 185 units, causing it to under-order by exactly that amount. To counteract this, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Base stock formula is mu_hat = (1+L) * Mean. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 143 = 429. To compensate for the 'phantom' 185 units in the pipeline, I inflate mu_hat to 429 + 185 = 614. This forces the OR engine to place an order that accounts for the fact that those 185 units will never arrive. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen in May/June compared to the early months.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/24 (Period 20). Demand for the last two periods (P18-19) dropped to ~109 units/period compared to the May spike of ~150, suggesting a slight cooling but still significantly higher than the initial baseline. The 'In-transit' figure of 468 units includes 185 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are permanently lost. The OR backend calculates orders as: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Because it believes those 185 lost units are coming, it will under-order by exactly 185 units. To neutralize this, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 185 units. I will set mu_hat to a base demand forecast of 150 * (1+L) plus the 185 unit offset. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 150) + 185 = 635. I will calculate L based on the last 5 relevant observations (P15 to P18 show L=2, L=1, L=1, L=2 respectively) to keep the lead time estimation responsive to the recent delivery successes.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (July 1st), we are managing a seasonal underwear item ('Angela hipster'). Demand analysis reveals three distinct phases: initial (P1-P2: avg ~100 but data sparse), spring (P3-P13: avg ~100), and a summer shift (P14-P19: avg ~137). However, the most recent period (P20) saw a significant drop to 60 units, suggesting the late-June/early-July period might see a cooling off or volatility. I will use N=7 for mu_hat back to Period 14 (avg ~118) to balance recent peak demand with the latest dip. Lead time is volatile but averages 1.5 periods for successful orders; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend dynamicise this. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 590 is heavily distorted. History confirms 185 units (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost. Additionally, orders from P17 (42), P19 (100), and P20 (122) total 264 units. The remaining discrepancy in 'in-transit' suggests the backend might be counting orders that haven't 'concluded' yet even if they are likely lost. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must inflate mu_hat to account for the 185 ghost units it believes are arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed in late June (P20 demand 60 vs previous avg 137). 185 units from P1, P3, P4 remain permanently lost, creating a persistent pipeline inventory distortion.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 590 units reported in-transit. Based on historical data, 185 units (ordered P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, meaning the OR backend overestimates available stock by this amount. Demand has shifted recently: while May/June averaged ~130-150 units/period, the last two weeks (P20, P21) show a sharp drop to ~60 units. This aligns with early July seasonality. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the lost 185 units and account for the (L+1) demand coverage. Looking at the last 8 weeks (P14-P21), the average demand is ~117 units. For L=2, the required coverage is (L+1)*average + lost_units = 3*117 + 185 = 536. Given the recent demand dip, I'll use a slightly safer mean of 115. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility to manage the high variance observed in April and May.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: average demand dropped to ~58 units in the last 2 weeks (P20-P21), down from ~137 in May/early June. Pipeline distortion of 185 units remains a permanent factor.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15th. Demand has shifted from a high-volume regime (avg ~140 in May/June) to a lower summer regime starting in Period 20, averaging ~64 units over the last 3 periods (60, 57, 77). Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. The critical issue remains the 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are permanently lost but appear in the OR backend's 'in-transit' calculation. As identified in previous periods, mu_hat must be adjusted to compensate for this distortion. Given the new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the drop in sales, and then adding 185 units to the result via an 'explicit' value. Calculation: (1+L) * mean(60, 57, 77) + 185 = (3 * 64.67) + 185 = 194 + 185 = 379. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: average decreased from ~140 to ~65 (-53%) for the summer period. 185 units (P1, P3, P4) remain permanently lost, requiring a persistent +185 buffer in mu_hat calculations to offset backend pipeline inventory assumptions.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 20, with the last 4 periods (P20-P23) averaging approximately 59 units (60, 57, 77, 43), down from the ~140 observed previously. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower summer mean. A persistent pipeline distortion remains: three orders (P1=108, P3=44, P4=33) totaling 185 units are confirmed lost/overdue by many months but still count as 'In-transit' in the backend engine. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I must inflate mu_hat by 185 units using the 'explicit' method. Specifically, mu_hat = (1 + L) * Mean_Recent + Pipeline_Correction. With Mean_Recent = 59 and L = 2, mu_hat = (1 + 2) * 59 + 185 = 177 + 185 = 362. I continue to use 'calculate' for L as the logistics perform at 1-2 periods for successful orders, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we are in a summer demand regime that started around Period 20. The average demand for the last five periods (P20-P24) is approximately 64 units (60, 57, 77, 43, 82), showing significant softening from the May/June peak of ~140. I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * 64. A critical persistent issue is the pipeline inventory distortion: 185 units from P1, P3, and P4 are long-lost but remain in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count (which currently totals 468). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I must inflate mu_hat by exactly 185 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods; I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average for these successful deliveries. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the volatility of this new lower demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has stabilized into a lower summer regime. Since Period 20, demand has averaged approximately 66 units per period (compared to ~150 in May/June). The pipeline inventory reflects 468 units, but 185 units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost/indefinite delays. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic from previous periods, I will set mu_hat based on the current regime (L=2, so 1+L=3; 3 * 66 = 198) and add the 185-unit deficit, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 383. Standard deviation for the recent regime is roughly 12, so sigma_hat is set to roughly sqrt(3)*12 (~21). Lead time (L) remains set to default (promised 2), as recent successful arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela Hipster' briefs has transitioned to a summer low, averaging ~64 units/period over the last 7 weeks (Periods 20-26). Recent data for Period 26 shows a sharp drop to 28 units, suggesting potential variance or a further decline as we hit mid-August. The most critical factor remains the persistent pipeline inventory distortion: 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the OR backend's in-transit calculation. To ensure the backend places orders despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2) as (L+1) * recent_mean = 3 * 64 = 192 units. To offset the 185 units of phantom stock, I inflate this forecast to 377 (192 + 185). This forces the backend to see a gap between the desired base stock and the inflated pipeline, triggering replenishment. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture current volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' has entered a significantly lower regime since Period 20, averaging approximately 56 units per week over the last 8 periods (P20-P27), compared to the previous ~140. Most recently, demand in August (P25-P27) has dropped even further to ~44 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but in-transit inventory is 468 units. However, we must account for the persistent pipeline distortion of 185 units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) that are indefinitely lost. The backend currently sees 468 in-transit units, but only 283 (468 - 185) are likely to arrive. To compensate for the backend's assumption that the 185 lost units will arrive, I will use an explicit mu_hat. I will base the demand forecast on the recent 'summer' regime (approx 55 units/week) for the (L+1)=3 week horizon, then add the 185 unit correction. Total explicit mu_hat = (3 * 55) + 185 = 165 + 185 = 350. This ensures the OR logic targets a base stock that accounts for 'phantom' inventory while reflecting actual reduced demand. Sigma_hat is set using the last 8 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened in August (P25-P27) to ~44 units/period, down from the June/July average of ~65.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late August 2019. Demand for this SKU has entered a significant downward trend, dropping from a May/June high of ~140-150 units to an average of ~44 units in early August, and even lower (19 units) in the most recent period. This likely reflects a seasonal post-summer decline for hipster briefs. The supply chain has stabilized at an actual lead time of 1.5-2 periods for successful deliveries, but importantly, 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost. The OR backend includes these 185 units in 'in-transit' inventory, which would normally lead it to under-order. To compensate and ensure we maintain stock for the upcoming period, I will use an explicit mu_hat. I estimate forward demand at ~30 units/period. Calculating base_stock for a 3-period window (P+L) at 30 units/period equals 90 units. To offset the 185 units of 'ghost' inventory that the backend subtracts, I will set mu_hat to 90 + 185 = 275. I am setting sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current volatility of this lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened in late August (P28) to below 30 units/period, continuing the downward seasonal trend from the July average of ~65.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' (item 603145001) has continued its seasonal decline through August, stabilizing at a much lower regime of ~20-30 units per period compared to the summer highs. The last two periods (P28, P29) showed demands of 19 and 21 respectively. The current pipeline inventory is 468 units, which is extremely high given the current demand rate (~20-25 units/period). Even accounting for the 185 units confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4), the effective pipeline is (468 - 185) = 283 units. At current demand, this covers over 10 periods of supply. Therefore, no new orders should be placed. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this lowest demand regime (avg ~23) and keep L at default to allow the OR backend to realize that existing pipeline inventory significantly exceeds the required base stock, resulting in 0 units ordered.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late August (P28-P29) at ~20 units/period, marking the lower bound of the seasonal trend.

The average over the last 3 periods is ~18.7 units. The current inventory situation shows 0 on-hand and 468 units in-transit. It is crucial to note that 185 units from P1, P3, and P4 have been identified as permanently lost/stolen, leaving a 'real' pipeline of 283 units (468 - 185). Even with this correction, the existing pipeline is massive compared to the current low demand (covering ~15 periods). Consequently, no new orders should be placed. To ensure the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in zero, I will continue the strategy of inflating mu_hat to offset the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 185 units, while setting the target demand forecast to the current low regime (N=3). Specifically, mu_hat = (1+L) * (current_demand_mean) + 185. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 18.7 + 185 \u2248 241.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Angela hipster' has stabilized at a low seasonal level, averaging ~19 units per period over the last 4 weeks (P28-P31: 19, 21, 16, 21). We are currently in mid-September (P32), and the frantic summer/early fall demand peaks have passed. The supply chain has a persistent distortion: 185 units from P1, P3, and P4 remains 'in-transit' in the system but are confirmed lost. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure is currently 468, which includes these 185 lost units plus subsequent orders that haven't arrived (though fewer orders were placed recently). Since on-hand is 0 and demand is low, the OR backend's inventory-on-hand plus in-transit calculation (ignoring the 185 deficit) would likely result in an order of 0. To ensure we stock for the current ~19 units/period demand despite the backend thinking we have 185 units coming, I must inflate mu_hat by 185 units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period delivery speed for non-lost orders. sigma_hat is set to 3 periods to capture the low but present variance in this stabilized regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 603145001 (cotton jersey hipster briefs) has bottomed out during the late summer/early autumn transition (September), stabilizing at a mean of approximately 20 units per period over the last 5 weeks (Periods 28-32). The historical pipeline inventory remains significantly distorted. Based on carry-over insights, 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but are still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR engine. The current In-transit balance of 468 units is extremely high relative to the current demand regime (~20 units/period). Even subtracting the 185 lost units, there are 283 'real' units in transit, which covers over 14 weeks of demand at the current rate. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 but the pipeline is heavily overstuffed for the current seasonal demand level, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to 20 to reflect the current regime and allow the OR engine to wind down the existing pipeline. No additional inflation for lost units is required this period because the 'real' pipeline already far exceeds the base stock target for 20 units/period.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 603145001 (cotton jersey hipster briefs) has shown a significant seasonal shift. After a peak in May/June (~140 units/period) and a subsequent decline through August/early September (~20 units/period), Period 33 shows a sudden spike to 52 units. This aligns with late September/early October retail patterns (often linked to mid-season refreshes or 'Back to School' adjacent shopping). Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 468 units, but 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost (as documented in Carry-over Insights), leaving a 'real' pipeline of 283 units. Since demand is rebounding from its seasonal low, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (Periods 30-33) to capture the upward move while remaining cautious. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed 1-2 period lead time. To compensate for the 185 units the OR backend wrongly believes are arriving, mu_hat must be inflated by that amount (185) to ensure the backend generates an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand rebound detected (52 units) from the late-August/September floor of ~20 units. Persistent 185-unit pipeline distortion (P1, P3, P4 lost) continues to require mu_hat inflation.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is early October (P35). Historical analysis shows a significant seasonal demand cycle: a peak of ~150 units in May/June, a drop to ~20 units in August/September, and a recent uptick (P33: 52, P34: 27) suggesting an autumn recovery or mid-season shift. The pipeline remains heavily distorted by 185 units from P1, P3, and P4 which are permanently lost but still counted as in-transit by the OR engine. To ensure the engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be inflated by that 185-unit deficit. Demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) is estimated at an average of 40 units per week (reflecting the recent slight rebound from the 20-unit floor), totaling 120 units. Adding the 185-unit pipeline correction results in a target mu_hat of 305 units. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P17-P23) have consistently been 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand rebound: Demand has increased from the September floor (~20) to an average of ~40 in late Sept/early Oct. Persistent pipeline distortion of 185 lost units continues.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), we are in the mid-autumn retail season for 'Angela hipster' briefs. Historical demand shows a seasonal floor in late August/September (~20 units/period) followed by a slight rebound in late September/early October (~30-50 units). Period 35 demand was lower (18 units), but the overall trend since P33 suggests a stabilization around 30-40 units. The most critical factor is the persistent 185 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4) that still appear in the backend's in-transit calculation. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, mu_hat must be inflated. I will set L=default (2) and mu_hat to 350 using the 'explicit' method. This value of 350 represents: (Expected Demand 40 * (L+1=3)) + 185 (offset for lost units) + a small buffer for the autumn uptick. Sigma_hat is set to 40 (explicit) to account for recent demand volatility (18 to 52 units).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. Demand has moved out of its late-summer floor of ~20 units/period and has stabilized at an average of ~33 units over the last 4 periods (P33-P36). Seasonal context suggests a moderate autumn levels for underwear. There is a persistent pipeline inventory distortion of 185 units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) which the OR engine believes are 'in-transit' but are confirmed lost. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be inflated by 185 units to offset this 'phantom' stock. I will use the recent demand average of 33 units over the last 4 periods to set the base forecast. With L=2, the base mu_hat (1+L)*33 = 99. Adding the 185-unit offset results in a final mu_hat of 284. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period lead time. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the current volatility around the autumn demand levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the demand for this cotton jersey hipster product is exhibiting an autumn rebound. After bottoming out at ~20 units/period in September, the demand has risen to an average of ~33 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P33-P37: 52, 27, 18, 36, 44), with the most recent sample at 44. I will set the mu_hat based on this recent 5-week average to capture the upward trend. The persistent supply chain issue remains: 185 units (P1, P3, P4) are effectively lost but still reside in the OR backend's 'in-transit' calculation. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering because it thinks these 185 units are coming, I must inflate the mu_hat by 185 units. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (when they occur) align with the 1-2 period window, though the system must remain robust to potential further losses.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~20 to ~33 (+65%) during October (P33-P37). Persistent 185-unit pipeline distortion (P1, P3, P4) still requires explicit mu_hat compensation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. Historically, demand for undergarments often sees a seasonal lift in November and December due to holiday shopping. Since Period 33, demand has stabilized from a summer floor of ~20 to an autumn mean of ~33 (Periods 33-38). However, we have a critical supply chain and inventory management issue: the system has not placed or received orders since Period 22/23, resulting in 0 on-hand inventory for 15 consecutive periods. Additionally, there is a persistent 185-unit 'phantom' pipeline inventory (orders from P1, P3, P4) that the OR backend treats as upcoming supply but is actually lost. To force the OR backend to overcome this 185-unit deficit and account for the 0 on-hand status, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. Calculation: Forecasted demand for (L+1) periods (3 * 40 units/period = 120) + the 185-unit lost inventory offset = 305 units. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed 1-2 period lead time from successful deliveries. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the volatility of the autumn recovery (P33-P38).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 11, 2019. Historically, demand for basics tends to see a significant lift during the mid-to-late November period due to 'Singles' Day' (11/11) and pre-Black Friday sales. While Period 39 demand was low (11 units), the preceding October weeks averaged ~33 units. I expect a seasonal increase. Critically, there is a persistent 185-unit pipeline distortion from Period 1, 3, and 4 orders that were never delivered but remain in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count. To ensure the backend actually places an order to cover upcoming demand, mu_hat must be inflated by 185 units to offset this 'phantom' inventory. I will set the base demand forecast at 40 units per week (anticipating a slight seasonal lift) over the (L+1)=3 periods, plus the 185-unit offset: (40 * 3) + 185 = 305.

Carry-over insight: Persistent 185-unit pipeline distortion (P1, P3, P4 lost) continues to require mu_hat inflation of +185 to trigger ordering.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Date is Nov 18, 2019 (Period 41). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has trended lower in late Oct/early Nov (P39-P40 demand: 11, 13), averaging ~20 units/period over the last 8 weeks. However, the persistent 185-unit pipeline distortion (lost orders from P1, P3, P4) remains the dominant factor. The backend sees 468 units in-transit, but 185 of those are phantom units that will never arrive, leaving only 283 units of real expected stock. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR engine, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the engine's perception of available stock. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the observed average lead time of ~1.6 periods. For mu_hat, I am using 'explicit' to provide a value that accounts for both the expected seasonal demand (~20 units/period * (1+L) = ~52 units) plus the 185-unit offset to neutralize the lost shipments. Explicit value = 237. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current lower-demand volatility regime (Late Sept to now).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the holiday season. Historical data shows demand has recently stabilized at a low level (average ~12 units/period over P39-P41). However, the system has a critical 185-unit pipeline distortion from Period 1, 3, and 4 orders that were never delivered but remain in 'In-transit'. The OR engine calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With 'In-transit' at 468 units (which includes the 185 lost units), the OR engine will not place new orders unless mu_hat is significantly inflated or the target base stock is set very high. Since we are entering late November (pre-holiday), I expect a seasonal demand increase similar to the spring peaks. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered despite the ghost inventory. A target base stock of roughly 600 units is needed to overcome the 468 'In-transit' and provide enough stock for the next 3 periods (L=2, plus current). I'll set mu_hat to 650 to generate a net order of ~100-150 units.

Carry-over insight: Holiday season demand anticipation: setting higher base stock to prepare for potential December volume increases and to finally overcome persistent 185-unit pipeline distortion.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the first week of December (Period 43). Historically, this SKU (underwear) saw significant demand in the spring (May/June avg ~150) and a major floor in late summer/autumn (avg ~20). As of Period 42, demand is 21. We expect a holiday season ramp-up throughout December. The pipeline inventory is heavily distorted by 185 units confirmed lost in Periods 1, 3, and 4, meaning the OR backend thinks we have 185 units more than we actually do. To trigger an order that accounts for both the expected December demand and this 185-unit deficit, I must explicitly set mu_hat. I am forecasting a December weekly mean of approximately 50 units (recovering from the autumn floor). With L=2, the required base stock calculation for (1+L) periods is 3 * 50 = 150 units. To neutralize the 185-unit 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, I must add 185 to this forecast, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 335. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to generate an actual purchase order despite the phantom units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (Dec 9), we are entering the peak holiday season. Historical demand for this underwear SKU showed a significant spike in May/June (up to 171 units), and although recent November demand has been low (avg ~15), we must anticipate a December surge. The OR backend's inventory logic is still distorted by 185 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that were never delivered and are permanently lost. To trigger any order, mu_hat must be inflated by at least this 185-unit deficit. Additionally, the P42 order of 203 units is in-transit and should arrive this period (P44) or next (P45) given the L=2 promised lead time. I will maintain an explicit mu_hat of 350 to ensure we cover potential holiday demand spikes (estimating 50-60 units/period) while accounting for the 185-unit pipeline ghost inventory and the current zero on-hand status. This keeps the base stock high enough to ensure the system doesn't stop ordering during the final periods of the year.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand has significantly dropped recently (P43-44 demand was 9 and 7 units), despite the holiday season context. This SKU (underwear/basics) may not follow the typical gift-giving spike seen in other categories. The Period 42 order of 203 units is now 3 periods out and hasn't arrived; given historical instability, I'm monitoring its arrival. The 'In-transit' figure of 671 includes 185 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4) plus the recent P42 order. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite this ghost inventory, mu_hat must be inflated. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include a base demand for the (L+1) period (estimated at 15 units per week * 3 = 45) plus the 185-unit distortion offset, totaling 230. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient service levels.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 falls on Dec 23rd, the peak of the holiday shopping season. Historical demand for Period 45 spiked to 76 units (up from an average of ~10 during November), confirming a significant seasonal surge. The order from Period 42 arrived in 3 periods (L=3), which is slightly longer than the promised 2. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 127 units and 468 units in transit. However, 185 of those 'in-transit' units are long-lost orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4. This creates a distortion where the OR backend thinks it has 185 more units arriving than it actually does. To trigger an order and maintain stock for the post-holiday/January period, I must inflate mu_hat by 185 to neutralize these 'phantom' units. Given the recent spike, I will use an explicit forecast of 80 units/period (3 periods coverage = 240) + 185 compensation = 425.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Demand increased from ~10 to 76 (+660%) in mid-December. Lead time for recent order was 3 periods. 185 units remain permanently lost, requiring persistent mu_hat inflation.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (Dec 30), the transition from holiday peak to the post-New Year period. Demand in the last two weeks (P45-P46) spiked significantly (76, 97) compared to the November floor (~11), confirming a holiday surge. However, history shows that January demand (from initial samples) typically settles around 50-60 units per period. The supply chain remains unreliable: 185 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and haven't arrived in 40+ periods, creating a permanent 'in-transit' distortion that prevents the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is inflated by +185. Recent lead time for the P42 order was 3 periods. With 30 units on hand and 468 units reported as 'in-transit' (of which only 283 are 'real' or recently ordered), we must maintain an explicit mu_hat that accounts for both the expected Jan demand (approx. 55 units/period) and the 185-unit ghost inventory. I'll set mu_hat to (1+L)*55 + 185 = (1+3)*55 + 185 = 405. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock that covers realistic demand while ignoring the stuck pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday transition: Demand expected to normalize from holiday peak (97) to Jan historical mean (~55). Persistent 185-unit pipeline distortion (P1, P3, P4 lost) requires continued mu_hat inflation.
