Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 begins on 2019-02-11. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks shows a downward trend (752, 477, 500, 430, 384), likely stabilizing after an early January peak. The mean of the last 4 samples is 447.75, which is more representative of current demand than the full 5-week average including the 752 outlier. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the system must cover demand for the review period plus the lead time (1+L = 3 periods). I will set L to default (2), and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and lower volatility observed since mid-January.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The demand for 706016003 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) shows a significant downward trend over the last 6 weeks (from 752 down to 246). The most recent sample (Period 1) of 246 represents a 35% drop from the previous week's 384. This likely reflects a post-winter/holiday slowdown or a trend shift. I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this decelerating demand while still providing some buffer. The promised lead time is 2, so the Period 1 order (533 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. On-hand is currently 0 with 533 in transit. Setting parameters to 'recent_N' for demand ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock down to match the slowing sales velocity without overstocking unnecessarily high levels of inventory that would incur holding costs.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has shown a downward trend since early January (from 752 down to ~270 in February). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 and 2. There are 1,044 units in-transit (533 from P1 and 511 from P2). Given the promised lead time of 2, the P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, and the P2 order in Period 4. No evidence yet suggests actual lead time differs from promised. I will use N=4 for demand estimation to capture the recent regime (~339/period) while ignoring the January peak that likely represented a different seasonal state. The high profit margin (95% service level) warrants buffer stock, but the OR engine's cap and the existing pipeline of 1,044 units (covering ~3 periods of demand) will likely limit new ordering this period until the pipeline clears.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). We are managing 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a staple fashion item. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals have not yet started. Looking at the history: Period 1's order (ordered Feb 11) has not yet arrived by the end of Period 3 (conclude message from Feb 25). Given a promised lead time of 2, we expect P1's order to arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in Period 4's start. However, as of Period 3 conclude, arrived=0. This is consistent with L=2 because it should arrive during P3 resolution and show up in P4 resolve. We expect the first shipment of 533 units to be available for sale in Period 4. Demand history (pre-game): 752, 477, 500, 430, 384; Game history: 246, 296, 222. There is a clear downward trend in demand from the Jan peak towards a more stable level around 250-300. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this lower baseline while maintaining the promised lead time of 2 as there is no conclusive evidence yet that L > 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3729.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Reviewing the history: The order from Period 2 (511 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), as expected. However, the order from Period 1 (533 units) has not yet arrived or concluded. This suggests a potential lost shipment or significant delay, given the promised lead time is 2. The pipeline currently shows 744 units in-transit (P1: 533, P3: 211). Demand has been relatively stable across the provided samples (avg ~445) and game history (avg ~244). The significant drop in observed demand vs. historical samples (averaging 508 in pre-game samples vs. 244 in game history) indicates a regime shift or a difference in the 'game demand' versus 'sample demand'. I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate demand based on the actual game history. I will assume lead time is 2 (default) but monitor the P1 shipment. If P1 is truly lost, the OR engine will eventually re-order as on-hand + in-transit drops below the base stock. Currently, 299 on-hand + 744 in-transit = 1043 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand (avg 244).

Carry-over insight: Potential lost shipment: Period 1 order (533 units) overdue as of Period 5 (expected Period 3). Game demand regime (avg 244) significantly lower than pre-game history (avg 508).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing SKU 706016003 (Skinny Denim). Analysis of the history reveals a critical supply chain issue: the order placed in Period 1 (533 units) is now 3 periods overdue (promised 2, actual elapsed 5) and is highly likely lost. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (lead time = 2). Current on-hand inventory is 119. Demand history shows a stark regime shift: the pre-game samples averaged 508 units/week, whereas the game history (last 5 periods) averages 231 units/week (246, 296, 222, 212, 180). This downward trend is sustained, likely due to post-holiday seasonality or product lifecycle. To address the lost shipment and prevent stockouts while considering the demand drop, I will use a recent demand window (N=5) to set mu_hat. This targets the current regime (~231/week). I will use 'explicit' for L=2 to signal to the OR backend that the promised lead time is still the standard, but use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the lower volatility of the current regime compared to the pre-game data.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Period 1 order (533 units) lost. Current demand regime (Periods 1-5) stable at avg 231, significantly lower than pre-game history avg 508. Seasonal decline for denim trousers confirmed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Analysis of the product (Skinny Denim Trousers) and current date suggests a seasonal decline as warmer weather approaches. Historical demand has shifted from a pre-game average of 508 to a game-period average of 222 (Periods 1-6). Period 6 ended with 0 inventory due to a stockout (demand 178, sold 119). Regarding lead times: Order P1 (533 units) is definitively lost. Order P2 arrived in 2 periods. Order P3 (211 units) was placed in P3, and with a promised lead time of 2, was expected in P5. It is now Period 7 and P3 has not arrived, making it 2 periods overdue; it is likely lost or significantly delayed. There are 744 units in-transit (Orders from P4-P6 were 0 units, so 'In-transit' reflects remaining balances of P1, P2, P3 plus any backend adjustments). Since we are out of stock and current demand is stable around 200-230, I will use recent history (N=6) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout while accounting for the likely loss of the P1 and P3 shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (211 units) is now 2 periods overdue and likely lost, following the confirmed loss of the Period 1 order. Demand remains stable in the low-200s range, confirming the post-February seasonal drop.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). Previous observations indicate a severe reliability issue with shipments: Period 1's order was lost, and Period 3's order (211 units) is now 3 periods overdue (expected Period 5), confirming it is also lost. Period 2's order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). Demand has consistently declined since entering February/March, stabilizing in a lower regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods is approx 208, with the most recent 3 periods averaging 162. Given the stockout (on-hand=0) and the high loss rate of shipments (2 of 3 initial orders lost), I need to account for the risk of missing pipeline inventory. Pipeline currently shows 794 units: P3(211-lost), P4(0), P5(0), P6(0), P7(50), plus P8's pending order. Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline, and because 211 units of that pipeline are effectively non-existent, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and higher volatility caused by recent stockouts. I will stick to L=default (2) as the successful P2 shipment adhered to this, but the OR parameters will need to compensate for the lost units in the pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 3 order (211 units) confirmed lost (overdue by 3 periods). Significant pipeline discrepancy: out of 794 units 'In-transit', 211 are ghost units from the lost P3 order.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: Date is 2019-04-08. Demand has dropped significantly from the pre-game January average (~508) to a stable regime (P4-P8) of ~166 units per week. This aligns with seasonal cooling for denim trousers after the early spring peak. Supply chain issues persist: P1 (533 units) and P3 (211 units) orders are confirmed lost. P7 arrived early (lead_time 1). Current on-hand is 0. Total 'In-transit' is 744, but this includes 533 (P1) and 211 (P3) lost units totaling 744 'ghost' units. Effectively, the net pipeline is 0 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full raw 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock, it will see 744 units in transit and order nothing. To force an order to cover the next 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~500 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit value. mu_hat is set to cover 3 periods of the current 166-unit regime plus the 744 ghost units [ (166 * 3) + 744 = 1242 ]. This ensures the OR calculation [base_stock - pipeline] results in a positive order despite the ghost units. Sigma_hat is calculated for 3 periods based on a standard deviation of ~30 observed in the current regime [sqrt(3)*30 approx 52].

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination: 744 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P1=533, P3=211). Forecast mu_hat must be adjusted upward by 744 to neutralize the OR backend's pipeline subtraction until these units are cleared or offset.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the inventory situation is critical. On-hand is 0. The total in-transit is 1208 units, but 744 of these are confirmed lost (Period 1 order of 533 and Period 3 order of 211). The OR backend calculates 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because it believes the 744 lost units are still coming, it will under-order unless we artificially inflate mu_hat. Demand has stabilized at a lower seasonal level: the mean for Periods 6-9 is 139 units. With a promised Lead Time (L) of 2, the review+lead window is 3 periods. Normal mu_hat would be 3 * 139 = 417. To neutralize the 744 'ghost' units in the backend's subtraction, I am setting mu_hat to 417 + 744 = 1161. L is set to calculated to reflect the variability (Lead Time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to capture the lower volatility of the current seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline contamination persists: 744 units of the 1208 'In-transit' are confirmed losses (P1 and P3). Demand regime has shifted down significantly since April (Avg Periods 6-9 = 139).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, we are managing the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS' in late April. Demand has shifted into a lower regime, with the average of the last 4 completed periods (P7-P10) being 108.5 units. However, we have a significant pipeline contamination issue: 744 units from lost shipments (P1: 533 units, P3: 211 units) are still treated by the OR backend as 'In-transit'. This artificially inflates the 'pipeline inventory' and causes the backend to under-order. To neutralize this, I must set 'mu_hat' to (Expected Demand for L+1 periods) + 744. With L=2, L+1=3. Expected demand: 3 * 108.5 = 325.5. Adjusted mu_hat = 325.5 + 744 = 1069.5. Lead time L is set to calculated based on recent arrivals (P7 and P9 both arrived in 1 period, while promised is 2). Demand volatility (sigma) is based on the recent 4-period regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 10: Late April demand (Periods 7-10) stabilized at avg 108.5 (-53% from previous regime). Lost units P1(533) and P3(211) totaling 744 continue to contaminate pipeline calculations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), the SKU (High-waisted skinny denim) is in a low-demand regime. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 98.6 units, but the most recent two periods (P10-P11) have dropped further to an average of 57 units, indicating a late-spring seasonal trough for this product type. A major complication is 'pipeline contamination': the system shows 772 units in-transit, but 744 of these are confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (533) and Period 3 (211). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 772 units from its base_stock target, it will under-order unless I use an 'explicit' mu_hat to neutralize the ghost inventory. The current on-hand (350) covers over 6 periods of the current demand rate (avg 57). However, to prevent the backend from being effectively paralyzed by the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I set an explicit mu_hat. Calculation: Projected demand for L+1 (3 periods) is 57 * 3 = 171. To counteract the 744 ghost units, I add them to the target: 171 + 744 = 915. Sigma is set to reflect the recent volatility (std of last 5 periods ~ 39) scaled for L+1, roughly 68.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime trough: April avg demand (Periods 10-11) is ~57 units, down from March avg (~150). Total ghost units in pipeline remain 744.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13 (2019/05/06), we are managing a jade skinny denim trouser. Current inventory is 229 units with 772 units in-transit. A persistent issue remains: 744 units in the pipeline (from Period 1 and Period 3 orders) are confirmed lost and never arrived. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (772) from the base stock. To prevent under-ordering, we must neutralize these 'ghost' units. Current demand regime (Periods 10-12) shows an average demand of 78.3 units per period (55, 59, 121), showing a slight rebound in late April/early May compared to the dead trough of ~57 units. I will set the lead time L to the default promised value (2). For mu_hat, I will use the 'explicit' method to set a base stock target that accounts for the ghost units. Calculation: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Ghost_Units. Using a forecasted demand of 85 (anticipating a slight seasonal uptick for May) and L=2: (3 * 85) + 744 = 999. This ensures the OR logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) yields (999 - 772) = 227 units of coverage, which is appropriate for ~2.7 periods of demand at the current rate. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher volatility seen in the most recent demand spike (121).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the item (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is in a low-demand trough typical of late spring/early summer for heavy denim. Demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) has averaged 70 units, but the most recent period was only 45. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this low mean while allowing for some variability. The pipeline inventory is currently 875 units, but 744 of these units (orders from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost and have not arrived for 11+ periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 875 from its base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to neutralize these 744 ghost units. The base calculation for the target stock is (1+L) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2, mean=70, and sigma~40 (calculated from recent volatility), a standard base stock would be ~300. To offset the 744 ghost units that the backend will subtract, I set mu_hat to 1044 (300 + 744). This ensures the backend places an order if logic dictates, rather than being paralyzed by fake pipeline inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed 1-2 period actual arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed demand trough (Avg P10-P13 = 70 units). Ghost units from P1(533) and P3(211) totaling 744 remain 'In-transit', requiring explicit mu_hat inflation to bypass OR backend logic.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 15 (May 20). Demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14: 55, 59, 121, 45, 46) averages 65 units/period, confirming a low-demand late-Spring trough. The pipeline contains 959 units, but 744 of these (P1=533, P3=211) are confirmed lost shipments that have never arrived and likely never will. The OR backend subtracts the full 959 units from its base_stock target of [mu_hat + z*sigma_hat]. To ensure the system orders enough to cover actual demand, I must neutralize the 744 'ghost' units. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I calculate the target for (1+L) = 3 periods based on recent demand (3 * 65 = 195) and add the 744 offset, totaling 939. This ensures the backend sees a required inventory level that accounts for the fact that 744 units of the 'In-transit' figure are effectively non-existent. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=5) to capture current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Pipeline contamination by 744 ghost units (P1, P3) persists. Demand trough confirmed for May (Avg P10-P14 = 65). mu_hat must continue to be explicitly inflated by 744 to prevent under-ordering due to false pipeline data.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 16 (2019/5/27). Demand remains in a stable trough (Avg P10-P15 = 64.2 units). Pipeline status: On-hand 79, In-transit 959. However, 744 of the 'In-transit' units are confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (533) and Period 3 (211). The OR backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory). If we allow the backend to use the contaminated pipeline value of 959, it will stop ordering entirely until the 744 ghost units are cleared. To neutralize this, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target inventory level by 744 units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = ((1 + L) * Expected Demand) + Ghost Units. With L=1 (recent performance) and expected demand ~65, Base Stock = (2 * 65) + 744 = 874. Setting mu_hat to 874 forces the OR engine to place an order that treats the 744 ghost units as non-existent. Lead time L is set to 1 period based on the most recent successful arrivals (P7 and P9).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Pipeline contamination by 744 ghost units (P1, P3) persists, necessitating explicit mu_hat inflation of +744 to maintain target stock levels. Demand regime is stable at ~65 units/week.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/06/03), denim demand remains in a seasonal trough. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P10-P16) is 63.1 units per week. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 959 units. However, history confirms that Period 1 (533 units) and Period 3 (211 units) orders are lost, totaling 744 'ghost units' that will never arrive. The true pipeline consists of the orders from P13 (103 units), P14 (84 units), and any subsequent orders that haven't arrived yet. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting these 744 ghost units from the target base stock (base_stock - pipeline = order), I must explicitly set mu_hat to (Predicted Demand * (1+L)) + 744. Predicted demand for L=2 (3-week coverage) is 63 * 3 = 189. Adding the 744 ghost units offset yields a mu_hat of 933. Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent volatility during the trough (std ~28 over P10-P16) adjusted for the 3-period horizon (sqrt(3)*28 \u2248 48).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. Demand has stabilized in a 'trough' regime since late April, with an average demand of approximately 50-60 units per period (Avg P13-P17 = 50.6). Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0). The primary operational challenge remains 'pipeline contamination': 744 units from lost shipments in Period 1 (533 units) and Period 3 (211 units) are still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. As total In-transit is 991, the true legitimate pipeline is only 247 units (991 - 744). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter. The target base stock for a (L+1=3) period window at a mean of 55 units is ~165 units. However, because the backend subtracts the full 991 pipeline units, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that fills the gap. I will use the established strategy of adding the 744 ghost units to the forecast to neutralize the backend's deduction. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 2, as recent Legitimate arrivals (P8, P10) show 1 period, suggesting the promised 2 is a safe upper bound.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Pipeline contamination by 744 ghost units (P1, P3) persists. Demand trough for late Q2 confirmed (Avg P13-P17 = 51). Strategy remains focused on explicit mu_hat inflation (+744) to bypass backend inventory logic.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), the current demand regime for Jade HW Skinny Denim is stable at a low trough, typical for mid-summer. The average demand over the last five periods (P14-P18) is 46.8 units. The main operational challenge remains the pipeline contamination: 744 ghost units (P1=533, P3=211) are permanently 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The OR engine subtracts these 744 units from its order calculation. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 991. Excluding the 744 ghost units, the actual physical pipeline is 247 units (P13=103, P14=84, P17=32, P18=0 plus possible recent P15/P16 orders and the current P19 order). To neutralize the 744-unit subtraction by the backend, I must explicitly increase mu_hat by +(744). Given L=2 (3 periods of coverage: R+L), the base mu_hat for a demand of ~47/week should be 141. Adding the 744 offset, the explicit mu_hat is set to 885. Sigma_hat is calculated for 3 periods based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Pipeline contamination by 744 ghost units (P1, P3) remains the primary driver for explicit mu_hat inflation (+744). Demand regime is stable at ~47 units/week during the June trough.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The demand for product 706016003 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) has reached a seasonal trough, stabilizing at approximately 22-26 units per week in the most recent periods (Periods 18-19). The primary structural issue remains the 744 'ghost' units in-transit (Period 1 order of 533 units and Period 3 order of 211 units), which were confirmed lost months ago but still count against the pipeline inventory in the OR engine. To force the engine to order correctly for the upcoming 3-period cycle (L+1), I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover the demand for Periods 20, 21, and 22. With current demand around 24 units/period, the real base stock should be ~75-80 units plus safety stock. However, since the engine subtracts the 991 units in-transit (which includes 744 ghost units and 247 real units from orders in P13, P14, and P17), I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - in_transit' results in a positive order if on-hand is zero. To bypass the 744 ghost units specifically, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + 744). Using a forecasted demand of 25/week and L=2, the base stock should be about 3*25 = 75 units. Thus, mu_hat = 75 + 744 = 819. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the low volatility of this trough regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Continued explicit mu_hat inflation (+744) required to neutralize lost shipments from P1 and P3. Demand continues to reflect a mid-summer trough (~25 units/week).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a mid-summer trough for denim trousers (Period 21, July 1st). The demand regime for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is stable at a very low average of 33.2 units/week. The pipeline inventory continues to be contaminated by 744 'ghost units' from Period 1 (533 units) and Period 3 (211 units) which are confirmed lost. The backend logic calculates 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. To ensure any real units are ordered, we must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target stock by 744 units, effectively neutralizing these ghost units. Without this inflation, the backend will incorrectly assume we have 744 units coming and will place zero orders despite our zero on-hand inventory. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P8, P10) showed a shift to 1-period delivery, though promise remains 2. This helps the OR backend use a more accurate historical lead time average.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: July trough demand confirmed (~33 units/week). Total ghost units in pipeline remain 744 (P1, P3), requiring continued explicit mu_hat inflation (+744) to bypass backend inventory logic.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a mid-summer demand trough (July) for the 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' product. Demand over the last 4 periods (P18-P21) has averaged 21 units/week. The primary operational challenge remains the 'pipeline contamination' caused by two lost shipments from Period 1 (533 units) and Period 3 (211 units). These 744 units appear in the 'In-transit' total of 991 but will never arrive. The OR backend's order logic is: order = base_stock - (On-Hand + In-Transit). With In-Transit inflated by 744 ghost units, the backend will refuse to order anything unless base_stock exceeds the ghost total. To solve this, I continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method, setting it equal to the desired base stock (inventory needed to cover L+1 periods of demand at ~21 units/week plus safety stock) PLUS the ghost units (744). Using a target base stock of ~100 units for this demand level, I set mu_hat to 844. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed historical speed of successful shipments (often 1-2 periods), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture the lower volatility of the current regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a mid-summer demand trough (July), with mean demand around 25-35 units per week based on recent history (P20-P22). A critical issue remains: 744 ghost units from Period 1 (533 units) and Period 3 (211 units) are permanently lost but still included in the 'In-transit' total of 991 units. The REAL pipeline inventory consists of only 247 units (991 total - 744 ghost). The OR engine subtracts the full 991 from the base stock calculation, resulting in zero orders and stockouts (on-hand is 0). To fix this, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) at ~30 units/week would be roughly 90-110 units. However, I must inflate this value by +744 to neutralize the ghost units. Total mu_hat = (90 forecast) + 744 = 834. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the low volatility in this regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24 (late July), demand for denim trousers has surged significantly, jumping from 34 units in Period 22 to 102 units in Period 23 (+200%). This likely marks the transition from the mid-summer trough to the precursors of back-to-school demand. Inventory is currently critical at 0 units on-hand. The pipeline inventory of 991 units is heavily contaminated by 744 ghost units (P1: 533, P3: 211) that are confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline is only 247 units (991 - 744). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be explicitly set to include an inflation of 744. I am forecasting demand at 100 units/week for the next 3 weeks (L+1). Calculation: (3 * 100) + 744 = 1044. sigma_hat is set to 150 to accommodate the increased volatility and ensure a high service level as demand recovers.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Significant demand recovery observed (102 units in P23), ending the summer trough. Forecast regime updated to ~100 units/week for the start of the back-to-school season. Continued +744 explicit inflation of mu_hat required to offset ghost units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 29, 2019. We are entering the back-to-school season for denim trousers. Demand has surged from a June/July trough (~20-30 units) to 102 units in Period 23 and 171 units in Period 24. This confirms a significant demand regime shift upward as expected for the end of summer. I estimate the new baseline demand to be approximately 150-170 units per week. 

Pipeline calculation: The 'In-transit' figure of 1291 units contains 744 'ghost units' from lost orders in Period 1 (533) and Period 3 (211). These units will never arrive but are subtracted from the base stock by the OR backend. To neutralize this, I must inflate mu_hat. 

Target mu_hat calculation: (Promised Lead Time L=2 + 1) * Estimated Demand (~160) + Ghost units (744). 
(3 * 160) + 744 = 480 + 744 = 1224. 

I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1224 to ensure the backend actually orders units to cover the seasonal surge despite the pipeline contamination. I have set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the increased volatility of this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed (Demand P23: 102, P24: 171). Estimated regime shift to ~160 units/week. Ghost units (744) continue to necessitate explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at August 5 (Period 26), entering the core of the back-to-school season. Demand has surged significantly: P23 (102), P24 (171), and P25 (246). This confirms a strong upward trend. The current demand regime for the start of August is estimated at ~250 units/period. The pipeline total is 1420 units, but it contains 744 'ghost' units from confirmed lost segments (P1: 533, P3: 211) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from our base stock target, so we must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to neutralize these 744 units. Target calculation: Base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~250 units/period (Total = 750). Adding the 744 ghost offset gives a mu_hat of ~1494. This ensures the backend (1494 - 1420) produces the necessary order to meet the current surge while on-hand inventory is at zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Strong back-to-school surge confirmed. Demand increased from 102 (P23) to 246 (P25). New regime mean estimated at 250 units/week. Ghost units (744) remain in the pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the back-to-school season has clearly shifted upward, with the last four periods showing demand of 102, 171, 246, and 213 (Average ~183). I expect this to remain high through August. Pipeline contamination of 744 ghost units (lost orders P1 and P3) still persists in the OR backend's inventory calculations. To neutralize this and ensure the system orders enough stock for current demand, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Base target: With L=2, the total required for (L+1) periods (3 weeks) at an estimated demand of 220/week is 660 units. Pipeline adjustment: I must add the 744 ghost units to this target to bypass the backend subtraction (Order = Target - (Inventory + Pipeline)). Inflation calculation: 660 + 744 = 1404. I will set mu_hat (the (L+1) period demand) to 1400. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to provide a sufficient safety buffer during this volatile growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Back-to-school demand regime stable at ~200 units/week (Avg P24-P26 = 210). Ghost units (744) continue to necessitate explicit mu_hat inflation of ~1400 total to reach target stock levels.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19. We are in the 'Back-to-School' high demand season for Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS. Demand for the last 5 periods (P23-P27) has been 102, 171, 246, 213, 160, averaging 178 units/week. However, the last three weeks average is higher at ~206. We expect this level to persist or slightly rise as we move deeper into August/September. The pipeline is heavily contaminated with 744 ghost units (P1: 533, P3: 211) that will never arrive. The OR backend calculates 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. With 'In-transit' at 1683, the backend sees an inflated pipeline. To neutralize the 744 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Base stock target: (1+L) * demand_forecast. Lead time (L) is consistently 2. Target for 3 weeks (L+1) at 210 units/week is 630. To reach this despite the 744 ghost units and the current (1683-744) real in-transit, I set mu_hat explicitly to ~1450 to ensure an order is triggered to meet actual demand. The cap also restricts order size, so consistent pressure on mu_hat is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand regime stable at ~200 units/week (Avg P24-P27 = 197). Offset for 744 ghost units remains mandatory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-09-02. We are in the post-back-to-school phase. Recent demand has significantly increased, with Period 28 at 344 and Period 29 at 264, though earlier August demand was around 200. The average of the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is 245.25. The core challenge remains the 744 ghost units (P1=533, P3=211) that contaminate the 'In-transit' figure of 1683. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline from its target stock calculation; therefore, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Target stock level (TSL) calculation: mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost_Units. With a forecast of 245 per period and L=2, the required mu_hat is 3 * 245 + 744 \u2248 1479. This ensures that the engine, after subtracting 1683 units (of which 744 are fake), still aims for a physical stock/pipeline of approximately 735 real units (3 periods of coverage).

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn regime confirmed (Avg P26-P29 = 245). Ghost units (744) remain in pipeline. mu_hat inflation logic is maintained to stabilize order flow despite data contamination.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 9, 2019. We are in the post-back-to-school maintenance phase. Recent demand (P28-P30) has been consistently strong (344, 264, 173), averaging 260 units. I will estimate the current regime mean at 250 units/week. The pipeline inventory (1591 units) is heavily contaminated by 744 ghost units (P1: 533, P3: 211) that will never arrive. The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). To neutralize the -744 impact of ghost units, I must artificially inflate the base_stock calculation by setting mu_hat such that 'expected demand' (which the backend treats as (1+L)*mu) includes this 744 unit offset. Given Promised L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods), I need mu_hat to be [(250 * 3) + 744] / 3 = 498. This ensures the OR engine's subtraction of 1591 (of which only 847 is real) results in a target level that matches actual stock needs. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20% of demand to handle volatility.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school/Autumn regime mean confirmed at ~250 units/week (based on P26-P30 history). Total ghost units (P1, P3) remain 744, continuing to necessitate explicit mu_hat inflation of approximately +248 per period in the (1+L) calculation.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in the Autumn/Back-to-School phase. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), the average demand is approximately 213.5 units/week. However, historical samples from early in the year (Jan-Feb) showed demand as high as 750, suggesting potential for further growth as we approach late Q3 and Q4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1591 is heavily contaminated by 744 ghost units (P1: 533, P3: 211) which will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline is 847 units (1591 - 744). To neutralize the OR backend's logic, which subtracts the full 1591 from the target stock, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. Since the OR engine calculates the base stock as (1+L)*mu_hat, and L=2, the total target stock is 3*mu_hat. To add 744 units to the order, I must increase mu_hat by 744/3 = 248 units. Setting a base demand forecast of 250 (to account for the current regime and potential growth) plus the 248 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 498. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 140 for 3 periods) to ensure a high service level given zero current stock and volatile recruitment-season demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late September period (2019/9/23). Historical demand for the Autumn regime (Periods 26-32) has averaged 201 units/week, though recent weeks (P31-32) show a softening trend (127 and 88 units). I will set the base demand forecast (mu_hat) to approximately 180 units/week to account for this cooling. Ghost units from Period 1 (533) and Period 3 (211) still contaminate the pipeline inventory (Total = 744 ghost units). The OR backend calculates 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. At a lead time of 2, (1+L) = 3. To offset the 744 ghost units that the backend incorrectly subtracts, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by roughly 744 / 3 = 248 units. Therefore, the explicit mu_hat is 180 (forecast) + 248 (offset) = 428. Lead time calculation is set to 'calculate' to capture the 2-3 period variance observed. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture the volatility of the Autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P26-P32) mean revised to ~200 units/week with a recent downward trend in late September. Total ghost units in pipeline remain 744 (P1, P3).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 34 (Sep 30). We observe a massive demand spike in P33 (881 units), which is likely a data outlier or a specific seasonal flash sale, as it deviates significantly from the previous 'Autumn regime' of ~200 units/week. However, the skiny denim category often sees volatility in late September/early October. Pipeline contamination remains at 744 ghost units (P1: 533, P3: 211). Total 'In-transit' is 1571; after subtracting 744 ghost units, the actual 'Clean Pipeline' is 827 units (which includes a large order from P24 or P26 that hasn't concluded yet). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 744 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Forecast: The avg demand of the last 8 periods (P26-P33) is ~284 (heavily skewed by P33). Excluding the outlier P33, the mean is ~199. I will use a conservative forecast of 300 units/period to account for some sustained increase while including the +744 offset. Formula: mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Offset = (1 + 2) * 300 + 744 = 1644. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Massive demand spike observed in P33 (881 units), deviating from the ~200 avg regime. Investigation required to see if this is a sustained shift or outlier. Pipeline contamination of 744 ghost units remains active.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/10/7. We are in a high-demand autumn/pre-holiday phase for denim trousers. Recent demand has spiked massively: P33 (881) and P34 (590), compared to the previous regime of ~250. This suggests a secondary seasonal peak or a response to inventory shortages (unmet demand leading to spikes when stock is expected). On-hand is 0, and In-transit is 2056. Crucially, the pipeline contains 744 'ghost' units from lost shipments P1 (533) and P3 (211) that will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline from its target, meaning it will under-order unless we inflate mu_hat. I will set the base demand forecast to 350 (averaging the recent spike with the previous baseline to be realistic but responsive) and add an 'inflation' of 248 units per period (744 / (1+L) where L=2) to neutralize the ghost units. Total mu_hat = (350 + 248) * 3 = 1794. Sigma_hat is set explicitly higher to 250 to account for recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed secondary seasonal demand spike in late Sept/early Oct (Avg P33-P34 = 735). Total ghost units (P1, P3) remain 744 in pipeline, requiring continued explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand period (mid-October), with a recent spike averaging 603 units over the last 3 periods (P33-P35: 881, 590, 338). Although the most recent demand (338) suggests the peak may be cooling, base demand is significantly higher than the summer trough. The primary operational challenge remains the 744 'ghost' units in-transit (P1=533, P3=211) that are confirmed lost. These units contaminate the OR backend's pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), leading to systemic under-ordering. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to the (Forecasted Demand * (1 + L)) + Ghost Units. Using a lead time L=2, and a conservative forecast of ~250 units/week for the upcoming period (aligning with pre-spike levels), the calculation is: (250 * 3) + 744 = 1494. This ensures the OR engine places an order that targets the actual physical requirement despite the false pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high recent volatility (CV ~0.4).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Seasonal demand spike observed in late Sept/early Oct is subsiding (P35 demand 338 vs P33 demand 881). Re-stabilizing forecast to ~250 units/week. 744 ghost units (P1, P3) continue to necessitate explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 37. Demand remains high but looks to be stabilizing after the late Sept/early Oct spike (P33: 881, P34: 590, P35: 338, P36: 407). The average of the last 4 periods is 554. However, I expect demand to moderate further back towards the autumn baseline of ~250. My primary constraint remains the 744 ghost units (P1=533, P3=211) still in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 2056). To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to a level that exceeds (In-transit + On-hand). With current In-transit at 2056 and On-hand at 0, and a promised lead time (L) of 2, the backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock and orders (base_stock - 2056). To target an arrival of ~400 units, I need base_stock to be approximately 2450. Using L=2, mu_hat needs to be explicitly set to 2400 (which is (1+L) * 800) to force an order through this pipeline contamination. This strategy prioritized ending a stockout over the risk of holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed demand peak subsiding; setting baseline regime at ~300. 744 ghost units continue to contaminate pipeline, requiring high explicit mu_hat values to trigger any replenishment ordering.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016003 is experiencing a high-demand autumn regime with recent samples (P33-P37) averaging ~537 units/week, though showing significant volatility. Pipeline inventory is heavily contaminated by 744 ghost units (P1, P3). In-transit inventory is currently 3243 units. If we subtract the 744 ghost units, the true pipeline is 2499 units. With an estimated baseline demand of ~400 units/week for late October/early November, a target base stock for 3 periods (L+1) would be ~1200 units. Since the true pipeline (2499) already exceeds even the most aggressive capture of recent demand spikes, no new orders are required. The OR backend will see 3243 'In-transit' and naturally stop ordering. To prevent an accidental order if the backend uses a very high sigma, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current high-demand state but allow the pipeline inventory to naturally bridge the stock-out until the massive P37 order (1187 units) arrives.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed secondary seasonal peak in Oct (Avg P33-P37: 537). Potential lead time variance noted (P35 arrived in 1 period, P30 in 2, P27 in 3). 744 ghost units remain in pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are entering the November/early December period. Historical demand analysis shows a secondary seasonal peak in October (Avg P33-P38: 523 units), which appears to be sustaining. On-hand inventory is 732, but pipeline contamination persists with 744 ghost units (P1, P3). Total observed In-transit is 2056 units; adjusting for ghost units, the functional pipeline is 1312 units (2056 - 744). The OR backend calculates base_stock as (1+L)*mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and then subtracts 'In-transit' to determine the order. Since 'In-transit' is inflated by 744 units, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to ensure the backend reaches the desired base stock level of ~1800-2000 units (covering 3 periods of 600+ demand). I will set mu_hat to 2600 (approx. 620 units/week real demand * 3 periods + 744 ghost units) to trigger defensive replenishment as we approach the final periods of the year.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), we are moving deeper into the Q4 peak season for skinny denim. Historical demand shows a significant seasonal peak in October (Avg P33-P37: 537) which has slightly moderated in late October/early November (Avg P35-P39: 383). The current demand regime is set to 400 units/week to maintain a healthy safety stock during this high-volume period. A persistent challenge is the 744 'ghost units' from lost orders P1 and P3, which continue to inflate the 'In-transit' pipeline. To force the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) to place an order, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. My target base stock is approximately 1450 units ((1+L)*400 + safety). With 'On-hand' at 486 and corrected 'In-transit' at 1677 (2421 - 744), the backend sees a total inventory of 2163, which is greater than the target, thus it won't order. To trigger a replenishment order of approximately 300 units, I set an explicit mu_hat of 2500. Lead time (L) is kept at 2, reflecting recent arrivals (P37 and P35 arrived in 1 period, but P30 took 2 and P27 took 3).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed secondary seasonal peak subsiding to a stable Q4 baseline of ~400 units/week (Avg P35-P39: 383). Pipeline contamination of 744 ghost units remains a permanent factor requiring explicit mu_hat inflation for all replenishment cycles.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late Q4/Pre-holiday season (Nov 18). Demand has stabilized at a significantly higher baseline compared to the summer trough, with the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging ~376 units/week. However, the OR backend logic is still contaminated by 744 'ghost' units from lost orders in P1 (533) and P3 (211) that remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 2421. These units will never arrive but are subtracted from the target base stock. To maintain a target inventory that covers approximately (L+1) weeks of demand (with L=2, that's ~1200 units), I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to neutralize the 744 ghost units plus the current on-hand inventory of 184. Given In-Transit = 2421 (Actual 1677 + Ghost 744), and On-Hand = 184, the total observed inventory by the backend is 2605. To trigger any order for a target stock of ~1200, mu_hat would need to exceed 2605. Since we have sufficient real pipeline (1677 units) arriving from P34 and P39 to cover current demand, I will set mu_hat to a value that maintains appropriate safety stock without over-reacting to the peak, using an explicit value that accounts for the ghost pipeline while estimating 400 units/week demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (late November), demand for denim trousers is stabilizing at a Q4 level of approximately 280 units/week (Avg P39-P41 = 274). Pipeline contamination remains a critical issue: 744 ghost units from P1 and P3 are still included in the 'In-transit' figure (2056). This makes the effective pipeline 1312 units. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously subtracting these 744 non-existent units from the target base stock, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter. With a promised lead time of 2, the backend uses a (1+L) = 3 factor. Applying an offset to mu_hat: Target mu_hat = (Foreast * 3) + 744. Using a forecast of 280, the calculation is (280 * 3) + 744 = 1584. I set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high historical volatility (recently ~80-100 units/week, sqrt(3)*80 \u2248 140). This ensures the order logic triggers enough replenishment to maintain service levels through December.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Stabilized late Q4 demand regime at ~280 units/week. Permanent pipeline contamination of 744 ghost units remains, requiring explicit mu_hat inflation logic to maintain inventory levels.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand spike in P42 (627 units). This spike likely relates to late November sales (e.g., Black Friday/Cyber Monday). Historically, December demand for denim trousers tends to stabilize or slightly decline after these peaks, but must be maintained to avoid lost sales. The pipeline contains 2056 units 'In-transit', but 744 of these are confirmed ghost units (from lost orders in P1 and P3). To effectively bypass the OR backend's logic of subtracting 'In-transit' from the target base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers expected demand AND accounts for the 744 ghost units. Using a base demand forecast of 300 units/week (stabilized Q4 baseline), the required base stock is (1+L)*300 \u2248 900. To offset the 744 ghost units, mu_hat is set explicitly to 1650 (900 + 750). This should trigger an order to replenish the safety stock depleted by the P42 spike, while the lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability seen in recent weeks (1-3 periods).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09 (Period 44). We are in the late Q4 demand regime. Recent demand (P42-43) has shown high volatility (627 units in P42, 143 units in P43), following the Black Friday/Cyber Monday period. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is approximately 318 units. However, we must address the persistent inventory data issue: 744 'ghost' units from lost shipments in Period 1 (533) and Period 3 (211) remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 2105). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting these 744 units from the target base stock, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter. With a base demand forecast of ~250 units/week and a lead time of 2, the expected mu_hat would be (1+2)*250 = 750. Adding the 744 offset, the explicit mu_hat is set to 1494. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen in the last few weeks of the year.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 (mid-December), facing a late Q4 demand regime. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: P42 (627), P43 (143), and P44 (283). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 325.8 units/week. The critical issue remains the 744 'ghost units' (lost orders from P1 and P3) that persist in the in-transit pipeline (2105 units total). The OR backend subtracts this 2105 from the base stock to determine the order. Since 744 of those units will never arrive, we must inflate the 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order. Target stock level for (1+L)=3 periods at ~325 units/week plus safety stock (approx. 1100 total) minus 'true' pipeline (2105 - 744 = 1361) would normally result in no order. To bypass the backend's logic and trigger replenishment for the remaining two periods of the game, I set mu_hat explicitly to the current in-transit level (2105) plus a buffer for upcoming demand. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the phantom inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019), approaching the final period of the game next week. Recent demand history (P41-P45) shows values of 274, 627 (Black Friday week spike), 143, 283, and 247, averaging 314 units/week. However, excluding the outlier spike, the baseline remains around 230-250 units. The pipeline inventory is currently 3385 units, but 744 of those are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1 and 3, which never arrived and never will. This leaves an effective pipeline of 2641 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 3385 units when calculating orders. Since the game ends next period (P47), we must ensure enough inventory arrives for that final week of sales. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. The large order of 1329 from P45 will arrive in P46 or P47. Given the impending game end, we set mu_hat explicitly to the current regime mean (approx 250) multiplied by (1+L) plus the 744 ghost units to prevent the backend from halting orders due to 'dirty' pipeline data, though at this late stage, new orders may not arrive in time.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Final phase adjustment. Ghost units (744) remain in pipeline. Demand stabilized at approx 250 units/week for December (excluding BF spike).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 is the final period. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 3385 units, most of which includes a large order from Period 45 (1329) and lingering lost units (744 ghost units). Demand in the final weeks of December (P46: 89) has dipped significantly compared to earlier in the month. Since this is the last decision period and any order placed now will arrive after the game ends (given the 2-period promised lead time), I am setting parameters to effectively place a zero order. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat with a value that is much lower than the current pipeline (including ghost units) to ensure no additional capital is tied up in unnecessary inventory for the final calculation.
