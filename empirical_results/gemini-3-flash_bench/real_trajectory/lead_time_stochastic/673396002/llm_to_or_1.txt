Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a women's belt ('Ringo hipbelt'). Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows a peak in early January (407, 374) followed by a sharp drop and stabilization in early February (295, 130, 213). This drop-off likely reflects the post-holiday/New Year clearance period ending. Given we are in mid-February, near Valentine's Day, demand might see a slight uptick or stabilize. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. I will use recent_N=3 for the demand forecast to capture the more recent, lower demand levels (average ~213) rather than the January peaks, ensuring we don't over-order based on holiday volume. Promised lead time is 2, so the base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). In Period 1, we ordered 349 units, but since the promised lead time (L) is 2 periods, they are correctly in-transit and not yet arrived. The historical demand shows a downward trend from early January (peaks of 407, 374) to more moderate levels lately (213 on Feb 4, 115 in Period 1 on Feb 11). Given the product is a grained imitation leather belt (staple/accessories), the high January demand might have been related to post-holiday sales or specific promotions. Current demand is lower. To set parameters for the OR backend: 1) L is set to default (2). 2) Mu_hat: I will use the most recent 3 samples (Feb 4: 213, Feb 11: 115, and the average of the Jan samples) to avoid over-ordering based on the high January peak while acknowledging the recent drop. Let N=3. 3) Sigma_hat: I will also use N=3 to capture the recent volatility. The on-hand is currently 0, meaning we lost 115 units of potential sales in Period 1. This is expected as we started with 0 inventory.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history shows a declining trend from January peaks (hitting 130 in late Jan) followed by a slight recovery (213 on Feb 4). The first observed demands in the game (P1: 115, P2: 169) suggest an average demand around 140-150 for this belt. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because our first order (placed P1) is scheduled to arrive in Period 3 (Promised lead time = 2). The 'In-transit' quantity of 589 matches our P1 (349) and P2 (240) orders. To ensure we cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current review period (L+1=3), and considering the historical samples (avg ~280) vs recent game samples (avg ~142), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (the last history point 213 plus P1 and P2) to normalize the forecast toward the current trend. For sigma_hat, I'll use all samples to capture the higher volatility seen in the product's history. L remains at the promised default of 2 until we confirm actual arrival timing.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Looking at the history, we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all demand so far (Periods 1-3) because no shipments have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (placed at the start of P1) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Since 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0, the Period 1 order is delayed. Total in-transit is 831 (349+240+242). Demand is currently moderate (115, 169, 140). Given the delay, I will keep L at default for now but monitor for lost shipments next period. For demand, the pre-game samples (avg ~284) were higher than the recent 3 periods (avg ~141). Using a recent_N of 5 including late pre-game and early game samples provides a balanced forecast of approximately 189/week. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 samples (P-1 to P3) to reflect this lower demand regime compared to January.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4560.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Reviewing the history: The order from Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 2), but the order from Period 1 (349 units) is notably missing despite the promised lead time of 2. It should have arrived in Period 3. This missing shipment has caused a stockout, as seen in Period 4 where demand (314) exceeded the arrived inventory (240). Total in-transit is 591, which accounts for the Period 1 order (349) and Period 3 order (242). Given that Period 1 is now 2 periods overdue, it is likely lost or significantly delayed. Demand shows an upward trend (115, 169, 140, 314). The jump to 314 in early March suggests a seasonal shift into Spring fashion for this accessories SKU. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand to capture this recent increase, and set L=2 as the confirmed lead time from the successful Period 2 delivery, while acknowledging the backend will account for the pipeline (including the potentially lost P1 order). I will use explicit values to ensure we cover the current higher demand level.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/03/18). Looking at the history, the product is a women's belt. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). However, the Period 1 order (349 units) is significantly overdue (was expected in Period 3). This suggests a possible lost shipment or severe delay. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 854 (P1: 349, P3: 242, P5: 263). Because P1 is likely lost, the OR's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation will be inflated by 349 units, leadings to under-ordering. To compensate, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Demand history shows mean ~238 (samples: 407, 374, 295, 130, 213 from seed; 115, 169, 140, 314, 96 from history). Period 4 saw a spike (314), but Period 5 dropped (96). Given the stockouts (sold hits inventory cap), true demand is likely higher than the 'sold' units. I will set L=2. mu_hat = (1+L) * 240 = 720. I will keep sigma_hat at default to handle volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (349 units) is likely lost (now 3 periods past promised lead time); OR backend pipeline inventory remains inflated.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing inventory: On-hand is 129 units. In-transit is 782 units. Looking at histories, Period 1 order (349 units) is a confirmed lost shipment (placed P1, promised lead time 2, now P7 and never arrived). Period 2 order arrived in P4 (LT=2). Period 3 order (242 units) is currently 2 periods overdue and likely lost or significantly delayed. Period 5 order arrived in P6 (LT=1). The 'In-transit' figure on the OR backend (782) includes these lost units (349 + 242 + 191), which prevents the system from ordering enough. Demand context: Observations (407, 374, 295, 130, 213, 115, 169, 140, 314, 96, 134) show high variance but an average around 217. With a lead time of 2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods, roughly 650 units. Because the backend thinks pipeline is 782, it will order 0. To force an order, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Ghost inventory = 349 (P1) + 242 (P3) = 591 units. Target base stock = 650. I'll set mu_hat to 1241 (650 + 591) to ensure the backend places an order. I will use LT=2 as the baseline.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 (349 units) and Period 3 (242 units) orders are confirmed/highly likely lost; combined 591 units of 'ghost' inventory are inflating the OR backend pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU has 0 on-hand inventory. The history confirms significant delivery issues: Period 1 (349 units) and Period 3 (242 units) are significantly delayed/lost (missing for 7 and 5 periods respectively), while Period 2 arrived with L=2 and Period 5 arrived with L=1. These lost 591 units create 'ghost inventory' in the OR backend's pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), leading to under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus the 591 lost units. Based on recent demand (approx. 130 per week) and historical pre-February averages (300+), I'll forecast demand at 200/unit/week. Thus, mu_hat = (200 * 3) + 591 = 1191. I will use the default for L as there is no consistent evidence of a permanent shift from 2, and sigma_hat is set to explicit to account for the high volatility seen in early samples.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost Periods 1 and 3 (591 units) continues to depress OR order logic; mu_hat must be adjusted upward until these units are flushed or replaced.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). On-hand inventory is 489. In-transit shows 792 units, but based on historical analysis, 591 of these are 'ghost' units from lost orders in Period 1 (349 units) and Period 3 (242 units). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to calculate orders; since it sees 792 in-transit, it will under-order significantly because it believes 591 units are coming that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline is current in-transit (792) minus ghost inventory (591) plus recent arrival logic, roughly 201 units. To force the backend to place an order despite these ghost units, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat. Mean demand over the last 8 periods is ~165. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should cover 3 periods (~495 units). However, I must add the 591 ghost units to this target to offset the backend's subtraction. Target mu_hat = 495 + 591 = 1086. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed: 591 units from Periods 1 and 3 are lost but remain in OR pipeline inventory. Offsetting via inflated mu_hat until inventory logic resets or shipments are purged.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 (2019/4/15). Demand for the last 5 periods (96, 134, 130, 239, 87) averages 137.2 units. The 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (349 units) and Period 3 (242 units) is still in the OR backend's 'Pipeline Inventory' because it never arrived and has not been cleared. This 591 units of ghost inventory is greater than the target base stock, which would cause the OR engine to place zero orders. To force an order, I must set mu_hat (explicitly) to include both the expected demand for (L+1) periods AND the 591 units of missing stock that the backend thinks we have. Expected demand for 3 periods (L=2) is ~411 units. Adding the 591 units of lost stock gives a required target of ~1002 units. Lead time observation: Recent arrivals occurred at L=1 and L=2; I will use L=2 (promised) to be conservative. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility (~54 units per period).

Carry-over insight: Sustained ghost inventory of 591 units (P1: 349, P3: 242) continues to block OR logic; mu_hat must remain inflated by ~590 units to offset these lost shipments until they are purged from the system.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019-04-22). The product is a women's belt. Demand has cooled significantly over the last three periods (87, 60), following a higher average earlier in the spring. More importantly, we have 591 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 1: 349, Period 3: 242) that are long overdue and confirmed lost, but still reside in the OR backend's 'In-transit' bucket. This pipeline inventory prevents the logic from ordering necessary stock because it thinks we are over-provisioned. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the true demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) to be around 240 units (80 units/period). To bypass the 591 ghost units, I add them to the forecast: 240 + 591 = 831. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the 591 units of ghost inventory, allowing the system to place orders if on-hand stock drops further. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained ghost inventory (591 units) remains in the system. I will continue to offset this by inflating mu_hat by ~591 units until the pipeline is purged or inventory level needs a significant refresh.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/29. Demand has consistently decelerated over the last four periods (87, 60, 53). Mean demand for the recent regime (P9-P11) is approx 67 units/period. The pipeline inventory remains at 591 units, which corresponds to the lost shipments from P1 (349) and P3 (242). These 'ghost' units have not been purged and continue to mislead the OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline). To prevent the backend from stopping orders entirely, I must maintain an inflated mu_hat. This inflation equals (Promised L + 1) * Forecasted Demand + Ghost Inventory. Observed lead times are mostly 1-2 periods. I will use L=2. Calculation: mu_hat = (2+1)*67 + 591 = 792. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 591 units that will never arrive. On-hand inventory is healthy (555), covering approx 8 weeks of demand at current rates, so no aggressive order is needed, but the parameter must be set to prevent logic failure in future periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/6. Demand has stabilized at lower levels over the last 4 periods (averaging 67 units/week) following a late-March peak. The primary issue remains 'ghost inventory': 591 units from Period 1 (349) and Period 3 (242) are lost but remain in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. Because the OR backend uses 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', these 591 ghost units effectively block it from ordering until on-hand inventory is depleted or base_stock is significantly raised. Current on-hand is 488 units. With actual recent demand around 67/week, we have ~7 weeks of stock. To prevent the backend from being 'blinded' by lost shipments when pipeline-correction is needed, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the horizon (L+1 = 3 periods) plus the lost 591 units. Recent mean demand is ~67; so (3 * 67) + 591 = 792. This ensures the OR logic doesn't prematurely stop ordering once the 488 units deplete further. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect the lower volatility in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Ghost inventory (591 units from P1 and P3) remains in system; offsetting via inflated mu_hat until inventory logic is cleared or stock levels require a reset.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 673396002 is currently in Period 14. We are managing a persistent 'ghost inventory' issue where 591 units (from Periods 1 and 3) are stuck in the 'In-transit' pipeline and likely lost, as they are now over 10 periods past the promised lead time of 2. Because the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will continue to order 0 units as long as it believes these 591 units are coming. To force an order, I must inflate mu_hat to cover the expected demand (L+1 periods) PLUS the 591 lost units. Current demand has stabilized after a peak in early April; the last 4 weeks show a mean of ~59 units. For a lead time of 2, the expected demand is 3 * 59 = 177 units. Adding the 591 unit offset, the required mu_hat is 768. Current on-hand is 432, which is higher than the natural target, so this inflation serves to maintain safety stock and prevent stockouts once the current on-hand depletes, while waiting for the system to eventually flush the lost units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 15 (May 20, 2019). Analyzing recent demand (Periods 9-14), the weekly demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the initial surge in March. The last 6 weeks' demand values are [87, 60, 53, 67, 56, 76], averaging ~66.5 units per week. The promised lead time is 2, so the OR engine logic seeks to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~200 units). However, the system still reports 591 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 3 that are confirmed lost/ghost inventory). These 591 units exceed the required base stock, causing the OR engine to order 0 units and gradually deplete current on-hand inventory (356 units). Although the on-hand inventory is currently sufficient to cover over 5 weeks of demand, we must continue to offset the 591 in-transit units to allow the OR engine to eventually trigger orders when on-hand drops too low. Currently, on-hand (356) > target safety stock (~200). Therefore, I will maintain an inflated mu_hat to negate the ghost inventory effect, ensuring the backend logic doesn't remain paralyzed once the 356 units are consumed.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16 (2019/05/27), we face two critical issues. First, the 'ghost inventory' of 591 units (from lost Period 1 and Period 3 orders) still resides in the OR backend's pipeline inventory. These units will never arrive, but they prevent the backend from ordering new stock. Second, Period 15 showed a sharp demand spike to 309 units, after several weeks of low demand (~60 units). This spike coincides with late May, likely a seasonal shift. With only 47 units on hand and a lead time of 2 periods, we are at severe risk of stockouts. To force the OR backend to order despite the 591-unit ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 1000. Under the (L+1) logic, this target base stock (approx 1000) should exceed the ghost inventory (591) + on-hand (47), triggering an order of approximately 360 units to cover the observed demand trend. I will use 'calculate' for L as lead times have been 1-2 periods, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in the last period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: The SKU '673396002' (Ringo hipbelt) is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) after a significant demand spike in Periods 15 (309) and 16 (376), likely driven by early summer fashion trends. Total in-transit is 1106 units. However, as noted in previous carry-over insights, 591 units from Periods 1 and 3 are effectively 'lost' but remain in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. This ghost inventory artificially lowers new orders. To ensure the backend places an order that restores on-hand levels despite this ghost stock, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: The mean demand of the last 5 samples is ~177 units. For a lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock coverage is (1+L)*mean = 3 * 177 = 531. To offset the 591 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1122 (531 + 591). I use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility while maintaining the standard safety stock logic. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the varied arrival times (1-2 periods) observed in the history.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We have entered a high-demand regime starting in mid-May (Period 15), with the last three periods showing demand levels of 309, 376, and 412. This aligns with seasonal peaks for accessories. The 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 and Period 3 (591 units) remains in the 'In-transit' figure of 1044. Actually, only the Period 17 order (453 units) is expected to arrive (it was ordered with a promised lead time of 2). However, recent lead times have been 1 period (Period 16 arrived in Period 17). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this new ~400 units/period demand despite the 591 units of ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat to explicitly include the forecast for the review + lead time periods (3 periods total * 400 = 1200) PLUS an offset of 591 to neutralize the ghost inventory. Total mu_hat = 1791. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to manage the volatility of the new demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg increased from ~60 to ~365. Ghost inventory of 591 units (P1, P3) still persists in pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 15, moving from a low of ~60 units to a high of ~360 units per period. The last four periods (P15-P18) show demands of 309, 376, 412, and 338 (average ~359). I will use N=4 to capture this 'recent' high-demand regime. Additionally, 591 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are confirmed lost ('ghost inventory') as they are over 15 periods overdue. These ghost units inflate the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory', causing it to under-order. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window at 359 units/week is ~1077. To force the backend to place an order despite the 591 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1668 (1077 + 591) to ensure the backend sees a requirement that accounts for the missing stock. Sigma_hat is set to 200 based on recent volatility to ensure a high service level.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Ringo hipbelt has entered a high-volume regime starting at Period 15, likely driven by summer seasonality (late June). Mean demand since P15 is approx 395 units per period. The pipeline currently shows 591 units from Periods 1 and 3 that are definitely lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend. To ensure the system orders enough units to cover the current high demand, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to offset these 591 'ghost' units. The calculation for mu_hat is based on (1+L) * expected demand + ghost units. With a lead time L=1 (recent arrivals in P17, P18, P19 have all been 1 period) and expected demand of 400, the target is (1+1)*400 + 591 = 1391. I will use 'explicit' to force this level. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a buffer for the recent volatility (range 309-533).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory of 591 units (from P1 and P3) still persists in pipeline as of P20. High demand regime (avg ~400) stable for 5 periods (P15-P19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 15. The recent demand (P15-P20) averages approximately 400 units per week. Additionally, there is a persistent 'ghost inventory' of 591 units from lost orders in Period 1 (349 units) and Period 3 (242 units). Because these units remain in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count (pipeline inventory) but will never arrive, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure the OR logic places orders. The required base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand, which at 400 units/period is 1200 units. To offset the 591 ghost units, I set an explicit mu_hat of 1791 (1200 + 591). I am using explicit sigma_hat based on the standard deviation of the last 6 periods (~75 units per week), adjusted for (L+1) periods using sqrt(3) * 75 \u2248 130. Current on-hand is 0, and actual in-transit (excluding ghost units) is 840 units (P19=213, P20=174, P17=453? No, P17 order arrived? Checking history: P17 order of 453 is still in transit, P19 order of 213 is in transit, P20 order of 174 is in transit. Total = 840 units). Including ghost units, the pipeline is 1431.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '673396002' (Ringo hipbelt) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 15 (May 2019), with an average demand of approximately 397 units over the last 7 periods (P15-P21). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 2005 units in-transit. A critical issue remains: 591 units from Period 1 and Period 3 are long-lost but remain in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation (ghost inventory). This ghost inventory causes the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2. I will use L=2 (promised) to be safe. My target base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of the current demand (~397 * 3 = 1191 units) plus an offset for the 591 ghost units. Total target base stock \u2248 1782. I will set mu_hat explicitly to achieve this target, while sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed in this high-demand regime (standard deviation ~76 in recent weeks, scaled by sqrt(L+1)).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), we observe a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 15 (May 20). The demand for this Ringo hipbelt (Womens Accessories) in June/July has averaged approximately 396 units per week (P15-P22). We must continue to account for 591 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (349 units) and Period 3 (242 units) that are confirmed lost but still occupy 'In-transit' space in the OR backend's logic, which would otherwise prevent it from ordering sufficient stock. The lead time has been fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods; I will use a 2-period lead time estimate (L=2) for safety. To ensure the backend places orders that cover the actual demand (approx. 400/week) while overcoming the 591-unit pipeline inflation, I set mu_hat to an explicit value. The calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Weekly Demand + Ghost Inventory. With L=2 and Demand=400, Target Base Stock = (3 * 400) + 591 = 1791. Since the backend calculates base_stock as (1+L)*mu_hat, I provide mu_hat = 1791 / 3 = 597. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime (P15-P22).

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (591 units from P1 and P3) persists as of P23. High demand regime (avg ~400) remains stable from P15.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P15-P23) shows a significant shift, with demand averaging approximately 370 units per week. The last two periods (P22-P23) show a slight cooling (296 and 275 units), suggesting we should anchor our forecast on the most recent high-demand period. I will use a recent_N of 9 for mu_hat to capture the regime since Period 15. The 'ghost inventory' of 591 units from Periods 1 and 3 remains in-transit in the system, which artificially inflates the pipeline inventory viewed by the OR backend. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method. My target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand plus the ghost inventory offset. Target base stock = (370 * 3) + 591 = 1701. Since the OR engine calculates base stock as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and given the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set mu_hat to 1600. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 591 ghost units and the current 299 on-hand/666 real in-transit units. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22, P23) have consistently been 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (591 units from P1 and P3) still persists in pipeline as of P24. High demand regime (P15-P23) average is ~370, showing slight deceleration in the last 2 weeks.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 673396002 is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around P15. While demand spiked to ~533 (P19), it has settled into a range of 210-296 over the last three weeks (avg ~260). The 'ghost inventory' of 591 units (from P1 and P3) still persists in the in-transit pipeline (Total In-transit: 1530). This ghost inventory significantly inflates the OR backend's perception of pipeline stock, leading it to under-order. To counteract this, I must set 'mu_hat' using an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand for the (L+1) period window AND adds back the 591 lost units. With L=2, the window is 3 periods. Current local demand mean is ~260. Forecasted window demand = 3 * 260 = 780. Adding the 591 units to offset ghost inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of ~1371. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility during this high-demand summer phase without over-reacting to the P19 spike. Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22, P23) confirmed lead times of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak: Avg demand P22-P24 is ~260 units, down from P15-P21 avg of ~400. Ghost inventory (591 units) remains the primary driver for mu_hat inflation.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a stabilized post-peak demand regime. Average demand for the last 4 periods (P22-P25) is approximately 235 units (296, 275, 210, 159), showing a clear downward trend from the earlier summer peak (~400 units). The pipeline currently contains 1543 units, but 591 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1 and P3) that will never arrive. The OR backend's order logic subtracts this pipeline from the target base stock. To maintain a functional base stock of ~705 units (based on L=2, covering 3 periods of 235 units), I must inflate the mu_hat by the amount of the lost units. Total required base stock = (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Units. With L=2, (1+2)*235 + 591 = 1296. Thus, mu_hat = 1296. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR logic places an order that accounts for the current stock-out and demand trend while bypassing the pipeline error.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation for Period 27: We have 0 on-hand inventory and 1543 units in-transit. Based on the history, 591 units (from P1 and P3) are permanently lost ('ghost inventory') but are still counted by the OR backend as pipeline inventory. Additionally, recent orders from P24 (273 units) and P25 (13 units) were expected but haven't arrived yet (typical lead time is 1-2 periods). Demand has shifted from a high-summer peak (~400 units, P15-P21) to a lower stable regime. The last 5 periods (P22-P26) show an average demand of 222.8 units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this demand while overcoming the 591-unit 'ghost' deficit in its internal logic, I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) window. With L=2, the total expected demand is ~668 units. Adding the 591 unit offset, mu_hat is set to 1259. Sigma_hat is calculated based on the standard deviation of recent demand (~59) scaled for (L+1), resulting in ~102.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a stabilized post-peak demand regime (averaging ~180-200 units over the last 3 periods: P25-P27). On-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 1530 units. Crucially, 591 units from Periods 1 and 3 are confirmed lost but remain in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, and the 453 units ordered in Period 17 (now 11 periods ago) are also clearly lost. This brings total 'ghost inventory' to 1044 units (591 + 453). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My base forecast for demand over the (L+1) period (where L=2) is approximately 600 units (200 * 3). To offset the 1044 units of ghost inventory that the backend subtracts, I will set mu_hat to 1644 (600 + 1044). This ensures the order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful order despite the corrupted pipeline data. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the varied delivery times observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Revised Ghost Inventory: Total lost units now estimated at 1044 (P1: 349, P3: 242, P17: 453). These units permanently inflate pipeline inventory and must be countered by mu_hat inflation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state with zero on-hand inventory and a demand spike (Period 28 demand = 422). The primary challenge is the 'ghost inventory' \u2013 undelivered orders from Period 1 (349), Period 3 (242), Period 17 (453), and now potentially Period 24 (273). Total ghost inventory is estimated at 1317 units (349+242+453+273). This ghost inventory inflates the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory', preventing it from placing necessary orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset it. Current demand is volatile but shows a resurgence (422 units in P28). I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. Using L=2, (3 * 300) + 1317 \u2248 2217. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force the backend to account for both the lost shipments and the recent high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Revised Ghost Inventory: Total units likely lost or significantly delayed is now estimated at 1317 (P1, P3, P17, and P24) as P24 is now 4 periods past order date without arrival. This total must be added to mu_hat to trigger ordering.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), the SKU is facing a significant shortfall in stock (0 on-hand) despite an 'In-transit' figure of 2629 units. Detailed analysis of history confirms a pattern of lost shipments: Period 1 (349), Period 3 (242), Period 17 (453), and Period 24 (273). These four orders total 1317 'ghost' units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in pipeline inventory, preventing needed orders. Demand has also entered a significant late-summer/early-fall uptick, with the last two weeks (P28-P29) averaging 483 units, compared to the previous stabilized average of ~200. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to cover both the expected demand for the lead time (3 * 480 = 1440) and the ghost inventory correction (1317). Total mu_hat = ~2750. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent spike in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Revised Ghost Inventory: Total units lost or permanently delayed is now 1317 (P1, P3, P17, P24). P24 (273 units) is now 6 periods past its order date with no arrival, confirming its loss. Demand has surged to >400 units/week over the last 2 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime (avg > 400 over the last 3 weeks: 422, 544, 491). We have 0 on-hand inventory and a significant backlog of demand. The inventory pipeline is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: Period 1 (349), Period 3 (242), Period 17 (453), and Period 24 (273), totaling 1317 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (2994) but will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock to determine orders, it will under-order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for these 1317 ghost units. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * expected_weekly_demand + ghost_offset. With L=2 and expected demand ~480, (3 * 480) + 1317 \u2248 2757. I will set mu_hat to 2800 to ensure the OR engine places a large enough order to replenish stock and cover the high seasonal demand while overcoming the pipeline blockage.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand regime (Sept 2019), with demand averaging ~460 units over the last 4 periods (P28-P31: 422, 544, 491, 354). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is listed as 3270 units, but a significant portion of this is 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Based on the history, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1 (349), P3 (242), P17 (453), and P24 (273), totaling 1317 units. Additionally, the P29 order (856 units) and P30 order (608 units) are currently 2 and 3 periods past their order dates respectively; while P30 is only 2 periods out (within promised lead time), the failure of P29 to arrive at L=2 (which would have been visible this period) is concerning. The OR backend uses (Base Stock - Pipeline), so the 1317 'ghost' units prevent it from ordering. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+Review) demand plus the ghost inventory to force the OR engine to place an order. Expected demand for 3 periods (L=2, Review=1) is ~460 * 3 = 1380. Adding the 1317 ghost units equals 2697. I will set mu_hat to 2700 to ensure replenishment starts.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total ghost inventory remains at 1317 units (P1, P3, P17, P24). P29 (856 units) did not arrive at L=2; if it does not conclude next period, it will be added to the ghost total. High demand regime (avg 463) confirmed for periods 28-31.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P28-P32) shows a high average of ~413 units (422, 544, 491, 354, 257). The last observation (P32: 257) suggests a potential deceleration, but given the critical shortage history, I must ensure high coverage. Ghost inventory assessment: P1 (349), P3 (242), P17 (453), and P24 (273) are confirmed lost, totaling 1317 units. Additionally, P29 (856 units) ordered on 2019/8/26 is now 4 periods past its order date (L=2 promised) and has not arrived; it is likely lost or significantly delayed. Adding P29 to the ghost inventory brings the total to 2173 units. This 'ghost' pipeline prevents the OR backend from ordering. To trigger replenishment, I set mu_hat to explicitly cover (1 + L) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory offset. Forecasted demand for (1+2)=3 periods is ~1240 units (using ~413/period). mu_hat = 1240 (demand) + 2173 (ghost inventory) = 3413. sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value (350) to maintain a safety buffer against volatility and lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Revised Ghost Inventory: Total units lost or permanently delayed increased to 2173 (P1, P3, P17, P24, and now P29). P29 (856 units) is 4 periods past order date with no arrival, confirming a major supply break.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track significant 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) that permanently inflate the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing it from ordering sufficient stock. As of Period 34, the total ghost inventory is 2,173 units (P1: 349, P3: 242, P17: 453, P24: 273, P29: 856). P29 is now 5 periods past its order date with no arrival, confirming its loss. To counter this 2,173-unit deficit, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Units). Current demand is stable in a high regime (avg ~350-450). A base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) at 400 units/period equals 1,200. Adding the 2,173 ghost units brings the required target to ~3,373. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the backend sees enough nominal demand to trigger an order despite the 3,362 'in-transit' units visible in the status.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4182.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. Based on historical data, orders from P1 (349), P3 (242), P17 (453), P24 (273), and now P29 (856) have never arrived and are well past their promised 2-period lead time. This total (2173 units) remains in the OR engine's 'pipeline' and prevents it from placing new orders. To force the OR backend to order, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds this pipeline inventory plus the expected demand for the lead-time period. Current on-hand is 36. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 3450. Known lost/ghost units are 2173. This means 'real' in-transit is roughly 1277 (orders from P33 and P34). Current demand is averaging around 300 units/week (P31-P34 avg: 300). For a 2-period lead time (L=2, meaning 3 periods of risk), we need mu_hat to cover (1+2)*300 = 900 units. Adding the ghost inventory (2173) to this requirement, the explicit mu_hat should be at least 3073. We'll set it at 3500 to ensure we trigger sufficient replenishment and clear the pending stockout risk as on-hand is nearly zero.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory effectively increased to 2173 units as of Period 35 (confirmed losses: P1, P3, P17, P24, P29). These units remain in the backend pipeline and must be offset by mu_hat inflation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits significant supply chain volatility and erratic demand. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system indicates an 'In-transit' quantity of 3765 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, at least 2173 units are confirmed lost or permanently delayed (Periods 1, 3, 17, 24, 29). Additionally, orders from Period 33 (976 units) and Period 34 (88 units) have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, Period 33 is now 3 periods past its order date (should have concluded at START of P36 if LT=2). Given the history of lost shipments, Period 33 might be at risk, but for now, I will treat the 2173 units as the primary 'ghost' inventory. Demand has decelerated from the peak (>400) to a more moderate level (~250 avg over last 3 periods). To force the OR backend to order despite the 3765 in-transit units (which include the 2173 ghosts), I am setting an explicit mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (Forecasted Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Forecasted demand is ~250. With L=2, (250 * 3) = 750. Adding 2173 ghosts = 2923. I will set mu_hat to 2923 to ensure the backend sees a requirement higher than the inflated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Period 33 order (976 units) is now 1 period past its promised lead time (L=2) without arrival; monitoring for potential addition to ghost inventory. Total confirmed ghost inventory remains 2173 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1789.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, two shipments arrived: Period 33 (976 units, lead_time=3) and Period 35 (315 units, lead_time=1). This significantly improves the on-hand inventory to 1137 units. However, my 'ghost inventory' analysis remains critical. The confirmed lost units from Periods 1, 3, 17, 24, and 29 total 2173 units (349+242+453+273+856). These units are permanently stuck in the OR backend's 'pipeline inventory' calculation, preventing it from placing new orders unless mu_hat is sufficiently inflated to exceed this phantom stock. Demand has softened recently (avg of last 3 periods: ~180), but the immediate priority is ensuring the backend doesn't starve the location once the current on-hand stock is depleted. I will maintain an inflated mu_hat of 2600 (approx. 2173 + 2.5 periods of demand) to keep the pipeline moving. L is set to explicit 2 as recent arrivals have averaged out to the promised lead time despite the Period 33 delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Period 33 order (976 units) arrived at L=3, while Period 35 arrived at L=1, keeping average lead time near 2. Confirmed ghost inventory remains 2173 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a lower demand regime compared to the September peak, with demand over the last four periods (P34-P37) averaging 173.75 units. Despite this, total units lost ('ghost inventory') from P1, P3, P17, P24, and P29 remain in the backend pipeline, totaling 2,173 units. These units permanently inflate the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR engine, preventing it from ordering even as on-hand inventory (980 units) depletes toward zero. To counter this, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the 2,173 ghost units to the forecast for the review + lead time (3 periods). Forecast demand for 3 periods at 175 units/period is 525. Adding 2,173 results in 2,698. This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the phantom pipeline inventory, allowing the backend to place replacement orders. Lead time L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P33 at L=3, P35 at L=1) average out to the promised lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 673396002 is currently in a lower demand regime compared to the peaks seen in September. The last three periods (P36-P38) show demand of 154, 157, and 98, averaging ~136. However, the backend OR logic is severely compromised by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P17, P24, and P29) totaling 2173 units. These units are counted in the pipeline but will never arrive, causing the OR engine to stop ordering even when on-hand inventory depletes. Current on-hand is 882 units, which is sufficient for approximately 6 weeks at current demand rates. Because the ghost inventory (2173) is so large, I do not need to inflate mu_hat this period; the existing on-hand stock is more than enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand trend (avg ~145) while monitoring the stock for the eventual depletion that will require a massive mu_hat offset to overcome the 2173-unit pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P36-P38) has stabilized at a lower level (~135 units/period) after the September peak. Ghost inventory remains at 2173 units.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Ringo hipbelt has stabilized into a lower regime (approx. 115 units/period) following the September peak. On-hand inventory is currently high (786 units) due to massive arrivals in Period 36. However, use of the OR backend requires accounting for 'ghost inventory'\u2014confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 17, 24, and 29 totaling 2173 units. These units remain in the backend's 'in-transit' calculation, causing it to incorrectly believe the stock position is sufficient. To counter this and allow the backend to potentially order in the future, mu_hat must be inflated. Since on-hand inventory (786) is currently sufficient to cover direct demand for the next ~6 weeks, I will set mu_hat to cover both the expected demand (115 * 3 = 345) and the ghost inventory (2173), totaling 2518. Sigma is calculated based on recent stability (approx. 30 units standard deviation).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 673396002 has entered a stable, lower-demand regime following the late-summer/early-autumn peak. Over the last five periods (P36-P40), demand has averaged approximately 115 units, with the most recent three periods (P38-P40) averaging only 88 units. Currently, there are 715 units on-hand, which covers over 6-8 periods of current demand. Additionally, There is a 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 2173 units (confirmed losses from P1, P3, P17, P24, and P29) that will never arrive but continues to prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders. However, with the current high on-hand balance relative to low demand, no new orders are immediateley required. To ensure the system transitions correctly once on-hand stock is depleted, I will maintain 'mu_hat' with a high enough buffer to offset the 2173 ghost units, while using 'recent_N' for demand to reflect the current decelerated pace.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Current demand (P38-P40) has decelerated further to an average of ~88 units/period. High on-hand inventory (715 units) provides a sufficient buffer for approximately 8 weeks, mitigating the immediate risk posed by the 2173 units of ghost inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (Period 38-41) has successfully stabilized at a much lower average of ~84 units/period following the September peak. On-hand inventory is currently 643 units, which provides approximately 7-8 periods of coverage at this lower demand rate. This healthy stock level significantly mitigates the risk posed by the 2,173 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P17, P24, and P29) that remain stuck in the backend's pipeline calculations. Because the backend expects that massive in-transit volume to arrive, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to exceed the pipeline + on-hand totals. However, given our high on-hand stock and the low demand, there is no immediate need to force an order. I will continue to hold mu_hat at a level that prevents unnecessary ordering while monitoring the drawdown of the current stock. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent low-demand stability (avg 84 * (1+L) = 252) but the OR engine will subtract the 2,173 ghost units and the 643 on-hand, resulting in no order, which is the desired outcome.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift post-peak: Period 38-41 average demand is 84 units/period, a significant drop from the ~460 average in September.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 673396002 has shifted into a low-volume regime post-peak, with recent weekly demands (P38-P42) of 98, 96, 71, 72, and 122 units, averaging ~92 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 521 units is sufficient to cover approximately 5.6 periods of this new demand level. However, the system's pipeline is currently inflated by 2,173 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P17, P24, and P29). These lost units remain in the OR backend's calculation of pipeline inventory, effectively preventing it from placing any new orders. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds the (pipeline + on-hand) inventory minus current safety stock requirements. Given on-hand (521) + ghost (2173) = 2694, mu_hat needs to be higher than this to trigger an order. However, with 521 units on-hand and demand averaging <100, we have over 5 weeks of safety. I will continue to use a high mu_hat (explicitly set to 2800) to ensure that if a real stock-out risk appears, the system can bypass the ghost inventory hurdle. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P36) showed a mix of 3 and 1 periods, averaging 2.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 673396002 (Ringo hipbelt) has stabilized at a significantly lower level post-harvest/autumn peaks. Average demand over the last 6 periods (P38-P43) is approximately 92 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 428 units, which covers more than 4 weeks of current demand. However, the backend 'In-transit' figure is 2474 units, which includes 2173 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P17, P24, and P29). These units will never arrive but remain in the pipeline logic, preventing the system from ordering. While current on-hand stock is sufficient for now, the OR backend must be 'tricked' into viewing the pipeline as empty relative to the target stock level. To achieve this, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the required safety stock for the current period. With L=2 and current demand ~92/week, the actual requirement is ~276 units. By setting mu_hat to 2550 (approx. ghost inventory 2173 + required stock ~377), I ensure the backend logic stays active without triggering a massive over-order, as the capped policy will limit the order size based on mean demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019. We are in a stable post-peak demand regime (P38-P44) with an average demand of approximately 97 units per period. The 'ghost inventory' phenomenon persists: 2,173 units (from P1, P3, P17, P24, and P29) are unaccounted for and remain in the backend's 'in-transit' calculation, preventing it from placing new orders. With 299 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~100 units/period, we have approximately 3 periods of coverage. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we are approaching a point where a new order will be necessary to avoid a stockout in P47 or P48. To bypass the ghost inventory block, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2445. This value is calculated as ((1+L) * forecast) + ghost_inventory = (3 * 97) + 2173 = 2464. I will slightly moderate this to 2445 to ensure the OR engine initiates a small replenishment order now that on-hand levels have finally depleted below the safety threshold. L is kept at default (2) as recent arrivals (P33, P35) averaged near the promised duration.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). Demand has shown a moderate uptick over the last two periods (P44: 129, P45: 216) likely due to the holiday season, though it remains significantly lower than the September peak. The current inventory status shows 83 units on-hand and 2474 units 'In-transit'. However, 2173 of those 'In-transit' units are confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P17, P24, and P29). Subtracting this ghost inventory (2474 - 2173) reveals an actual pipeline inventory of 301 units, comprising the P34 order (88 units) and P35 order (expected, though P35 was actually reported as arriving in P36). Re-calculating: P34 (88 units) is extremely late (ordered 12 periods ago) and P35 (315 units) already arrived. Effectively, our real pipeline is nearly zero if we assume P34 is also lost. With 83 units on-hand and demand trending up (avg of last 3 periods ~146), we risk a stockout. I will set L=default (2) and mu_hat using 'explicit' to 2610. This value is derived by taking the current demand forecast of ~146 units/period * (L+1) = 438, and adding the 2173 ghost units to bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction logic. This ensures a fresh order is placed to cover the holiday demand and replenish safety stock, effectively 'pushing through' the ghost inventory blockage.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Period 34 order (88 units) is now 12 periods past its order date and is likely lost, increasing the total estimated ghost inventory to 2261 units (2173 + 88).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the final period (P47, 2019-12-30). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a slight uptick in the last two weeks (216, 197), averaging ~206, following a low-regime average of ~84 (P38-P43). There is a significant 'ghost inventory' of 2,261 units in the pipeline (confirmed losses P1, P3, P17, P24, P29, and now P34) which prevents the OR backend from ordering unless mu_hat is massively inflated. The current in-transit (2684) minus ghost inventory (2261) leaves a 'real' pipeline of 423 units (ordered in P46 and P47 logic). Since this is the final period of the simulation, the priority is to maximize sales for this week while minimizing ending inventory. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to override the logic; a value of 2500 is used to ensure the OR backend ignores the 2684 in-transit units and places an order to cover the current week's expected demand (approx 200 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Final simulation period. Ghost inventory total remains 2261 units. Recent demand (P45-P46) has increased to ~206 units/period compared to the previous ~84 units/period.
