Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-02-11. We are looking at SKU 399223035 (Jeggings). Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows an upward trend (57, 73, 88, 73, 96). Average demand over these 5 weeks is 77.4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent upward trend in the last 5 samples. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). Looking at the historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 11), the sequence is: 57, 73, 88, 73, 96, 156. The most recent demand (156) is a significant spike (over 60% increase from the previous week), possibly due to seasonal transition or promotion for Jeggings (Ladies' Denim category). The promised lead time (L) is 2. The order placed in P1 (103 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in P3 (visible in P4's start). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 103 in-transit. Demand is currently outstripping supply (P1 demand was 156, we sold 0). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend in demand while maintaining responsiveness to volatility. L will stay at default (promised 2) until data suggests a drift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU is 'Jeggings H.W', a staple denim item. Historically (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand averaged 77.4 units/period. However, in the last two periods (P1, P2), demand spiked to 156 and 124 (avg ~140), likely due to a seasonal shift toward spring fashion. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have missed sales in P1 and P2 (demand was 280 units total). There are 282 units in-transit (103 from P1, 179 from P2). The promised lead time is 2. Following the timing rules: the P1 order (ordered P1) should arrive during P3. We will only see confirmation of this in the P3 conclude message at the start of P4. Therefore, it is too early to assume the lead time has slipped or orders are lost. I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods of demand (recent_N=2) to capture the higher demand regime, and using default for lead time and sigma. This will signal the OR backend to maintain enough stock for the current (L+1) period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: average demand increased from ~77 to ~140 (+80%) coinciding with the transition to February/Spring inventory cycles.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is Jeggings, a staple item. Looking at the history, the promised lead time is 2 periods. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order was placed Feb 11, we expect it to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4). However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that either the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Total in-transit is 420 units (P1: 103, P2: 179, P3: 138), but on-hand is 0, leading to significant stockouts. Demand shows high variance since February began (156, 124, 76), averaging 118.6 over the last three periods. Given that the P1 order (ordered 3 periods ago) has not arrived, I will explicitly set L=3. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the February demand regime while ignoring the lower January pre-game samples. This increases the base stock to cover the extended lead time and high current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trend: Promised L=2 but P1 order (3 periods ago) has not arrived as of P4 start; actual lead time is likely >= 3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 11, 2019. The SKU is 'Ladies Jeggings'. Looking at the demand history: pre-February demand averaged 77, but February demand (Periods 1-2) spiked significantly (156, 124). However, the most recent two periods (Periods 3-4) show a cooldown (76, 64), suggesting the initial 'Spring' spike might be stabilizing to a lower mean. Lead time: The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2), confirming the promised lead time holds for that shipment. However, the Period 1 order (ordered 4 periods ago) is still missing ('arrived=0' in all conclude messages), suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. Because on-hand inventory (115) is finally positive but demand has dropped, I will use recent_N=3 for demand (avg ~88) to avoid over-ordering while accounting for the recent stabilization. I will use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the variance between the missing P1 order and the successful P2 arrival.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (103 units) confirmed lost/missing: 4 periods elapsed with no arrival message. Demand stabilized to ~88 units/period across the last 3 periods following the Feb spike.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing Jeggings. Analysis of the history shows that the Period 1 order (103 units) is confirmed lost, as the Period 2 order (179 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2) while P1 never did. Demand has stabilized after an initial spike (Feb 11 and Feb 18 saw 156 and 124 units), with the last three periods (Feb 25 - Mar 11) averaging 70.67 units (76, 64, 72). Considering the historical data provided (Jan: 57-73, Feb: 156-124-76, Mar: 64-72), there is a clear trend toward stabilization around 70 units per week entering Spring. I will use N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent stabilization while excluding the initial February spike. I will use the promised lead time L=2 for parameters, as the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. On-hand is 43, in-transit is 296 (excluding the lost P1 order). With profit and holding cost both at $1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR engine will aim for.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Demand Stabilization confirmed: Avg demand for last 3 periods is ~71 units, down from early Feb peak of ~140. Lead time for the only successful delivery (P2 order) was exactly 2 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). On-hand inventory is 0 after stockout in Period 6. Historical demand for the last 4 periods (64, 72, 92, and the seed data ending in 96) indicates a stable regime. The average demand across Periods 4-6 is 76 units. Although Period 1 (103 units) is confirmed lost, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The pipeline currently contains orders from P3 (138 units, now 4 periods ago - potentially lost), P4 (55 units, 3 periods ago), and P7 will place a new order. Given P3 is likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure of 296 is misleading. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable mean of ~76 and default lead time (L=2) since the only successful delivery met the promised lead time. I will use recent_N=4 for sigma to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Order from Period 3 (138 units) is likely lost; 4 periods have elapsed since order without arrival, similar to the confirmed loss of the Period 1 order.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0) and has suffered two significant lost orders: Period 1 (103 units) and Period 3 (138 units, now 5 periods since order). The only successful delivery (Period 2) arrived in exactly 2 periods. Currently, 296 units are in-transit (orders from P4 and P7). Demand has been volatile: after a February peak, it dipped in early March (~76 units) and spiked again in late March (130 units), likely due to Spring/Easter shopping. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 89.5 units. Because of the lost orders and current stockout, I must use 'explicit' parameters to ignore the lost pipeline inventory and force an order that covers the next (L+1) periods. I will set L=2 (promised and verified for the one arrival). For mu_hat, I will use (1+L) * 95 = 285 to account for the recent upward demand trend. For sigma_hat, I will assume a standard deviation of 30, resulting in sqrt(1+L) * 30 \u2248 52.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Order from Period 3 confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Significant demand volatility observed in March; demand rose to 130 in P7, suggesting a transition into a higher-demand Spring regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/08). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts due to high demand and lost orders. The orders from Period 1 (103 units) and Period 3 (138 units) are confirmed lost, as they have not arrived within 5+ periods. Only the Period 2 order arrived, with an actual lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. The in-transit inventory of 296 units consists of orders from Period 4 (55 units), and any internal adjustments. However, with the current stockout, we must re-establish a healthy inventory level to capture the Spring demand spike. Demand in the last two periods (P7, P8) averaged 121.5 units, significantly higher than the previous 3nd-6th period average (~76 units). Given the product (Jeggings) and the April date, we are in a high-demand Spring regime. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods of demand (N=2) to reflect the current regime, as the earlier lower demand is no longer representative. L will remain at the promised 'default' of 2 as the only successful shipment arrived on time.

Carry-over insight: Spring demand regime confirmed: Avg demand for P7-P8 is 121.5 units, a ~60% increase from the mid-March average.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. We are seeing a confirmed Spring demand regime for Jeggings. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P7-P9) is 116.7 units (130, 113, 107). There is an ongoing issue with lost or highly delayed shipments (P1 and P3 orders confirmed lost), while P2 arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 2. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 365 in-transit (orders from P4, P9, and previous undelivered). Since P4 (55 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived, it is almost certainly lost. This means effective pipeline inventory is likely only the 69 units ordered in P9. Given the high stockout risk and the 'Jeggings' product type peaking in Spring, I will use a 3-period 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current high-demand state (avg ~117), and set L to 'explicit' at 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed unreliability in lead times, even though the backend math uses (1+L). This helps ensure the base_stock calculation accounts for enough demand to cover the gap until the next reliable arrival.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 4 (55 units) is confirmed lost; 6 periods have elapsed with no arrival. This is the third lost shipment (P1, P3, P4).

As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the SKU (Ladies Denim Jeggings) is entering late April. We have significant delivery issues: orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost. However, the order from Period 9 arrived in just 1 period (observed at P10), indicating a potential shift to a shorter lead time (L=1). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 102 units in-transit (ordered P10). Demand for the last 4 periods (P7-P10) has been consistently elevated, averaging 109 units/period (130, 113, 107, 86) as we move into the spring season. Because the backend OR engine relies on L to calculate both the base stock and the order cap, setting L to an explicit value of 2 (conservative promise) while adjusting mu_hat to account for the Recent_N demand regime (last 4 periods = 109 avg) ensures we order enough to cover the high demand despite recent stockouts. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this spring regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability: While promised L=2, the Period 9 order arrived in 1 period; however, P1, P3, and P4 orders were lost entirely. Spring demand regime (P7-P10) established with an average of ~109 units/period.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late April (2019/4/29), identifying a 'Spring/Blue Denim' demand regime. Historical data from P7-P11 shows a stable higher-demand period with an average of 108 units following the initial season spike. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The supply chain is highly unreliable: orders from P1, P3, and P4 were lost (confirmed by ~6-period delays). Only P2 (L=2) and P9 (L=1) arrived successfully. With 398 units in-transit (orders from P10 and likely others recorded by the system), the inventory position is theoretically very high, but practically precarious due to lost shipments. The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will likely produce an order of 0 because it counts the 398 units in-transit as guaranteed arrivals. To ensure the backend protects against this, I am setting L=2 (promised) but providing an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent 5-period demand (P7-P11 average ~108). This ensures that if the system does decide to order, it targets the current demand level. The high 'In-transit' count is the primary bottleneck for new orders.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is Ladies Denim (Jeggings), which typically sees strong demand in Spring/early Summer. Recent demand (P12) spiked to 140, consistent with a high-demand regime. Analyzing the history: orders from P1, P3, and P4 were lost. The order from P10 (102 units) is now 2 periods old and should arrive in P13 (post-decision) if L=2, or P12 (already happened) if L=1. Since P12 conclude shows arrived=0, and P1-P4 showed high loss rates, I must assume a significant portion of the 'In-transit' quantity (398 units) is composed of these lost orders (103+138+55 = 296 units). Only about 102 units (from P10) are truly active in the pipeline for immediate arrival. To account for this in the OR backend (which doesn't subtract 'lost' units from pipeline), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand around 125 units/period based on the P7-P12 average (~114) and the P12 spike. With L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L) periods, so 3 * 125 = 375. However, since the OR engine sees 398 in-transit, it won't order if I set mu_hat to 375. I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that compensates for the lost inventory. I will set mu_hat to 600 to ensure the base stock (approx 600) minus pipeline (398) results in a meaningful replenishment order of approx 200 units to reach desired service levels for the May/June peak.

Carry-over insight: Inventory Pipeline Distortion: Physical 'In-transit' includes 296 units from likely lost orders (P1, P3, P4), leading to a persistent on-hand deficit. Demand regime is elevated (Spring peak) with P12 hitting 140 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 13, 2019. We are in the middle of a sustained high-demand Spring/Early-Summer regime for Jeggings. Recent demand (P11-P13) has averaged 113.6 units/period (104, 140, 97). The inventory pipeline is heavily distorted: out of 600 units 'In-transit', 296 units are effectively lost (P1, P3, P4 orders totaling 103, 138, 55 units respectively). The backend logic [base_stock - pipeline] will fail to order if it believes these 296 units are coming. Since the OR backend uses promised L=2, and we have one success at L=1 and one at L=2, I will set L to 'default' but use an 'explicit' mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline. Target base stock (3 periods) should be ~340 units (113.6 * 3). To force the backend to place an order when facing a 600-unit phantom pipeline, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that exceeds (pipeline + desired stock). However, the backend also caps the order at \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + safety. To bypass this and address the on-hand deficit caused by lost shipments, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the suspected losses while reflecting the current 113.6/period demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. The SKU is 'Ladies Jeggings,' which typically sees high demand during the spring and early summer seasons. Historically, we've observed a significant spring demand regime (P11-P14 avg \u2248 120 units). However, the system is suffering from massive inventory pipeline distortion. The 'In-transit' count is 600 units, but a large portion of this is comprised of confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4 totaling 296 units). Additionally, the order from Period 10 (102 units) has not arrived after 5 periods (expected L=2), suggesting it is also lost. The only recent order that might arrive is from Period 13 (202 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the *entire* 'In-transit' quantity (including lost units) from the target base stock, it calculates an order of zero, leaving the 'On-hand' at zero and resulting in lost sales. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'explicit' high values. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to exceed the phantom 600 in-transit units, triggering the OR engine to place a new order to cover the current spring demand (avg 120) across the look-ahead window (L+1 = 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 10 (102 units) confirmed lost; 5 periods elapsed with no arrival. Inventory pipeline inflation reached 398 units of confirmed lost stock (P1, P3, P4, P10).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (May 27, 2019), the system faces a critical inventory deficit. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 1100 units is severely distorted by historical losses. Based on the carry-over insights and arrival logs, orders from Periods 1 (103), 3 (138), 4 (55), and 10 (102) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 398 'ghost' units. Additionally, the order from Period 13 (202 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it might also be delayed or lost. However, we have a massive order of 500 units from Period 15 in the pipeline. Demand is in a high-sustained Spring regime (avg ~112 units/period over P11-P15). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive (but largely fake) pipeline, I will set 'L' to an explicit higher value (3) and 'mu_hat' to an explicit high value. This 'tricks' the backend into recognizing a larger requirement for the (L+1) window, compensating for the lost stock that the OR engine still thinks is coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Order from Period 13 (202 units) is 3 periods old with no arrival, adding to the pattern of lost/highly delayed shipments. Spring demand regime remains strong, averaging 121 units over the last 5 periods (P11-P15).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the actual pipeline is severely distorted by lost orders. The orders from P1 (103), P3 (138), P4 (55), P10 (102), and now potentially P13 (202) are lost or significantly delayed, totaling 600 units of 'phantom' inventory in-transit. Currently, the system shows 1100 units in-transit, but only 500 (from P15) and potentially 202 (from P13) or future orders are likely to arrive. We are in a high-demand Spring/Early Summer regime (average demand ~120 units/period). To compensate for the 600 lost units and the backend's inability to recognize these as lost, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to inflate the base stock level. This forces the OR backend to place an order despite the high 'in-transit' count. I estimate the required base stock for L+1 (3 periods) at ~360 units. By setting mu_hat to 960 (360 base + 600 lost), I counteract the phantom inventory. I set L to 3 to reflect the consistent delivery delays and losses observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Order from Period 13 (202 units) is likely lost/severely delayed (4 periods elapsed). Total estimated phantom/lost inventory in-transit is now 600 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Current demand regime maintains an average of ~114 units (P11-P16).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18 (2019/06/10), the system reports an on-hand inventory of 388 units (following a 500-unit arrival in P17 from the P15 order). The 'In-transit' figure of 600 units exactly matches the sum of orders from P1 (103), P3 (138), P4 (55), P10 (102), and P13 (202), all of which are \u2265 5 periods old and highly likely lost based on historical patterns. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (including these 600 'phantom' units) from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless parameters are adjusted. Demand has remained consistently elevated in the Spring/early Summer regime, averaging ~114 units over the last 7 periods (P11-P17). To circumvent the pipeline distortion and ensure the OR engine maintains stock, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) as ~342 units (3 * 114). To trigger an order despite the 600-unit phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this offset. However, current on-hand (388) is sufficient for ~3.4 periods of demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current regime and use L=2, allowing the on-hand to deplete slightly before the next order is triggered, while acknowledging that the lost units in the pipeline are preventing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Phantom in-transit inventory reached 600 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). All are \u2265 5 periods old and confirmed lost. This distortion prevents the OR backend from placing new orders as it assumes a massive incoming supply.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223035' (Ladies Jeggings) is currently in a steady Summer/Spring demand regime with an average demand of approximately 114 units over the last 8 periods (P11-P18). The current period (P19) begins with 274 units on-hand. A critical issue exists with 'In-transit' inventory: 600 units (from orders in P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13) are effectively lost, as they are all at least 5 periods old with no arrival confirmation. The OR engine (capped base stock) uses Pipeline Inventory (On-hand + In-transit) to determine the order size. With 274 on-hand and 600 'phantom' in-transit units, the engine's pipeline is perceived as 874 units. Because this drastically exceeds the base stock calculation, no new orders are being placed. To force the backend to place an order, I am increasing 'L' to 'explicit: 8'. This expands the risk window the OR engine covers (mu_hat calculation becomes (1+8)*daily_mean), raising the base stock level high enough to potentially exceed the 874 pipeline units and trigger a replenishment order. Demand is modeled using 'recent_N: 8' to capture the current stable 114 units/period regime.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss continues: 600 units in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) are confirmed lost after 5+ periods. No new arrivals have corrected the pipeline inflation as of P19.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), we continue to battle significant pipeline inflation. Out of the 744 units 'In-transit', 600 units are definitively lost (Orders P1: 103, P3: 138, P4: 55, P10: 102, P13: 202), all being \u2265 7 periods old except P13 (now 7 periods old). These lost units total 600 precisely. The backend formula 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory' sees 744 in-transit and blocks ordering. To force an order and maintain stock for the upcoming weeks, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these 600 'phantom' units. The current demand regime (P14-P19) averages 113.3 units/period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the expected mu_hat should be ~340 (113.3 * 3). Adding the 600 phantom units to this target gives 940. This 'explicit' mu_hat will bypass the OR engine's suppression. Period 19 demand was 87, showing a slight cooling, but the priority is clearing the order block caused by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Pipeline distortion persists with 600 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) confirmed lost. Order from P15 (500 units) arrived correctly (L=2) in P17, but P13 is now 7 periods overdue, confirmed lost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a period of pipeline distortion where 600 units from orders placed in P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 are confirmed lost (all are 7+ periods overdue). The OR backend includes these 'phantom' units in the pipeline inventory subtractor, preventing necessary replacement orders. To force the OR backend to order, I must set the lead time (L) and demand forecast (mu_hat) high enough to overcome this 600-unit deficit plus current on-hand stock (133). Current demand has softened slightly in late June (P19-P20 avg: 70.5), but the overall Spring season average (P11-P20) is 107.5. I am choosing 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1100 to target a base stock high enough (approx 1100) to exceed total pipeline + on-hand (753 + 133 = 886), triggering an order of roughly 200 units to maintain service levels as on-hand depleted. L is set to 'default' as recent successful deliveries (P15) arrived within the promised 2 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '399223035' continues to suffer from extreme pipeline distortion. The 'In-transit' count of 967 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P1 (103), P3 (138), P4 (55), P10 (102), and P13 (202), totaling 600 'phantom' units. Additionally, recent orders from P19 (144) and P20 (9) have not yet arrived (expected L=2). Since L is promised at 2 but varies, and phantom stock prevents the OR engine from ordering enough to meet the current demand regime (~85 units/week in the last 3 weeks), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the pipeline logic. By setting mu_hat high enough to cover (L+1) periods of demand while the backend subtracts the 967 in-transit units, I aim to force an order. However, given the profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the backend target is z=0 (50% service level). To ensure the backend places an order despite the 967 units of in-transit, mu_hat must be set to a value where mu_hat - pipeline > 0. Since the goal is to maintain stock for a regime of ~90 units/period, I will set mu_hat explicitly high to trigger replenishment, keeping L at the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Pipeline distortion confirmed at 600 units of lost stock (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). On-hand is depleted to 57 units. Demand has cooled from Spring peaks to a Summer average of ~72 units (P19-P21).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a 100% stockout (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' count of 1034 is highly deceptive due to a documented sequence of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13 total 600 units). Additionally, the P19 order (144 units) is now 3 periods overdue, likely lost. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend's default logic from ordering enough to meet demand because it believes supply is coming. To bypass this, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat to force a higher base stock. Demand has stabilized into a 'Summer' regime: the average of the last 4 periods (P19-P22) is 75.25. With L=2, the total lead-time demand (L+1) is approximately 226 units. Setting mu_hat to 600 and sigma_hat to 150 ensures the base stock (mu + sigma) significantly exceeds the ~800 units of lost stock ('In-transit') that the backend subtracts, thereby triggering a new replenishment order. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of the successful deliveries (P2, P9, P15, P20).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Order from P19 (144 units) is likely lost (3 periods elapsed with no arrival). Total confirmed/likely lost inventory in-transit is now 744 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Summer demand regime is steady at ~75 units/period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status: 201 units on-hand. The physical 'In-transit' count of 810 is highly distorted by historical lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P1 (103), P3 (138), P4 (55), P10 (102), P13 (202), and now potentially P19 (144) appear lost as they have exceeded promised lead times significantly (P19 is now 4 periods old). Total confirmed/likely lost units = 744. The real functional pipeline is the order from P23 (66 units). Total functional inventory = 201 (on-hand) + 66 (P23 in-transit) = 267 units. Demand has shifted from a Spring peak (~120) to a Summer regime. The last 4 periods (P20-P23) show an average demand of 75.75 units. At this rate, 267 units cover approximately 3.5 periods of demand. With an actual lead time moving between 1 and 2 periods, the current stock levels are sufficient. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 75-80 unit Summer demand trend and use calculate for L to leverage observed arrival data (recent arrivals show L=1 or L=2). This allows the OR backend to maintain a buffer without over-ordering into the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime confirmed (P20-P23): average ~76 units. Order from P19 (144 units) is now 4 periods old without arrival and is categorized as lost, bringing total estimated phantom inventory to 744 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/7/29), the SKU is in a summer demand regime with a cooling trend. The average demand for the last five periods (P20-P24) is 68.2 units, with P24 showing a significant drop to 38 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 810 units is severely distorted by phantom inventory: 744 units are confirmed lost based on historical gaps (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19 are all \u22655 periods old). The OR backend assumes this 744 units will arrive, preventing necessary replenishment. To correct for this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a target that bypasses the internal pipeline math. Given the summer average is ~68-75 units and a (L+1) horizon (where L=2), the target pipeline should be ~225 units. Currently, on-hand is 163 and true in-transit (P23 order) is 66 units, totaling 229, which is sufficient. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat base to capture the latest cooling (avg ~70) while setting L to the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P20, P21, P22) have returned to a 1-2 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand cooling: P20-P24 average dropped to 68 units/period, down from Spring average of ~114. Pipeline distortion remains at 744 units of lost stock (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (Period 26). The product is 'Jeggings', which typically sees stable or slightly declining demand in late summer before a potential back-to-school rise. Recent demand (P20-P25) has averaged ~66 units/period, down from the Spring average of ~114. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19 are statistically confirmed lost (all are 7+ periods old, whereas successful lead times are 1-2 periods). This total lost volume is 744 units. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (810) from the target base stock, effectively preventing new orders even as on-hand stock (110) depletes. To force the OR backend to order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 744 units of phantom inventory. Strategy: 1) Account for real demand: ~66 units/week. 2) Compensate for distortion: I need the target base stock (calculated as mu_hat + safety stock) to exceed the total pipeline of 810. For a (1+L) review period where L=2, mu_hat should logically be 3 * 66 = 198. To bypass the 744 phantom units and target a healthy on-hand level, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired inventory position (~250 units) and the phantom volume (744) = ~994. This ensures the OR logic [max(0, base_stock - in_transit)] generates an order of approximately 180-200 units to cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic shipment loss: 744 units in-transit (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) are permanently lost. Summer demand regime established at ~66 units per period (P20-P25).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/12. We are in a summer demand regime with significantly lower demand compared to the spring peak. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is approximately 65.6 units. The product (Jeggings) is a staple item, so demand is expected to remain relatively stable until fall transitions. Regarding logistics, the pipeline is heavily distorted by 744 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). These units will likely never arrive, but the OR backend counts them toward the 'base_stock', preventing necessary new orders. To bypass this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat set significantly higher than actual projected demand. By setting mu_hat = (Actual Forecast * (1+L)) + Estimated Lost Stock, I force the OR backend to place orders that counteract the phantom inventory. I estimate current demand at 65 units/period. For L=2, required stock is 65 * 3 = 195. Adding the 744 lost units gives an explicit mu_hat of 939. Sigma_hat is set to 25 (covering a std dev of ~14 per period over 3 periods) to ensure a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Lead time for P23 order was 3 periods, confirming continued variability (L range 1-3). Explicit parameter overrides continue to be used to mitigate the 744-unit phantom inventory distortion.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the product exhibits a stabilized Summer demand regime with an average of approximately 64 units per period across P20-P27. The most critical issue remains the massive pipeline distortion: there are 744 units of known lost inventory (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19) that the OR backend incorrectly counts as 'In-transit'. This 744-unit phantom stock prevents the automated logic from ordering, despite On-hand inventory dropping to 43. My strategy uses explicit overrides to 're-map' the OR engine's view. By setting mu_hat = (actual_pipeline - phantom_stock) + desired_coverage, I force the engine to recognize the deficit. Current Pipeline (In-transit) is 818. Phantom is 744. Real In-transit = 74. On-hand = 43. Total real position = 117. Expected demand for the lead time (L=2) plus review period is roughly 3 periods * 64 units = 192 units. To bridge the 75-unit gap (192 - 117), I must set mu_hat to inflate the base stock relative to the perceived (but fake) 818-unit supply.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand regime (P20-P27) stabilized at ~64 units/period. Lead time for P23 confirmed at 3 periods, while most recent arrivals (P22) were 1 period, maintaining an average L near 2.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the product (Ladies Jeggings) is in a stable late-summer demand regime. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P20-P28) is ~65 units. However, there is a severe inventory pipeline distortion. The system shows 957 units 'In-transit', but history confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and now P19 (totaling 888 units) are lost or permanently delayed (all are \u2265 6 periods old, well beyond the promised L=2 and observed max L=3). Only the order from P26 (74 units) and P28 (139 units) are genuinely expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To trigger an order from the OR backend which sees 957 units in-transit, I must set mu_hat extremely high to overcome this phantom pipeline and provide enough stock for the next few weeks. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 65 + 888 units to bypass the distortion, effectively targeting a base stock that ignores the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 888 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) is confirmed. Summer demand is stable at ~65 units/period.

The system current date is 2019/9/2 (Period 30). The SKU 399223035 is in a stable late-summer demand regime. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P20-P29) shows an average demand of approximately 61.3 units, significantly lower than the Spring peak. A critical issue remains: the 'In-transit' figure of 1083 units is severely inflated by multiple confirmed/likely lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and possibly P28 if delayed, though P28 is only 2 periods old). Based on carry-over insights, at least 888 units are permanently lost. To bypass this pipeline distortion and force the OR engine to place necessary orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1=3) period window as 3 * 61.3 = 184 units. To offset the ~888 phantom units in the backend's pipeline calculation (Order = Base stock - Pipeline), I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1072 (184 target + 888 offset). This ensures the backend recognizes a need for stock despite the fake pipeline. L is kept at 'default' (2) as recent successful deliveries (P21, P22) arrived in 1-2 periods, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 888 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) confirmed. Summer demand regime (P20-P29) stabilized at ~61 units/period.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09 (Period 31), moving into early autumn. Demand for the last 10 periods (P21-P30) has averaged 61.2 units, indicating a stable summer/early autumn regime compared to the higher spring average (~114). The pipeline remains significantly distorted by 'phantom' in-transit inventory. Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19 (totaling 888 units) are confirmed lost as they are all 6+ periods overdue. The current 'In-transit' shown by the system is 944 units, which includes these 888 lost units plus a valid order from P29 (126 units) and likely the P26 order (74 units) which is now 5 periods old and likely lost as well. To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which subtracts the 944 units of in-transit inventory from the target base stock\u2014I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand and adds back the 888 units of lost stock. Using L=2, (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Mean demand (61) * 3 = 183 units. Adding back the 888 lost units: 183 + 888 = 1071. This ensures the engine sees enough 'demand' to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory. I use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from severe pipeline inflation due to 888 units of confirmed lost inventory (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). With on-hand inventory at 20 units and 'In-transit' at 985 units, the OR backend sees 1005 units available, far exceeding any reasonable base stock for the current demand level. This prevents the backend from placing necessary orders. Demand has stabilized into a late-summer/early-autumn regime, with an average of 59.5 units over the last 6 periods (P26-P31). To force an order and maintain service levels, I provide an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the 888 units of lost stock. Required base stock is (1+L)*demand + safety stock, which for L=2 and demand=60 is ~180 + safety. To counteract the -888 unit distortion, mu_hat is set to approximately 1070 (888 + 182) to prompt the OR engine to reconcile the gap. L is set to explicit 2 based on the most recent successful arrival (P28 order arrived in P30).

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total confirmed lost inventory remains at 888 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Current demand regime (Late Summer/Early Autumn) is stable at ~60 units/period (P26-P31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand for this SKU has stabilized in a late summer/early autumn regime, averaging approximately 60.5 units over the last 10 periods (P23-P32). The primary challenge remains the systemic 'In-transit' inventory distortion. There are 888 units across multiple historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) that are confirmed lost as they are far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods and the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. In-transit currently shows 1,009 units, meaning only 121 units (from P29 and P32) are likely valid. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1,009 units from the base stock calculation, it will fail to order enough to meet demand. To counteract this 'phantom inventory', I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand plus the 888 units of lost stock, effectively forcing the backend to ignore the lost units. With L=2 and mean demand ~61, (3 * 61) + 888 = 1071. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed late summer/early autumn demand regime (P23-P32) with a mean of ~61 units/period. The total phantom inventory from lost shipments is 888 units, necessitating explicit parameter padding to maintain appropriate on-hand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant pipeline distortion. We have 1071 units in-transit, but 888 of these are from historical periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) and are confirmed lost as they are far past the promised lead time of 2. The true active pipeline consists of orders from P29 (126), P32 (65), and P33 (62), totaling 253 units. The backend OR engine sees the full 1071 units and will refuse to order unless we adjust parameters significantly. The current demand regime (Autumn) shows a mean of approximately 64 units over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), but P33 saw a spike to 97 units. To trigger a necessary order and offset the 888 units of phantom stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods * 70 units/period = 210) plus the 888 units of phantom stock that the backend will subtract from the order, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1098. This ensures the backend places an order to maintain on-hand levels despite the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss totaling 888 units confirmed (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Current demand regime (Late Sep) shows volatility with P33 spike to 97, though the 10-period average is ~64.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. We are in the early autumn season. Demand has been relatively stable around 64 units/period over the last 10 periods, despite a brief spike in P33. The most critical issue is the massive pipeline distortion: 'In-transit' shows 1098 units, but historical evidence confirms that 888 units (from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) are lost. These lost units represent 'phantom' inventory that prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus a buffer, accounting for the 888-unit distortion. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (Avg Demand 64 * (2+1) periods) + (Safety Stock ~30) = ~222 units. Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - in_transit, I set mu_hat such that 'base_stock' compensates for the 888 lost units. Target base_stock should be ~1110 (888 phantom + 222 real). Set mu_hat = 1110 / (L+1) = 1110 / 3 = 370. This ensures the backend sees a need for fresh stock despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods based on recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic shipment loss of 888 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) continues to distort pipeline inventory. Actual average demand for the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is 64.1 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/10/14. On-hand inventory is 20 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1033 units is heavily distorted by 888 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Additionally, the orders from P33 (62 units) and P34 (27 units) are currently 3 and 2 periods old respectively; while 2-3 periods is within the observed delivery range, the systematic history of losses warrants caution. Demand has settled into an Autumn regime with a 10-period average of 64.1 units. To bypass the backend's capped policy\u2014which sees 1033 units in-transit and 20 on-hand, assuming a massive surplus\u2014I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat=1000 (a value high enough to force an order despite the 1033 phantom units), and sigma_hat=100. This is designed to ensure the system places an order to replenish the physical on-hand deficit, compensating for the inventory the OR engine incorrectly thinks is arriving.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Oct 21, 2019. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is slightly lower, averaging 59 units/period, down from the early autumn spike. However, a major issue persists: a systemic shipment loss of 888 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) is artificially inflating the 'In-transit' count to 971, whereas logical in-transit is only 83 units (P29, P34). This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering new stock. Last period (P36), the P33 order arrived with L=3. To force the OR backend to order despite the 888 units of lost stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock (Order-up-to level) for a 3-period window (L+1=3) at ~63 units/period plus a safety buffer, and then add the 888 lost units: (63 * 3) + (1.64 * 15 * sqrt(3)) + 888 \u2248 1120. This allows the OR backend to place an order that covers real demand while accounting for the inaccessible phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: P36: Order from P33 arrived with L=3. Recent lead times show variability between 1-3 periods. Strategic use of explicit parameters is required to offset the 888 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) which remain in-transit indefinitely.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1079 units. However, based on the historical pattern of lost shipments (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19 are confirmed or highly likely lost), 888 units of this pipeline are 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The remaining 191 units in-transit consist of orders from P29 (126 units), P34 (27 units), and P37 (108 units - just placed). Order P29 is now 9 periods old with no arrival, making it 100% likely lost as well (increasing phantom total to 1014). The OR backend's formula 'order = base_stock - pipeline' would result in no orders being placed due to this inflated pipeline. To correct for the 1014 units of phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate demand at ~55 units/period (average of recent 5 periods P33-P37). For a target coverage of 3 periods (L+1), desired stock is ~165. To force the OR backend to place an order despite seeing 1079 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1244 (165 + 1079). This ensures the inventory deficit is bypassed. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability (1-3 periods) observed in late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Order from P29 (126 units) confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed); total phantom inventory increased to 1014 units. Recent demand (P33-P37) has cooled to an average of 57 units/period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 39 (Nov 4), the system faces massive inventory pipeline distortion. There are 1,136 units 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation confirms that 1,014 of these are lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and now P29, which is 10 periods old). The only technically active shipment is the 165 units ordered in P38. With On-hand at 30 units and a current demand regime averaging ~61 units per period (P33-P38 mean: 60.8), the backend will refuse to order because it believes the pipeline is full. To fix this, I utilize 'explicit' parameters. I set L=2 (promised). Demand is set using an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (1+L) * Forecasted_Mean + Phantom_Inventory. Forecasted Mean ~61 * 3 = 183. Phantom Inventory is 1,014. Total mu_hat = 1,197. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the phantom 1,014 units and focus on the real requirement of covering 3 periods of demand (~183 units). Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for recent volatility (demand jumped to 78 in P38) and lead time variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed lost inventory reaches 1,014 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29). Actual demand for the last 6 periods (P33-P38) averages 60.8 units, reflecting a stable late Autumn regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to suffer from extreme pipeline distortion due to systemic shipment losses. In-transit inventory is currently 1167 units, but analysis of history confirms that 1014 of these units (from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and P29) are permanently lost (each is at least 9 periods overdue). Without intervention, the OR backend assumes it has massive incoming supply and won't order, leading to the current stockout (on-hand = 0). Demand is stable in a late Autumn regime, averaging 60.8 units over the last 6 periods. To force an order that covers the inventory gap, I am using the 'explicit' method with 'mu_hat' set to 1200. This value exceeds the phantom inventory (1167) plus a buffer for the expected demand over the lead time (approximately 60 units/period * 3 periods = 180). L is set to explicit 2 (the promised value) to balance the order calculation, and sigma is set to a standard volatility for this demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed late Autumn demand stable at ~61 units/period (P33-P39). Total systemic shipment loss remains at 1014 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29), causing persistent pipeline distortion.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the system faces a massive pipeline distortion. Total 'In-transit' is 1200 units, but historical evidence confirms that 1,014 of these units are permanently lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and now P29, which is 12 periods overdue). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts this 1200-unit pipeline from the base stock, effectively zeroing out any new orders. To force an order and maintain stock for the current late-Autumn demand regime (~60 units/period), I must use the 'explicit' method to override the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters. I set mu_hat to 1,200 to neutralize the phantom inventory (1,014 lost units + estimated demand for L+1 periods) and sigma_hat to a value that provides a sufficient buffer without over-ordering. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger a purchase despite the fake pipeline. Demand is stable at ~55-65 units per week.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative confirmed lost inventory remains at 1,014 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29). Demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is stable with an average of 54.6 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, we are in late November. The demand remains in a stable Autumn regime with an average of approximately 53 units over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). A critical systemic issue persists: the inventory pipeline is significantly inflated by 1,014 units from orders that are long overdue and confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' to calculate the final order, these 1,014 units prevent the system from placing any new orders, leading to stockouts as seen in P39-P41. To counteract this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock needed for a lead time of 2 (L+1 = 3 periods of demand). With a mean demand of ~55 and a high service level requirement, a base stock of 1200 units is set (1014 to offset lost units + ~180 for 3 periods of demand). This 'pads' the mu_hat to ensure the backend allows new orders to be placed despite the phantom in-transit stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current volatility of the stable regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/2 (Period 43). We are in a winter demand regime. The last 5 periods (P38-P42) show an average demand of 61.4 units, although P42 spiked to 90. The systemic shipment loss (phantom inventory) remains the critical challenge. In-transit currently shows 1200 units, but 1014 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29). These lost units are older than 5 periods and will never arrive, yet the OR backend's capped policy counts them towards base stock. At P43, we have 0 units on-hand and 186 units actually in-transit (P40, P42). To force the backend to place an order despite the 1014-unit phantom inflation, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate for (L+1) = 3 periods, we need ~185 units of coverage (approx 62/period). To neutralize the 1014 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to approximately demand*(L+1) + lost_units. Therefore, mu_hat = 185 + 1014 = 1199. I will round this to 1200. I'll use standard L=2 and recent_N for sigma_hat to handle volatility like the recent P42 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing a systemic distortion where 1,014 units of inventory are 'In-transit' but long-confirmed as lost (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock, it would normally fail to order anything. To fix this, I utilize the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to forcibly inject a demand forecast that compensates for the phantom inventory. Current demand is in a stable late Autumn/Early Winter regime; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 49.6 units, but with a recent spike to 90 (P42). I will assume a base demand of ~60 units per period. For L=2, the total required stock is (L+1)*60 = 180 units. To trigger an order given 1,167 in-transit (1,014 lost + others) and 14 on-hand, I set mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory (base_stock) must exceed pipeline_inventory to generate an order. I am setting mu_hat to 1400 to ensure the backend covers the phantom inventory and targets a realistic on-hand buffer for upcoming periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative confirmed lost inventory remains at 1,014 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29). Demand volatility observed in Dec: P42=90 units followed by P43=19 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Mid-December (Period 45). Demand has shown significant end-of-year volatility (P42=90, P43=19, P44=26). The inventory pipeline remains severely distorted by 1,014 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29). These units will never arrive but the OR backend counts them as 'in-transit', preventing new orders. To maintain service levels, I must use 'explicit' parameter overrides. The 5-period average demand is approximately 43 units. Setting mu_hat to 135 (approx 3 periods of demand) ensures the OR backend calculates a total requirement that exceeds the 1,014-unit phantom inventory 'pipeline', forcing an actual physical order. Lead time remains variable but averages 2. Holding cost and profit are balanced at $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Significant demand volatility in Dec (90 units in P42 vs 20s in P43-44). Total confirmed lost inventory (phantom in-transit) remains at 1,014 units, requiring explicit overrides until the end of the simulation.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 (Dec 23, 2019). The 1,014 units of documented phantom inventory (lost shipments P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29) continue to block the OR backend from ordering by inflated pipeline stock. The demand regime in December has been volatile, with a recent spike to 89 units in P45 following a lull. To counteract the 1,014-unit distortion and ensure stock is actually ordered, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the base stock needed for a lead time of 2 (target inventory for 3 periods: current + L) at approximately 240 units (avg 80 * 3). Adding the 1,014 phantom units gives an explicit mu_hat of 1254. For L, I use recent_N=5 to capture current logistics variability (last arrivals were L=2, 3, 3, 3, 3). For sigma_hat, explicit volatility is set to 40 to account for recent December demand swings.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter the final period (P47, the end of the simulation), the objective is to satisfy any remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 1355 units listed as in-transit. However, based on the carry-over history, 1014 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P29). Recent arrivals (P40, P42) showed a lead time of 3 periods. The order from P44 (219 units) is in its 3rd period and might arrive during P47. December demand has been volatile, with a surge in P45 (89) and P46 (72). Even if the P44 order arrives, it will likely cover the final period's demand. Given this is the final decision for the simulation, no further ordering is required to maximize the reward function (Profit - Holding Cost), as any new order would arrive after the game ends. I will use explicit parameters to prevent the OR backend from attempting to 'top up' against the phantom in-transit stock or potential stockouts for a period that doesn't exist.
