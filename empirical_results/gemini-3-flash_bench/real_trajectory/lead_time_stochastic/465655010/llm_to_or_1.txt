Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p', a lingerie item. Historical demand from the early weeks of 2019 shows significant volatility (samples: 175, 46, 37, 127, 216). Average weekly demand is 120.2 units. Given we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. The promised lead time is 2 periods. No lead time data is available yet, so I will use the default for L. For demand forecasting, the average of all 5 available samples (120.2) is the best starting point. Therefore, mu_hat should be set to (1+L) * 120.2 = 360.6. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of historical samples (~78.5) times sqrt(1+L), which is approximately 135.9. I will use the 'explicit' method to ensure the OR engine starts with these calculated priors correctly to avoid under-stocking in the first period.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Historical weekly demand samples are: 175, 46, 37, 127, 216. Period 1 demand was 41. The mean of all 6 samples is approximately 107. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (making the safety factor z=0), implying we should aim for the median demand. However, current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived yet (promised lead time L=2). The order of 250 units placed in Period 1 is 'In-transit' and expected to arrive in Period 3's arrival phase (visible in Period 4 decision). To avoid further stockouts, I will set L to the promised 2, and mu_hat based on the average of all available samples (including P1). Given the high variance in the samples (37 to 216), I will use the default sigma calculation to ensure the OR backend accounts for this volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's lingerie item (Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p). The current state is critical: we have 0 units on-hand and have suffered from stockouts in Periods 1 and 2, resulting in 0 sales despite a demand of 41 and 20 units respectively. The total in-transit quantity is 321 units (250 from P1, 71 from P2). Promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the 'Critical Timing Example', the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P4's start). Historical samples (Jan-Feb) show highly volatile demand: 175, 46, 37, 127, 216. The average demand of available samples (including recent under-stock periods) is roughly 96 units/week. Given the stockout history, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the higher pre-game volume while acknowledging the lower recent demand. For L, I will use 'default' (2) as we are still within the promised window for the first order.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product is women's cotton lace thongs. Observed demand over the last 8 weeks (including pre-game samples) has fluctuated: 175, 46, 37, 127, 216 (pre-game) and 41, 20, 6 (game periods). This suggests a cooling trend after a February peak (likely Valentine's Day seasonality). On-hand inventory is 0, with 321 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (250 units) should have arrived during P3 and been visible in the P3 conclude message, but it shows arrived=0. This indicates a delay or a lead time of at least 3 periods. I will set L to 3 explicitly to account for this delay and ensure the OR logic covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower demand trend (avg ~60) compared to the earlier spikes, preventing over-ordering while stock is stuck in transit. Sigma_hat remains default to capture the high historical volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a women's lingerie item (thong briefs). Historical demand shows significant volatility: 175, 46, 37, 127, 216 (pre-game) and 41, 20, 6, 147 (in-game). Period 4 saw a sharp spike to 147 units, depleting all 71 units that arrived. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. We have 257 units in-transit (250 from P1 and 7 from P4). The P1 order of 250 units is now 2 periods past its promised lead time (P1 order should have arrived in P3), suggesting it may be delayed or lost. However, the P2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2 in P4). Given the stockout and the high demand in P4 (147), we need to ensure the OR backend targets a higher base stock to recover. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the recent demand surge while acknowledging the low values in P2-P3. Sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=4) to reflect this high variance. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time of 2, while remaining cautious about the 'missing' P1 shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '465655010' (Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p) is facing a stockout. Period 4 demand (147) and Period 5 demand (190) spiked significantly compared to the early February average (~30), likely due to a seasonal shift or promotion. Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4). The P1 order of 250 units is currently overdue (placed P1, expected P3, now P6). However, 'In-transit' shows 257 units, which accounts for the P1 order (250) and P4 order (7). Since it hasn't concluded as 'lost', I will assume it's delayed. For parameters: L=2 (promised/observed). For mu_hat, the recent demand (P4/P5) suggests a new regime. I'll use N=2 to capture the high recent volume (~168 avg) across (1+L)=3 periods, totaling 504. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=5 to incorporate the high volatility seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting March: Avg demand increased from ~30 to ~168 (Periods 4-5). Possible delay in P1 shipment (ordered P1, not arrived by P6).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25th, and we are experiencing a significant demand regime shift. Historical data before February showed demand under 50, but since early March, demand has stabilized between 147 and 190. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is approximately 172. Inventory management is currently critical as we are stock-out (on-hand = 0) despite high demand. Shipment tracking: P1 order (250 units) is now 4 periods late (it should have arrived in P3 or P4 based on the promised 2-period lead time), suggesting it is likely lost. The P2 order arrived on time in P4. We have 506 units in-transit (P1: 250, P4: 7, P6: 249). However, if P1 is lost, we actually only have ~256 reliable units in-transit. I will set L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the new demand level (approx 172 * (1+2) = 516). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: P1 shipment (250 units) confirmed lost: ordered P1, expected P3/P4, still not arrived by P7. Adjusted planning to ignore these units in pipeline logic.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). The SKU is a women's lingerie item (Ginger Thong Maple). Historical demand analysis shows a significant regime shift: Periods 1-3 averaged ~22 units, but since Period 4 (early March), demand has surged to an average of ~143 (147, 190, 178, 59), likely due to seasonal spring fashion trends or promotions. The drop to 59 in Period 7 might be an outlier or a temporary dip, but the mean of the last 4 periods is substantially higher than the initial weeks. Inventory status is critical: On-hand is 0. The 250 units ordered in P1 are confirmed lost (Carry-over insight). This leaves genuine in-transit units from P4 (7 units), P6 (249 units), and P7 (9 units) totaling 265 units (the backend 'In-transit' of 515 still counts the lost 250). Lead time for the only successful delivery (P2 order) was exactly the promised 2 periods. To stabilize, I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher March demand regime, and L to default (2). I choose explicit for mu_hat to ensure it covers the (1+L)=3 periods of high demand (~143 * 3 = 429). Since there is a large pipeline of 265 actual units, the OR engine will place a smaller replenishment order to reach the target.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/04/08). Reviewing the history: demand shifted significantly in March (P4-P7) with an average of 143.5 units/week, but plummeted to 17 in P8. This volatility is characteristic of product launches or 'Ginger Thong' promotions in the womens lingerie category. The Period 1 order (250 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 8 periods since ordering. Current on-hand is 241, and in-transit is 257 (likely the lost P1 units + P9 order if placed). However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 257 suggests the P1 order (250) + P4 order (7) is what the system thinks is in transit. Since P4 was small and P1 is lost, we effectively have 241 units against a recent demand that spiked and then crashed. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the average reflecting both the high-demand March period and the recent drop, ensuring we don't overreact to the P8 outlier while still acknowledging the regime shift from the start of the year.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: March peaks averaged ~144 units, followed by a sharp drop to 17 units in early April. Maintaining cautious forecast to balance stockouts and high holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 10 (2019/04/15). The current inventory state for SKU 465655010 is 190 units on-hand with 250 units from Period 1 still incorrectly listed as 'in-transit' (confirmed lost in Period 7) and 7 units from Period 4 (possibly lost or delayed). Demand history shows a high-volatility regime: early Year (avg ~80), a March peak (avg ~150+), and a recent April drop (Periods 8-9 avg: 34). The product is 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p', a staple lingerie item. The profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 0.5). To avoid overstocking during this low-demand phase while accounting for historical volatility, I will use a 3-period trailing average (N=3) for mu_hat (including the current period) to capture the recent deceleration (averaging approx 42 units/week). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to incorporate the volatility transition from the March peak to the April trough, ensuring a buffer against sudden spikes without excessive holding costs. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as observed lead times have varied between 1 and 2 periods.

LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/4/22), the SKU (women's lingerie) shows highly volatile demand. After a low point in early April, demand spiked back to 134 units in Period 10. The historical data (samples + game history) shows distinct regimes: Jan-Feb (low-mid), March (high peak ~170), early April (low ~34), and mid-late April (rising). The average of the last 4 periods (P7-P10) is 65.25. Given the recent spike to 134, a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering the April transition) is appropriate to capture the current trend without overreacting to the single low of 17. The Period 1 shipment (250 units) remains lost and is correctly excluded from pipeline logic by the OR engine once it stops appearing in 'In-transit', though currently, 'In-transit' shows 257 (likely the lost 250 + Period 4's 7 units, as P6 and P7 orders already arrived). I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters to prioritize recent April behaviors.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 29. Historically, demand for this SKU showed a significant spike in March (averaging ~160-180), followed by a cooling period in April (averaging ~60). However, the most recent period (P11) saw demand of 37, and the average over the last four periods (P8-P11) is approx 60. On-hand inventory is low (19), but there are 257 units in-transit (part of which is the lost 250 units from P1). The 'In-transit' figure likely still reflects that lost P1 shipment, but since it has been 11 periods, we must treat it as null. Observed lead times for arrived orders were 2 and 1 periods. To prepare for May, I will use a recent demand window to capture the post-March slowdown while maintaining enough stock to cover the 2-period lead time. I'll use N=5 for demand to balance the March spike and April trough.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are looking at the 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p' (Womens Underwear). Current on-hand inventory is critically low (3 units). In-transit inventory stands at 257 units, but this includes the 250 units ordered in Period 1 that were previously identified as 'lost' in Period 7. Since they have been missing for 12 periods (promised lead time is 2), they should be excluded from pipeline logic. Period 12 demand was low (16), but demand in this category tends to be volatile (ranging from ~17 to ~190). The recent 5 periods (P8-P12) show an average demand of approximately 51 units. With a holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand (z=0) to minimize stockout and holding costs equally. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and variance to capture the post-March peak stabilization while maintaining readiness for mid-range demand.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655010 (Ginger Thong) is currently at zero on-hand inventory as of the end of Period 13, following a stockout where 82 units of demand were lost. We are entering mid-May. Historical demand analysis shows significant volatility: early March saw a spike (approx. 172 units/week), April saw a sharp decline (approx. 35 units/week), and Period 13 saw a rebound to 85 units. The lost shipment from Period 1 (250 units) is permanently removed from planning considerations. The current 'In-transit' of 257 units appears to be the original lost P1 shipment (250) + a small trickle; effectively, the pipeline is empty of usable stock. Lead times have been mostly 2 periods (P2 arrived P4, P6 arrived P8), with one instance of 1 period (P7 arrived P8). For Period 14, I will set L to 'calculate' (avg of 2, 2, 1). To address the recent demand rebound (85) and the previous low April levels (avg 35), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (covering late March to early May) to capture a balanced average. Sigma will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the high volatility observed in this period range.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). At the start of Period 15 (May 20), we are exiting the spring season. Historical demand shows significant volatility: a high-demand regime in March (avg ~160), followed by a lower, inconsistent regime in April/May (avg ~45). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P11-P14) have seen demands of 37, 16, 85, and 33. The 'In-transit' quantity of 257 includes the 250 units from Period 1 that were previously identified as lost; effectively, the real pipeline inventory is 7 units (ordered in recent periods but not yet arrived). Because the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (257) to calculate orders, it will likely place a zero order unless base_stock exceeds 257. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%. The current demand average for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is ~61 units. To ensure the OR engine actually triggers a replenishment order despite the 'ghost' inventory of 250 units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock and the forecast. I estimate demand for (L+1=3) periods at ~180 units. Adding 250 units to offset the lost shipment in the pipeline calculation results in a mu_hat of 430. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (std dev of recent periods is ~30, so sqrt(3)*30 approx 52).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 250 'ghost' units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost. All future OR parameters must offset this 250-unit inflate to ensure replenishment orders are triggered.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 27th (Period 16). The product is cotton-lace thong briefs. Analysis of recent demand (Periods 11-15) show readings of 37, 16, 85, 33, 8, averaging ~36 units/week. This follows a volatile April. Lead times have been mostly 2 periods (P2 arrived P4, P6 arrived P8). However, the critical issue is the 250 units ordered in Period 1 that never arrived. The system sees 'In-transit: 430', which includes these 250 'ghost' units plus 7 units (P4) and 173 units (P15). Since the OR engine's order logic is 'base_stock - pipeline', and there are 0 units on-hand, an inflated pipeline inventory of 430 (instead of the 180 units actually coming) will prevent any new orders. To force the OR backend to order, I must increase mu_hat significantly to create a base_stock that exceeds the ghost inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 650 (approx (1+L) * 215) to ensure the system places a replenishment order immediately despite the 250-unit pipeline error. This value accounts for the ~180 true units coming and provides a buffer for current demand, while neutralizing the 250 ghost units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the SKU is currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count is 650 units, which includes 250 'ghost' units from Period 1 (confirmed lost), 173 units from Period 15 (lead time 2), and 220 units from Period 16 (lead time 2). The backend pipeline logic sees 650 units, but only 393 are actual arriving stock. To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order to cover the current demand and the stockout, I must use 'explicit' methods. For lead time, observed actuals (P2\u2192P4: 2, P6\u2192P8: 2, P7\u2192P8: 1) suggest the promised lead time of 2 is generally reliable. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods (P12-P16) show a decline: 16, 85, 33, 8, 8 (avg ~30). Considering the summer seasonality for lingerie, I will set mu_hat based on this recent average. To correct for the 250 lost units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*30 + 250 = 340. This forces the OR engine to 'see' a need for more units, effectively neutralizing the ghost inventory. Sigma_hat is set using a 5-period window to capture recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '465655010' (Womens Lingerie/Thongs) is currently in Period 18 (June). Historical data shows a significant demand peak in March (averaging ~160 units/week), followed by a sharp decline in April and May, with very low recent demand (averaging ~8 units/week in the last three periods). On-hand inventory is 384 units, which is extremely high relative to current demand. The pipeline inventory of 257 units includes the 250 units lost in Period 1 (confirmed 'ghost' units). The OR engine logic calculates order as min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). Since pipeline (257) + on-hand (384) = 641, and current demand is low, the system will naturally not order more. However, to ensure the 'ghost' units don't prevent future orders if demand spikes, I continue to use an 'explicit' L to track real lead-time behavior and 'recent_N' (N=5) for mu_hat covering the low-demand regime (May-June). Sigma is set to 'recent_N' to reflect current low volatility. No orders are expected or desired this period given the high excess stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (mid-June). Demand for this SKU has dropped significantly over the last four weeks (9, 1, 8, 8), averaging only 6.5 units per week, compared to the higher spring levels. On-hand inventory is 383, which is significantly higher than the current demand run-rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 257 includes the 250 units from Period 1 confirmed lost ('ghost units' as noted in carry-over insights). Subtracting these ghosts, the actual pipeline is effectively 7. However, with an on-hand stock of 383 and demand hovering near 1-10 units, we are overstocked and likely facing holding costs. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (last 4 periods) to prevent unnecessary replenishment while on-hand inventory depletes. No new orders should be triggered.

Carry-over insight: Demand entered a low-volume regime in June, averaging ~6.5 units/week (Periods 15-18).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The product (Womens Lingerie) has transitioned into a very low-demand regime since mid-May. For the last four periods (Periods 16-19), demand has been 8, 9, 1, and 1 respectively, averaging 4.75 units per week. This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 19 regarding a low-volume June regime (~6.5 units/week in Periods 15-18). We currently have 382 units on-hand, which at the current demand rate, represents over 60-80 weeks of inventory. The holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), making any excess inventory very expensive. In-transit inventory is listed as 257 units, which includes the 250 'ghost' units from Period 1 and a small 7-unit order from Period 4. Neither of these are likely to arrive. Given the massive inventory surplus (382 units vs. a demand of ~5/week), the priority is to avoid ordering anything further. I will set L to 'default' (2), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (this will result in a mu_hat of approx (1+2)*5 = 15), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5. Since the base_stock calculated by the backend (mu_hat + safety stock) will be significantly lower than the current pipeline (on-hand 382 + in-transit 257), no new orders will be triggered, which is the optimal decision.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. On-hand inventory is 281 units. Demand in Period 20 spiked significantly to 101 units, a sharp departure from the previous June average of ~6.5 units/week. This suggests a potential summer seasonality shift or a promotional event for this lingerie SKU. The 'In-transit' count of 257 includes the 250 'ghost' units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 7 units (257 - 250). My goal is to set parameters that trigger an order if the current on-hand (281) plus effective pipeline (7) is insufficient for the upcoming (L+1) periods. Given the recent spike, I will use a short window (N=3) for demand to capture the recent upward trend while maintaining a buffer for volatility. I will use an explicit L of 10 to intentionally suppress the 'ghost' units from the OR backend calculation without drastically over-ordering, as 281 units still provide substantial coverage for the immediate periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility observed in late June/early July: sharp increase from ~1 to 101 units. Monitoring to see if this reflects a July seasonal regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a high-demand July period. Demand in Period 20 (101) and Period 21 (274) represents a massive shift from the June average (~6.5). The current on-hand inventory is only 7 units, which is insufficient for the upcoming periods. We must account for the 250 'ghost units' from Period 1 that are still in 'in-transit' but will never arrive; since the pipeline inventory is 257 (250 ghost + 7 ordered in P7), the OR engine will see 257+7 and think we have plenty of stock unless we set mu_hat extremely high to force an order. However, the internal logic (base_stock - pipeline) will be triggered. To ensure a replenishment order is placed despite those 250 units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will forecast demand for the lead time (L=2) plus current period (1) based on the recent surge (avg ~187). Total needed = 187 * 3 = 561. To counteract the 250 ghost units, I will boost mu_hat further. Setting mu_hat to 850 and sigma_hat explicitly high (150) to ensure the OR backend generates a substantial order to cover the July peak.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge confirmed: Demand jumped from 101 to 274 units (+171%) in Periods 20-21. This indicates a high-volume seasonal regime for lingerie/thongs in mid-summer.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-15. Demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) has surged in July, with the last three periods recording demands of 101, 274, and 225. This confirms a significant high-volume seasonal regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system is backordered/unmet demand is high. Pipeline inventory is visible as 683 units, but 250 units from Period 1 have been confirmed 'ghost' units (lost) since Period 7. Subtracting these, the functional pipeline is 433 units (including the 426 units ordered last period). To ensure the OR backend triggers sufficient replenishment to meet this July surge despite the 250-unit pipeline inflation, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at approximately 233 units/week (average of the last 3 samples), totaling 700. To offset the 250 lost units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 950 (700 predicted demand + 250 offset). This ensures the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) accounts for the true availability. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to capture high recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-136.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand July seasonal regime. Demand in the last four periods has been 101, 274, 225, and 145, averaging 186.25 units per week, which is a massive increase compared to the early-June average of ~6.5. This aligns with the seasonal profile for 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p' (lingerie) in mid-summer. Lead times have recently been 1 period (observed in Period 23 for the Period 22 order), though the promised lead time remains 2. Pipeline inventory currently contains 517 units (250 lost from P1 + 267 ordered P23). Because of the 250 'ghost units' persisting in the pipeline since Period 1, I must set mu_hat high enough to ensure the OR backend (base_stock - pipeline) still triggers orders despite this phantom inventory. With holding cost equal to profit ($1.00), the backend targets a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current July peak (avg ~186.25), but I will apply an 'explicit' L of 2 for safety and use 'explicit' mu_hat to account for the ghost inventory and maintain availability.

Carry-over insight: July high-demand regime confirmed (Period 20-23): Average demand shifted to ~186 units/week compared to ~7 units/week in June.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand July seasonal regime (Periods 20-24), where weekly demand has averaged approximately 191 units (101, 274, 225, 145, 209). This is a significant jump from the June average of ~7 units. On-hand inventory is low (72 units). Pipeline inventory (569) includes 250 'ghost' units from Period 1 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 319 units (569 - 250). To ensure the OR backend accounts for these lost units and maintains the current high-demand service level, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the (L+1) period demand of the current regime. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (2+1) * 191 = 573. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high volatility (std dev of ~65 units/week in the recent regime, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~113).

Carry-over insight: July demand spike appears sustained through late July: average demand Periods 20-24 is 190.8 units compared to June average of 7.7. Effective pipeline must always subtract 250 units due to Period 1 lost shipment.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. The SKU is in a high-demand July/August seasonal regime. Historical demand for the last six periods (P20-P25) reflects this surge: 101, 274, 225, 145, 209, 154 (Avg: 184.6). The latest demand was 154, and we ended Period 25 with 0 on-hand inventory. Pipeline inventory is currently 569 units, but this includes 250 'ghost' units from the lost Period 1 shipment (as documented in Carry-over Insights). The true pipeline is 319 units (569 - 250). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P22 ordered and arrived in 1 period, P15/16 arrived in 2 and 1 respectively). For P26, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current seasonal demand regime (Avg ~185/week) and its volatility (Std ~60). Given the 250-unit ghost inventory inflating the backend's pipeline calculation, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target reach (3 periods of demand) PLUS the 250 units to force the OR engine to trigger a replenishment. Target reach = (L+1) * Mean = 3 * 185 = 555. Adding the 250 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 805.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 27 (mid-August). The July high-demand regime (Periods 20-25) averaged ~185 units/week. Period 26 showed a drop to 71 units, which could signal the end of the summer peak or just a temporary dip. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the high summer average while beginning to weight the recent drop. A critical adjustment is needed for the OR backend: there are 250 'ghost' units in the pipeline from a lost Period 1 shipment. To force the OR engine to order correctly despite this inflated pipeline total (currently 538 in-transit includes 250 units that will never arrive), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat: (1 + L) * average_demand(last 5) = 3 * 160.6 = 482. Adding the 250-unit offset to 'trick' the backend into ignoring the ghost units: 482 + 250 = 732. This ensures the engine replenishment logic (base_stock - pipeline) calculates an order based on real physical needs. Lead time 'calculate' is used as actual LT has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential end of summer peak (Demand dropped from ~188 avg to 71 in P26). Maintaining 250-unit ghost inventory offset in mu_hat to compensate for P1 lost shipment.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late August period (Period 28, 2019/08/19). Historical analysis shows a high-demand regime in July (averaging ~180-200 units) that spiked again in Period 27 (200 units) after a brief drop in Period 26 (71 units). The inventory is currently 0, with 538 units in-transit. However, 250 of those in-transit units are 'ghost' units from a lost shipment in Period 1, making the effective pipeline only 288 units (orders from P24 and P26). Because lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, I will use lead time L=2. To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment despite the ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate demand at 120 units per week (accounting for the end-of-summer slowdown while acknowledging the recent 200-unit spike). For a (L+1) period coverage, mu_hat = 3 * 120 = 360 units. To offset the 250 ghost units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation (Order = base_stock - pipeline), I add 250 to mu_hat, resulting in a target mu_hat of 610. Sigma_hat is set to 150 (explicit) to account for high volatility observed in the transition out of the summer peak.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit is 610 units, but 250 units from Period 1 must be discounted as 'ghost' units (confirmed lost), leaving an effective pipeline of 360 units (P24: 45, P26: 236, P28: 72). Demand remains high despite a brief dip in Period 26; the last two periods saw demand return to ~200 units (P27: 200, P28: 191). The July-August high-season average is approximately 188 units. To ensure the backend triggers an order despite the 250 ghost units inflating the in-transit field, I must adjust mu_hat upward using the 'explicit' method. An appropriate base_stock target to cover L+1 periods (lead time 2 + current period) at 188 units/week is ~564 units. However, because the backend logic is (order = base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline is incorrectly seen as 610 instead of 360, I must set the mu_hat parameter to include an additional 250-unit offset (564 + 250 = 814). This ensures the OR engine calculates a net replenishment need that accounts for the lost P1 units. L is set to 'calculate' to use historical lead time performance (avg ~2).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Post-August demand remains strong (~195 avg for P27-P28), contradicting the P26 slowdown. Pipeline adjustment of +250 units in mu_hat remains mandatory to offset Period 1 lost shipment.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Ginger Thong Maple Low 3p' remains in a high-volume regime (Periods 27-29 average: 190.3 units), despite a temporary dip in Period 26. We are currently at Period 30 (Sept 2), and late summer/early autumn demand is holding steady. A critical persistent issue is the 250 units ordered in Period 1 that are confirmed lost; the OR backend still counts these in 'In-transit', preventing necessary replenishment. Consequently, we must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. At ~190 units/period, base stock should be ~570. The current in-transit (814) includes 250 'ghost' units, so functional pipeline is 564. To trigger an order that maintains this level and accounts for the ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the average demand (190) multiplied by (L+1) plus the 250-unit offset: (190 * 3) + 250 = 820. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation yields a positive order. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to capture the current high volatility.

The average of the last 4 periods (P27-P30) is 160.25. The Period 1 shipment of 250 units is confirmed lost; since the OR backend includes all 'in-transit' units in its logic, the 250 ghost units artificially inflate pipeline inventory, causing the engine to under-order. To counteract this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly higher to 'bait' the engine into ordering the correct amount. Target mu_hat calculation: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Lost_Units. With L=2, the forecast period is 3 weeks. Forecasted weekly demand is ~160. Target Base Stock = (160 * 3) + 250 = 730. However, the backend treats mu_hat as (1+L)*mean. If I set mu_hat to 730, the backend will think I want 730/3 per week. To ensure the order triggers correctly despite the 250 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to provide enough headroom. On-hand is 2, In-transit is 748 (498 real + 250 ghost). Current real pipeline is 500 units covering ~3 weeks of demand. We are at risk if demand stays at 190. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 800 to ensure replenishment occurs while accounting for the lost 250 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has shown a significant drop in the last two periods (70 and 33 units) compared to the August average (~190), suggesting the end of the high-summer peak. I am transitioning to a lower demand forecast. I must maintain the critical offset for the 250 units in-transit from Period 1 that are confirmed lost; these units 'ghost' the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, preventing it from ordering until I adjust. My mu_hat calculation will use a recent N (last 5 periods) to capture the cooling trend while still accounting for the 250-unit offset. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals have varied between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: September demand slowdown confirmed: Demand dropped from ~190 avg in Aug to ~51 avg in the first two weeks of Sept. Continuing manual offset of +250 in mu_hat to negate the Period 1 lost shipment.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 465655010 (Womens Thong Underwear) is currently in a low-demand regime following the summer peak (July-August). Demand in September has stabilized at a significantly lower level: Period 30 (70), Period 31 (33), and Period 32 (25), averaging approximately 42.6 units per week. This is a sharp contrast to the August average of ~190. Additionally, the system still carries 250 'ghost' units from a lost Period 1 shipment in the pipeline (In-transit), which prevents the OR backend from placing necessary replenishment orders unless compensated for. To address both the seasonal slowdown and the inventory discrepancy, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate forward demand at ~40 units per week. For a lead time (L) of 2, the required coverage is (1+L) = 3 weeks. Therefore, the real required mu_hat is 40 * 3 = 120. To offset the 250 units that the OR backend incorrectly believes are coming, I add 250 to this value, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 370. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger orders despite the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the current period's volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime shift confirmed: average demand decreased from ~190 in August to ~43 in September. Continued requirement to manually offset +250 units in mu_hat to negate 'ghost' inventory from Period 1 lost shipment.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 465655010 has shifted into a lower-volume regime for September, with an average demand of approximately 38 units/week over the last four periods (P30-P33), significantly down from the ~190 avg in August. Current on-hand is 6 and in-transit is 742. However, 250 units in the in-transit/pipeline total are 'ghost' units from a lost shipment in Period 1. The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). To prevent the engine from being suppressed by these 250 non-existent units, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for the current regime (L=2) is approximately (1+2)*38 = 114 units. To offset the 250 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 114 + 250 = 364. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility of the current regime. This ensures that when the backend subtracts the 742 units (which includes the 250 ghost units), the resulting order correctly ignores the lost stock while maintaining a lean inventory for the current low-demand period.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has shifted to a lower regime in September/October, averaging approximately 23.2 units over the last 5 weeks (P30-P34: 70, 33, 25, 25, 10), reflecting the end of the summer peak. The In-transit inventory of 742 units currently includes 250 'ghost units' from a lost Period 1 shipment, which the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must manually offset this 250-unit inflation by adding it to mu_hat. For the demand forecast, I am using a recent_N window of 5 periods to capture the current low-volume autumn regime. Lead time remains approximately 2 periods based on history.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Ginger Thong has stabilized in a low-volume regime following the end of the summer seasonal peak. Demand in the last four periods (P32-P35) has been consistent at low levels: 25, 25, 10, and 5 units respectively (average ~16 units/week). Mid-October is historically a stable period for basic lingerie items before any holiday surges. Regarding inventory: the 'In-transit' figure of 742 units is heavily skewed by 250 'ghost units' from the lost Period 1 order and recent unarrived orders from P24 (45 units), P26 (236 units), and P29 (204 units). Calculating current pipeline: total in-transit 742 - 250 (lost P1) = 492 real units expected. With demand currently averaging ~16 units, the 492 units in the pipeline (plus the 0 on-hand) provide significant coverage (approx. 30 weeks), far exceeding the 3-period (L+1) planning horizon. Therefore, the OR backend should not trigger any new orders. To ensure the OR engine recognizes this surplus despite the 250-unit ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4-week regime and sigma_hat similarly. No manual mu_hat offset is needed this period because the real pipeline is so large that even with the 250-unit undercount, the effective base stock remains below the pipeline level.

Carry-over insight: October demand remains in the low-volume post-summer regime, averaging ~16 units/week (P32-P35).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 21, 2019. The SKU 465655010 (Womens Underwear/Thongs) is currently in a low-volume post-summer regime. Demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) has been 25, 25, 10, 5, 6, averaging ~14 units/week. This represents a significant drop from the summer average of ~190 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is currently 742 units, which includes 250 units from the P1 lost shipment and orders from P24 (45), P26 (236), and P29 (204) that haven't arrived yet. The P1 'ghost' units (250) inflate the pipeline and would prevent the OR backend from ordering. To mitigate this and trigger necessary replenishment for the low-volume regime, I am using an explicit mu_hat that includes the 250-unit offset. Given the current low demand, I will set a stable forecast based on the last 5 weeks of data (N=5), resulting in a mean demand of ~14. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L) * 14 + 250 = 292. This ensures the 250 units is 'ignored' by the inventory subtraction logic.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a very low-demand regime (October/late October), with demand for the last few periods (P34-P37) being 10, 5, 6, and 1 respectively. This follows a significant drop from the summer peak. On-hand inventory is 0, but in-transit inventory is very high at 742 units. A crucial 'ghost' inventory issue exists: 250 units from a Period 1 order were confirmed lost (see Period 7/15 insights) but remain in the 'in-transit' calculation. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 742 - 250 = 492 units. Even with this correction, 492 units is far in excess of the current average demand (approx. 5.5 units/week since P34). No further ordering is required. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 'excess' pipeline and never ordering when demand eventually recovers, I will maintain the manual offset logic. For this period, I choose recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the current low-volume reality (~5.5 units/week) and will use the default lead time (2). The sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect low volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for this SKU has dropped significantly after the summer peak, averaging approximately 5-6 units/week over the last 7 periods (P32-P38). The inventory system shows 0 on-hand and 742 units in-transit. However, 250 of those in-transit units are 'ghost' units from a lost Period 1 shipment. To allow the OR backend to properly calculate replenishment, I must continue to manually offset these ghost units. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', and my goal is to counteract the +250 in-transit error, I set mu_hat = ((1 + L) * expected_demand) + 250. With L=2, the base stock will be roughly (3 * 5) + 250 = 265. This will trigger the backend to see the effective pipeline as 492 (742-250) and compare it against a target that accounts for the loss. Given the current massive overstock in the pipeline (actual 492 units in-transit vs demand of ~5/week), no new orders will be placed, which is correct as current stock covers over 90 weeks of demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this SKU has dropped significantly since the summer peak, entering a low-volume regime in Oct/Nov with demand rarely exceeding 6 units per week. Specifically, demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) has been [5, 6, 1, 2, 0], averaging 2.8 units/week.  There is a critical accounting issue with the 'In-transit' pipeline: 742 units are listed, but 250 of these are 'ghost' units from a lost shipment in Period 1 (confirmed in Carry-over insights). Additionally, 204 units from Period 29 (lead time was expected to be ~2) are now 11 periods past due and are likely lost, and 236 units from Period 26 are 14 periods past due. Effectively, the real pipeline is likely close to 0 or only consists of very recent orders if any existed. However, on-hand is 0. To trigger the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I am forecasting a base demand of ~5 units/week. Given a lead time of 2, a (1+L) base would be 15 units. To offset the 250 ghost units from P1 and the likely lost units from P26/P29, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome (base_stock - pipeline). Since pipeline (742) is much larger than current needs, I will use a high explicit mu_hat to ensure some safety stock is maintained, as the OR engine subtracts pipeline from the calculated base stock level. I'll target an order that brings us to about 50 units on hand to cover the low-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Shipments from Period 26 (236 units) and Period 29 (204 units) are now presumed lost alongside the Period 1 (250 units) shipment, totaling 690 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory.

We are now in Period 41 (mid-November). The product is a lingerie thong. Current on-hand inventory is 0.

These 'ghost' units (totaling 690) prevent the OR backend from ordering because it believes they are arriving. Demand is currently in a very low regime (averaging ~4 units over the last 5 weeks). To trigger a replenishment order despite the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that covers the expected demand plus the total lost shipment volume. I estimate the base demand for the next 3 weeks (L+1) at approximately 30 units (anticipating a slight pre-holiday uptick) and add the 690 units of lost pipeline to ensure the order is placed. Sigma_hat is set to cover the high historical volatility of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative 'ghost' inventory in pipeline now 690 units (P1: 250, P26: 236, P29: 204). All future mu_hat parameters must include a +690 offset to force replenishment until these are cleared or reconciled.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25. We are entering the Late November/December shopping season. Demand in Period 41 spiked to 61 units, suggesting a pre-holiday ramp-up from the low-volume October regime (avg ~16). Inventory remains critical: In-transit is 750 units, but 690 are confirmed lost or effectively missing (P1: 250, P26: 236, P29: 204). Only the P40 order of 8 units and the residual 52 'real' units in the pipeline (if any) are valid. Since 'total pipeline' as seen by the OR backend includes these 690 ghost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to trigger an order. I will forecast a holiday mean of 50 units/week. Target Base Stock = (1+L) * 50 = 3 * 50 = 150. To overcome the 690-unit pipeline distortion and actually place an order, I set mu_hat to 150 + 690 = 840 using the explicit method. This ensures the backend sees (840 - 750) as requiring replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed holiday demand ramp-up in Period 41 (61 units). Cumulative 'ghost' inventory persists at 690 units (P1, P26, P29 orders).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), we are entering the peak December holiday shopping season. Demand in Period 42 was 379 units, confirming a massive seasonal spike for this SKU (likely related to Black Friday/Cyber Monday and holiday gifting). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 840 units. However, based on history, 690 of these 'in-transit' units are 'ghosts' from lost shipments (P1: 250, P26: 236, P29: 204). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 840 units and refuse to order. To force a replenishment order, I must set mu_hat to cover both the forecasted demand for the lead time and the ghost inventory. Forecast: Given the peak season, I expect demand to remain high (averaging ~200-300 units). For a 2-period lead time (L+1=3 periods), demand is ~600-900 units. Adding the 690-unit offset, mu_hat must be at least 1300-1600. I will set mu_hat to 1500 and sigma_hat explicitly high (300) to ensure a robust base stock that triggers an order despite the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak confirmed: Period 42 demand spiked to 379 units. Ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 690 units; mu_hat must continue to include this offset until resolved.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of the December holiday season (Dec 9). Period 42 saw a massive spike of 379 units, followed by a lull of 3 units in Period 43. This high volatility is characteristic of holiday shopping (spikes followed by inventory stockouts or technical oscillations). Demand forecasting must remain aggressive to capture the remaining December peak. Regarding inventory: the 'In-transit' figure of 1492 units includes significant 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (250), P26 (236), and P29 (204), totaling 690 units. These orders are long overdue and presumed lost. To ensure the OR backend (which relies on 'In-transit') triggers necessary orders, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by +690. Given the holiday season, I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting high seasonal demand (approx 250 units/period) plus the 690-unit offset: (1+L)*250 + 690. With L=2, this is 3*250 + 690 = 1440. Sigma_hat is set high to handle the proven extreme volatility of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative ghost inventory remains 690 units (P1, P26, P29). December demand remains highly volatile; maintaining manual mu_hat offset of +690 to force replenishment despite bloated 'In-transit' figures.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-December holiday peak (Period 45). Demand in the last few weeks has been extremely volatile: P41 (61), P42 (379), P43 (3), and P44 (11). The sudden drop in P43-P44 likely reflects a stockout at the start of those periods rather than a lack of interest, as on-hand inventory was zero or near-zero. A cumulative 690 units from P1, P26, and P29 are confirmed lost, inflating the 'In-transit' figure to 1492. To bypass the OR backend's logic which stops ordering when pipeline inventory is high, I must provide a mu_hat that covers both expected holiday demand and the 690 lost units. The holiday peak in Period 42 (379 units) suggests a spike regime. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 1200 (approx. 3 periods of 400 demand) to ensure the system places a replenishment order despite the 'ghost' inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average performance (~2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Holiday peak confirmed by P42 spike (379). Ghost inventory remains 690 units. Stockouts in P43-P44 masked true demand due to zero on-hand inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the Christmas/New Year holiday week (Dec 23). Historical demand for this 'Womens Lingerie/Thong' SKU shows massive volatility: a significant holiday peak was observed in P42 (379 units), though recent weeks (P43-P45) show lower demand (8-11 units). However, P43-P44 demand was likely suppressed by stockouts. In P45, we received 750 units (completing orders from P42 and P43), leaving us with 742 units on-hand. Crucially, we have 690 'ghost' units in 'In-transit' from lost shipments (P1: 250, P26: 236, P29: 204) that the OR engine counts as available inventory even though they will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly stopping orders, we generally increase mu_hat. However, with 742 units currently on-hand and the Christmas peak theoretically passing its apex, the current stock is likely sufficient for the immediate post-holiday period. I will set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the ghost units (690) plus a modest buffer for late-December/early-January demand. Setting mu_hat to 800 (690 ghost + ~110 forecasted demand for L+1 periods) ensures the system doesn't over-order while we have high physical stock, but remains 'aware' of the pipeline inflation.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 47 (Dec 30). The holiday peak (P42, demand 379) has passed, and demand has sharply dropped to single digits in the last three weeks (P44: 11, P45: 8, P46: 5). The large replenishment orders from P42 and P43 (totaling 750 units) arrived in P45, resulting in a high on-hand inventory of 737 units. This finally resolves the stockout situation. However, we still have 690 'ghost' units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P26, and P29) that never arrived. Although we currently have plenty of stock, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 742 'In-transit' units (690 ghost + 52 pending from earlier periods) and might under-order if demand spikes again. Since we are moving into January, historical data from P1-P4 (Feb/Mar) suggests a return to moderate demand. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on recent low demand but maintain the +690 offset strategy to ensure the OR engine doesn't incorrectly believe we have those 690 ghost units available for future demand. The actual demand is currently very low, so I will set mu_hat to cover a baseline of ~15 units/week plus the offset.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand collapse: demand dropped from 379 (P42) to an average of 8 units (P44-P46). Inventory levels are now high (737 units) following the arrival of P42/P43 orders.
