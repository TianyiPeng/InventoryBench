Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 316441001, a women's long-sleeved jersey top. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 102, 89, 87, 148, 148. The most recent two weeks show a significant jump to 148 units, suggesting a potential regime shift or early spring seasonality for basics. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the general average while acknowledging the recent uptick. Since L=2, the total window for mu_hat and sigma_hat is L+1=3 periods. The mean of the 5 samples is 114.8. Therefore, the target mu_hat (for 3 periods) is 114.8 * 3 = 344.4. The standard deviation of the 5 samples is approximately 31.36. For sigma_hat over 3 periods, this scales to 31.36 * sqrt(3) \u2248 54.3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to allow the backend to compute these statistics from the provided history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand in January and early February ranges from 87 to 148, with the most recent sample at 148. In Period 1, actual demand was 82, and we have an stockout situation because initial on-hand was 0. The order of 166 placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 2. Following the lead time rules, we expect this to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0. Demand for the last 5 samples (102, 89, 87, 148, 148) plus the new P1 data (82) suggests a mean of approx 109. Given we are in mid-February, we should prepare for steady transitions out of winter basics. mu_hat will use recent_N to capture the most relevant demand behavior (N=6 includes all known data points). sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all available samples to capture volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Feb 25th, Period 3. The SKU is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top'. Historical demand in January and February ranged from 87 to 148, with the most recent sample at 148. In-game, we have seen demands of 82 and 138. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) because orders from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 2 (160 units) have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2. Following the lead time rules, the Period 1 order should arrive DURING Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, there is no evidence of lead time drift or lost shipments yet. For parameters, I will use a recent demand window to capture the current level (averaging 148, 82, and 138 is ~123). Setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 in-game samples + last 2 historical samples (148, 148, 82, 138) to provide a stable forecast. L remains at the promised default.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top, a staple item. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand) because we have yet to receive any shipments. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (166 units) should have arrived during Period 3 and been visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Since 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 3, the shipment from Period 1 is either delayed or lost. However, it is too early to confirm a permanent lead-time shift or loss after only one missed window. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 114 units (Samples: 102, 89, 87, 148, 148) and recent game demand has been 82, 138, and 106. The standard deviation of all samples is roughly 30. Given the stockouts (sold=0 for 3 periods), we must maintain aggressive base stock levels to recover once shipments arrive. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the last 5 demand samples) and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to maintain stability while the supply chain resolves.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic long-sleeved jersey top. Current date is March 11, which marks the transition into early spring. Historical demand (P1-P4: 82, 138, 106, 60) shows significant variance but no clear seasonal trend yet. The last demand sample (60) is lower than the initial samples, suggesting a possible stabilization or slight cooling of demand. Lead time: Promised is 2. The Period 2 order arrived exactly 2 periods later (in P4). However, the Period 1 order (166 units) has NOT arrived as of the P4 conclusion. If L=2, the P1 order should have arrived in P3. Since it is now P5 and we have seen P4 conclude without its arrival, the shipment from P1 is likely lost. I will stick to L=2 for now but will monitor for systematic delays. For mu_hat, the mean of all samples (including the seed data: 102, 89, 87, 148, 148 and the observed data: 82, 138, 106, 60) is approximately 107. Since demand is somewhat erratic, using N=5 (most recent observations + seed) captures current dynamics. The backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 254 (P3: 85, P4: 3, plus presumably the lost P1: 166). If 166 is lost, actual pipeline is ~88. To ensure the backend orders to replenish, I will use recent_N for both mu and sigma to stay reactive to the recent lower demand while accounting for the missing stock through the pipeline calculation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a women's basic long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand shows a peak in late January/early February (avg ~115) followed by a cooling period in March (avg ~61). Current on-hand inventory is 37 units. Total in-transit is 275 units. Looking at the history: P1 order (166 units) has NOT arrived yet (promised L=2, now overdue 3 periods). P2 order (160 units) arrived in P4 (L=2). P3 order (85 units) is due now. The delay of the P1 order is concerning; it may be lost or significantly delayed. However, since the P2 order arrived on time, we will maintain L=default but increase the safety stock (sigma_hat) to account for supply uncertainty. For demand, we observe a regime shift starting P4 (avg ~61.5 vs previous ~115). N=3 is used for mu_hat to capture this recent lower demand level while we monitor for any spring seasonal shifts.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is March 25th. Product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand shows a peak in late Jan/early Feb (avg ~115) followed by a moderation in March (avg ~62). The SKU is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0). Looking at history: Order P1 (166 units) is missing after 6 periods (lost); Order P2 arrived in 2 periods; Order P3 (85 units) is overdue (placed 4 periods ago); Order P4 (3 units) is overdue; Order P5 arrived in 1 period. Lead times are volatile (1 or 2 periods) or shipments are lost. Given the stock-out and missing inventory (P1, P3, P4), I will use 'explicit' for L to account for uncertainty and 'recent_N' for demand to reflect the current lower demand regime (N=3: P4-P6 mean ~62). The OR engine needs to rebuild the buffer for the L+1 period coverage while respecting the lower recent mean to avoid over-ordering long-term.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (166 units) likely lost (6 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Shipment from Period 3 (85 units) overdue (4 periods elapsed). Demand regime shift at Period 4: average demand dropped from ~115 to ~62 (-46%).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 8 (2019/4/1). Inventory is critical (on-hand 0). We face significant supply chain issues: the Period 1 order (166 units) is lost, and the Period 3 order (85 units) is now 5 periods overdue against a promised lead time of 2. However, a Period 5 order arrived in just 1 period (observed in Period 6), showing high volatility in arrival times. Demand analysis: Samples (102, 89, 87, 148, 148, 82, 138, 106) shifted down starting Period 4. The last four demand samples are 60, 63, 64, 60 (avg 61.75). With the current date in April, we expect steady 'Womens Everyday Basics' demand without a seasonal spike yet. I will set L=4 (explicit) to account for recent arrival delays while mu_hat/sigma_hat will use the recent regime (N=4) to avoid over-ordering based on the older, higher demand mean. Setting L higher ensures the 'base_stock' covers more periods of demand, helping mitigate the risk of lost/late shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as highly volatile: Period 2 and 5 orders arrived with L=2 and L=1 respectively, but Period 1 (L=7+) and Period 3 (L=5+) are missing or significantly delayed.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019/4/8). The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top. Historical demand shifted at Period 4, dropping from a mean of ~115 (Periods 1-3) to a stable regime of ~62 (Periods 4-8). Lead times are highly unreliable: Order P1 (166 units) is lost (8 periods elapsed), and Order P3 (85 units) is significantly overdue (6 periods elapsed). Orders P2 and P5 arrived with L=2 and L=1 respectively. I am setting L=3 'explicitly' to account for the supply chain instability and to allow the OR backend to calculate a larger safety buffer (L+1 demand). mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the post-Period 4 demand regime (mean ~62), which results in a mu_hat of ~248 (4 * 62). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current period's lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Supply chain instability confirmed; Order P1 (166 units) is considered permanently lost, and Order P3 (85 units) remains missing after 6 periods. Setting effective lead time to 3 to buffer against delays.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019-04-15), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The core issue remains supply chain instability: the Period 1 order (166 units) is lost, and the Period 3 order (85 units) is now 7 periods overdue, implying it is likely lost as well. Total in-transit is 313, but at least 251 (166+85) are non-deliverable. Actual observed lead times for successful arrivals were L=2 (P2) and L=1 (P5). However, to account for the risk of missing shipments and the current stockout, I will maintain an explicit lead time of 3 to increase the base stock calculation, effectively buffering the pipeline. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 4 (average ~60). I'm using N=6 for mu_hat (covering Periods 4-9) to reflect this lower, stable demand (avg 59.6). Sigma_hat uses the same window to capture recent volatility without being skewed by the initial high-demand launch phase.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists; Period 3 order (85 units) is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost. Only Period 2 and 5 orders have successfully arrived.

The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top', an everyday basic. Starting in Period 4, demand shifted from a mean of ~115 to a stable lower regime of ~58 (periods 4-10: 60, 63, 64, 60, 61, 50, 34). Period 10 shows a further dip (34), possibly due to the transition into warmer weather. Inventory management has been plagued by supply chain issues: orders from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (85 units) are now 10 and 8 periods overdue respectively and are considered lost. The Period 8 order (59 units) arrived on time in Period 10 (L=2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 25. The backend pipeline logic counts 'In-transit' (254 units), which includes the 166 (P1) and 85 (P3) lost units. To trigger a corrective order and prevent stockouts despite these phantom units, I must increase mu_hat (the target base stock) significantly. I will use 'explicit' for L=2 (promised/recent) and 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it at 375. This value accounts for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~180 units) plus a buffer for the 251 lost units that the OR backend currently thinks are coming, minus current on-hand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/4/29. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 4, averaging ~54 units over the last 8 periods (recent_N=8). Supply chain instability is a major factor: orders from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (85 units) are now 11 and 9 periods overdue respectively and are treated as permanently lost. Recent successful deliveries from Periods 2, 5, and 8 show lead times of 2, 1, and 2 periods respectively, but the high failure rate of previous shipments necessitates a conservative lead time estimate. On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 11's demand. There are 366 units in-transit, but 251 of those (P1+P3) are likely lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 115 units (primarily from the P11 order). To account for the risk of lost shipments and ensure a sufficient service level for this 'Jersey Basic' top, I am setting L=3 to buffer against the volatility, and using the recent low-demand regime (N=8) for forecasting. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean_demand, where mean_demand is ~54, resulting in 216.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability remains poor: 68% of initial orders (P1 and P3) are permanently lost. Recent successful lead times (P2, P5, P8) average 1.67 periods, but the effective lead time must be inflated to L=3 to compensate for the high stockout risk caused by intermittent total shipment loss.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top) is currently in a lower demand regime which stabilizes around 42-43 units per week following a drop in March. Current date is early May, which typically signals a transition out of long-sleeved jersey demand towards summer wear, though basics remain relatively steady. The primary challenge is supply chain reliability: orders from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (85 units) are lost. This creates a ghost 'pipeline inventory' in the OR backend's logic because those units have not 'concluded'. Since the backend uses (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders, the 251 lost units (166+85) plus the P11 order (112) total 363 units currently in-transit. With on-hand at 0 and demand around 40, the backend will order nothing unless the target base stock exceeds 363 units. Given the lost units effectively zero out the pipeline's utility, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to buffer against delays and 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+3)*200 = 800. Setting mu_hat to 800 (representing 200 units/period) is a tactical adjustment to force the OR backend to place an order despite the 363 units of 'ghost' inventory. This compensates for the fact that the backend thinks we have 366 units coming, when in reality only 112 are likely to arrive. Sigma_hat is set to a higher value (100) to account for demand volatility and the high risk of stockouts seen in the history.

Carry-over insight: Current pipeline inventory (366 units) is heavily inflated by lost orders from P1 and P3 (total 251 units). Backend parameters must be aggressively set (mu_hat/base stock) to override this ghost inventory and trigger replenishment.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14 (2019/5/13), we are managing a 'Womens Everyday Basics' long-sleeved top. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 4, averaging 49.9 units per period over the last 10 periods. The critical issue remains supply chain reliability: Orders from Period 1 (166 units) and Period 3 (85 units) are definitely lost (11+ periods elapsed). These 251 units are 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (In-transit=537), which tricks the OR backend into under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Avg demand (last 10 periods) = ~50. Effective L = 3 (conservative buffer due to losses). Target mu_hat = (1 + L) * Avg_Demand = (1 + 3) * 50 = 200. I am also adding a significant buffer to mu_hat (setting to 475) to offset the 251 units of lost pipeline inventory, ensuring the backend triggers an order to maintain stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Persistent 'ghost inventory' of 251 units (P1: 166, P3: 85) confirmed lost; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset this pipeline error until the orders are removed or ignored by the backend.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for SKU 316441001 is dominated by supply chain instability and 'ghost inventory'. Order P1 (166 units) and P3 (85 units) are now 14 and 12 periods overdue respectively, and are considered permanently lost. However, the backend still counts these 251 units as 'in-transit', which suppresses new orders. There are also P13 (283 units) and P15 (no order yet) in the mix. The current visible pipeline is 537 units: P1(166) + P3(85) + P11(0 arrived) + P13(283) + P15(0). Since P11 arrived in P13, the current in-transit represents P1(166), P3(85), and P13(283). Total ghost inventory = 251. Mean demand since the regime shift in Period 4 is approximately 52 units/period (avg of P4-P14). To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must set the mu_hat to cover the expected demand across (L+1) periods PLUS the ghost inventory of 251 units. With an effective lead time L=3 to buffer against delays, we need (3+1) periods of demand which is 4 * 52 = 208 units, plus the 251 units offset, totaling 459. Setting mu_hat to 460. Sigma_hat is kept at an explicit level to handle the volatility of recent demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the product (Long-sleeved jersey top) is heading into the summer months (June/July). Historical demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~45-50 units per week since Period 4, down from the initial peak of ~115. The 'In-transit' figure of 537 is highly misleading because it includes 251 units from Period 1 and Period 3 that are over 13 periods old and clearly lost. There is also an order of 283 units from Period 13 which is now due (P13 + promised L=2 = Period 15 arrival, observed at start of P16). However, the conclude message for P15 does not show this arrival, suggesting it is at least 1 period delayed or potentially lost. With On-hand inventory at 0 and current demand around 50, there is a severe stockout risk. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 251 units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set L=3 to account for frequent delays. I calculate the target base stock (mu_hat) by taking (1+L) * mean_demand (approx 4 * 50 = 200) and adding the 251 units of ghost inventory to 'neutralize' them in the backend's subtraction (200 + 251 = 451). This should trigger an order of approximately 168 units (451 - 283 active in-transit = 168).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Confirmed that P13 order (283 units) is delayed (3 periods elapsed). Pipeline inventory currently contains 251 units of 'ghost inventory' (P1, P3) and 283 units of potentially delayed or lost inventory (P13). Total pipeline reliability is low.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), the SKU 316441001 is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory of 537 units is severely misleading due to confirmed lost shipments: P1 (166 units), P3 (85 units), and now highly likely P13 (283 units, 4 periods elapsed vs. promised 2). Total 'ghost inventory' is 534 units (166+85+283), meaning nearly the entire 'In-transit' count is unreliable. Customer demand has stabilized at ~45 units/period (mean of last 7 samples is 44.5). To trigger a replenishment order and bypass the OR backend's inventory cap logic\u2014which subtracts the 537 pipeline units from the base stock\u2014I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1 with L=3) plus the 534 ghost units to ensure a fresh order is generated. I keep sigma_hat at recent_N (N=7) to reflect current demand volatility (~11.6 units) and set L to 3 to provide extra safety time due to the verified supply chain fragility.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: P13 order (283 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining P1 (166) and P3 (85) as ghost inventory (total 534 units). This necessitates massive explicit inflation of mu_hat to force the backend to ignore the falsified pipeline and order new units.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. There are 534 units of 'ghost inventory' currently in-transit that have effectively been lost: P1 (166 units, 17 periods elapsed), P3 (85 units, 15 periods elapsed), and P13 (283 units, 5 periods elapsed). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) assumes these units will arrive, preventing it from placing necessary new orders. At Period 18, On-hand is 0. Demand since Period 4 has averaged approximately 48 units/period. To override the 534-unit ghost pipeline and secure a 4-period safety stock (L=3 plus current period) at the current demand rate, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the ghost pipeline plus the desired base stock. Target Base Stock = (3+1) * 48 = 192 units. To trigger this order while the backend sees 534 units in-transit, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 800 (calculated as roughly 534 ghost units + 200 units for stock coverage + buffer for sigma) to force a positive order signal despite the falsified pipeline. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the high probability of delays.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: Aggregate ghost inventory in pipeline increased to 534 units (P1, P3, P13). Shipment P13 (283 units) is now 5 periods overdue and considered lost. Total reliability is <40% for shipments.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show extreme instability. Currently, 534 units in the pipeline are confirmed lost: P1 (166), P3 (85), and P13 (283). These units are 18, 16, and 6 periods old, respectively, and will never arrive, yet they inflate the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. To force the system to order despite this 534-unit 'ghost inventory', mu_hat must be explicitly set to a value that exceeds $(1+L) 	imes 	ext{Expected Demand} + 	ext{Ghost Inventory}$. 

Recent demand (Periods 17-18) has dropped significantly to an average of ~20 units/week, likely due to seasonality of a 'Long-sleeved top' as we move into summer (June). However, using a lower demand forecast would prevent the system from overcoming the ghost inventory. I am setting L=3 to account for historical delays. For mu_hat, I will use $ (1+3) 	imes 40 	ext{ (avg recent demand regime)} + 534 	ext{ (ghost inventory)} = 694 $. This forces the backend to recognize that even with 534 units arriving, we would still be short, thus triggering a replenishment order to satisfy actual customer demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Aggregate ghost inventory in pipeline remains 534 units (P1, P3, P13). Shipment P13 is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Seasonal demand for long-sleeved tops in June indicates a cooling regime (~20 units/period), but parameter inflation is required to bypass pipeline errors.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (late June), demand for this long-sleeved top has cooled significantly, dropping to an average of ~15 units over the last 3 periods (23, 16, 5). However, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from P1 (166), P3 (85), and P13 (283) are confirmed lost, totaling 534 units that the backend incorrectly views as incoming. To trigger any necessary replenishment despite this 534-unit pipeline error, I must set an explicit mu_hat that covers both the actual forecasted demand and the ghost inventory. Forecasted demand for the review+lead window (L+1=4) is approximately 60-80 units. Adding the 534 units of lost inventory, I set mu_hat to 620 to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order if on-hand inventory dips further. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the extreme supply chain volatility (erratic lead times and frequent lost shipments).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified ghost inventory persists at 534 units (P1, P3, P13). New order from P18 arrived with L=1, showing that while some shipments arrive quickly, the loss rate remains ~60%. Seasonal demand is at a trough (~15 units/period).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are in a low-demand summer trough for this long-sleeved top, with demand dropping significantly from ~40-60 units in spring to ~5-15 units recently (last 2 periods demand: 5, 6). The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a ~60% loss rate. Specifically, 534 units in the pipeline from Periods 1, 3, and 13 (166+85+283) are confirmed 'ghost inventory' that will likely never arrive. Additionally, the order from Period 17 (194 units) is now 4 periods old (promised 2) and is trending toward being lost. Currently, we have 81 units on-hand, which covers over 5 periods of current demand (~15 units/period). However, the OR backend sees 731 units in-transit (534 confirmed lost + 194 likely lost + 3 from P4). To prevent the backend from being paralyzed by this fake pipeline, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. Even though demand is low, the base stock calculation (mu_hat - pipeline) needs a high enough mu_hat to overcome the ~731 unit pipeline deficit if we want to maintain safety stock. I will set L=3 to account for variability and mu_hat to 800 (offsetting the ghost inventory + providing safety stock for 4 periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains 534 units (P1, P3, P13). Period 17 order (194 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, potentially increasing ghost inventory to 728 units. Current demand is in a seasonal trough (~10 units/period).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 ('Long-sleeved top') is currently in a seasonal demand trough (July), with recent demand averaging ~10 units per period. However, the system faces a severe 'ghost inventory' problem. The pipeline (In-transit: 744) is heavily inflated by lost orders: P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), and now almost certainly P17 (194), totaling 728 units of lost/ghost inventory. Only 16 units in the pipeline (the P21 order) are likely valid. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 744 units of pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to exceed this phantom value. To ensure the backend covers seasonal demand (~10 units/period) while ignoring the 728 units of ghost inventory, I set mu_hat to 768 (728 ghost units + 40 units for 4 periods of demand cover). This forced inflation bypasses the pipeline error. Sigma is set to recent levels (N=5) to reflect the low current volatility of the seasonal trough.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Ghost inventory in pipeline confirmed at 728 units (P1, P3, P13, and now P17 are all considered lost). Total shipment reliability is ~25%. Backend mu_hat must be set >728 to trigger any new orders.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15), the SKU continues to suffer from massive pipeline inaccuracies. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 744 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments: P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), and P17 (194), totaling 728 units of 'ghost inventory'. Only the P21 order (13 units) is realistically expected. To prevent the OR backend from calculating a near-zero order due to this false pipeline, I must set mu_hat (estimated demand) to a value that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock. Current seasonal demand for long-sleeved tops is low, averaging approximately 15 units per period over the last 6 weeks (14.67). A standard base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + Review=1) would be roughly 60-70 units. Therefore, I set an explicit mu_hat of 800 (728 ghost units + ~72 units of actual requirement) to force a small corrective order. L is set to 'explicit' 2 to reflect the promised lead time for the base calculation, while sigma_hat is kept conservative to avoid excessive holding costs on a low-demand summer item.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 728 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). Shipment loss rate is currently ~75%. Seasonal demand remains in a trough (avg ~15 units/period) consistent with summer for long-sleeve basics.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The product is a long-sleeved top, which is currently in a seasonal trough during the summer months (demand has averaged ~15 units over the last 5 periods). However, the primary challenge is severe supply chain instability. The pipeline currently shows 755 units in transit, but analysis of history confirms that 728 of these are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), and P17 (194). These orders are all at least 6 periods past their promised lead time. Only orders P18 (L=1) and P21 (L=2) have arrived recently. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine the order quantity, the presence of 728 ghost units prevents any new orders from being placed unless mu_hat is set to exceed this value. To counteract the backend's perception of 728 units in transit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 780. This value is calculated as (Ghost Inventory + Buffer for (L+1) demand), where 728 + (3 * 15) = 773. Rounded to 780, this forces an order that ignores the lost units. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the high variance in both demand and delivery success.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Women's Everyday Basics - Long-sleeved top) is currently in a seasonal trough (mid-summer), with recent demand averaging ~11 units/period (last 4 periods: 6, 18, 20, 13, 4). The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), and P17 (194) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 728 units. The backend OR engine sees these 728 units as in-transit, which prevents it from ordering new stock unless the base stock (mu_hat) exceeds this value. Currently, on-hand inventory is 39 units, which covers about 3-4 periods of demand at the current rate. To ensure the backend can place small maintenance orders or respond if demand picks up, I must maintain mu_hat at a level that offsets the 728 units of ghost inventory. I set mu_hat to 770 (728 ghost + ~40 units for 3-4 periods of demand). L is set to 2 (promised) to avoid excessive inflation from the capping logic, and sigma is set using recent_N to reflect lower summer volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Seasonal trough for long-sleeve basics confirmed (avg demand ~10-15). Total ghost inventory remains at 728 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). Shipment loss rate remains extremely high (>70%), necessitating continued mu_hat inflation to bypass pipeline errors.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is early August (2019/8/5), and this product is a long-sleeved top, which is entering its seasonal low point in Northern Hemisphere retail. Demand has stabilized at a low trough (average demand for the last 5 periods is ~10 units). The primary challenge continues to be the massive 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), and P17 (194) are all overdue by 8+ periods and are considered lost, totaling 728 ghost units. The backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent any new orders unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset this ghost inventory. I must set mu_hat above 728 plus the buffer for expected demand over total lead time (L+1). With an expected lead time of 2-3 periods and current demand of ~10/period, a base stock of ~770 is needed to maintain a small safety stock. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the distorted historical averages and the pipeline error.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total ghost inventory in pipeline remains 728 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). Seasonal demand for long-sleeved basics remains at a trough (avg ~10). Explicit mu_hat inflation >728 is required to bypass system-calculated pipeline inventory and trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/08/12, late summer. The product is a women's long-sleeved jersey top, currently in its seasonal demand trough (recent 5-period average demand is ~10-12 units). On-hand inventory is 42 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of current demand. However, there is a persistent 'ghost inventory' problem in the backend's pipeline calculation. The In-transit total of 735 units is dominated by lost shipments: P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), and P17 (194), totaling 728 units of lost cargo. The backend OR engine subtracts this pipeline from the base stock. To ensure the backend can place any future orders if needed (though none are strictly necessary this period for stock), mu_hat must be inflated to exceed this ghost inventory. I set mu_hat explicitly to 770 (ghost inventory 728 + buffer for 3 periods of demand) to keep the system 'ready' and bypass the pipeline error. Sigma_hat is set to a low explicit value reflecting the current stable low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Persistent ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 728 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). Historical seasonal demand trough for long-sleeved basics continues (avg ~11 units). Systematic inflation of mu_hat (>728) remains necessary to neutralize the backend's pipeline deduction and maintain the ability to order.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019-08-19), the SKU remains in a seasonal trough for long-sleeved basics, with recent demand averaging ~11 units (Periods 25-27: 10, 11, 11). The critical challenge is the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 741 units, but this includes P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), and P17 (194), totaling 728 units that are long overdue and confirmed lost. The actual reliable pipeline contains only the order from P24 (4 units) and P27 (6 units). To force the backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to exceed the ghost inventory plus the desired stock level for the current demand regime. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 780 units. This is calculated as: Ghost Inventory (728) + (Expected Lead Time 3 + Review Period 1) * Demand Forecast (13) + Safety Buffer. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to neutralize the 728 false units and maintain a small on-hand buffer. L is set to 3 to reflect the high volatility and recent lead time of 3 periods observed in Period 26.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August (2019-08-26). Historical demand for this 'Long-sleeved top' shows a seasonal trough during summer (avg ~11 units), but we expect an uptick as autumn approaches. However, the primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total In-transit is 755 units, of which 728 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P13, P17). These lost units have not arrived for 12+ periods but still reduce the actual orders computed by the OR backend (base stock - pipeline). To override this error, mu_hat must be set higher than the ghost inventory plus the desired safety stock. With current on-hand at 11 and recent demand averaging ~14, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 790. This value (790 - 728 ghost - 11 on-hand) aims to trigger a net order of approximately 50 units, which covers nearly 3-4 periods of demand at the expected upcoming autumn rate, providing a buffer against the high shipment loss rate (~70%). L is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the slightly more stable, albeit unreliable, lead times observed recently (avg ~2).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline ghost inventory remains at 728 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). Recent arrivals (P18, P21, P23) show a lead time range of 1-3 periods, but shipment reliability stays very low (~30% success rate). Seasonal demand is pivoting from summer trough (avg 11) to early autumn recovery (avg ~15-20).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, marking the start of the autumn retail season. Demand for 'Long-sleeved tops' is expected to recover from the summer trough (avg ~11) to a higher autumn baseline (estimated ~20-25 units). The pipeline currently shows 788 units in-transit, but 728 of these are 'ghost inventory' from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, 13, and 17 that are long overdue and confirmed lost. The actual reliable pipeline contains only 60 units (from P27, P28, P29). With 0 units on-hand and 11 lost sales last period, we urgently need to order. To bypass the backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat such that the base_stock exceeds 788. Based on an L=2 and a forecast of 25 units/period for the autumn recovery, the natural base stock would be ~75. Adding the 728 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 810 to force a meaningful replenishment order that accounts for both the demand shift and the corrupted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Autumn seasonal recovery confirmed: Demand increased from avg 11 to 20 over the last two periods (P28-P29). Pipeline ghost inventory remains at 728 units (P1, P3, P13, P17).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (2019/09/09), the product (Womens Long-sleeved top) is entering its autumn recovery phase. Demand over the last three periods (P28-P30) has averaged 18.7 units, up from the summer trough of ~11. Pipeline inventory is currently 798 units, but 728 units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost legacy orders (P1, P3, P13, P17). This means the effective physical pipeline is only 70 units (P29: 33 units, P30: 30 units, plus 7 units remaining from P24/others). To ensure the OR backend places an order and ignores the 728 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). I estimate the target base stock for the current demand regime (avg 20, L=2) to be approximately 85 units (including safety stock). Therefore, I set mu_hat to 85 + 728 = 813. I use L=3 to account for the recent lead time variance (P23 and P27 took 3 periods).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019-09-16), we are entering the mid-autumn season for long-sleeved tops. Demand has clearly spiked from a summer trough of ~11 units to an average of ~26 units over the last three periods (P29-P31: 19, 17, 41). The supply chain remains unreliable with a significant 'ghost inventory' of 728 units (P1, P3, P13, P17) which the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity. Current in-transit is 818, of which only 90 units (P29: 33, P30: 30, P31: 27) are 'real' and expected. I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to overcome the 728-unit pipeline error. To target an actual desired base stock of roughly 120 units (covering 4 periods at 30 units/period) while neutralizing the 728 units of ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat to 850. This ensures the backend calculates an order after subtracting the 818 total in-transit units. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for the recent demand volatility (17 to 41).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand surge confirmed: Demand for long-sleeved tops increased from ~11 to ~26 (+136%) between P28 and P31. Pipeline ghost inventory remains at 728 units, necessitating mu_hat > 750 to trigger orders.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The seasonal transition to autumn for 'Long-sleeved tops' is clearly visible, with demand spiking to 41 units in P31 and settling at 26 in P32, compared to the summer trough of ~11 units. The pipeline continues to be plagued by 728 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost batches in P1, P3, P13, and P17. To maintain a functional reorder cycle, I must set mu_hat at a level that exceeds this ghost inventory plus the required base stock for current demand. I estimate current demand mean at 30 units and volatility at 10. To cover a 2-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=3), the required real base stock is approximately 110-120 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to 850 (728 ghost + 122 target) to bypass the backend's pipeline deduction. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the current 1-3 period arrival window observed in recent successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: Autumn recovery trend: Demand transitioned from summer avg of 11 to autumn avg of ~30 (+172%) between P28 and P32. Pipeline ghost inventory remains at 728 units, necessitating mu_hat > 800 to ensure replenishment.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '316441001' (Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top) is currently experiencing a massive autumn demand surge as temperatures drop. Demand jumped from an average of ~20 in early September to 98 in Period 33 (+390% increase). This confirms a significant seasonal regime shift. However, the backend calculation is severely hindered by 728 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders P1, P3, P13, P17) that remain in the pipeline. With Period 33 concluded, in-transit is 843 units. If we subtract the 728 ghost units, the true reliable pipeline is 115 units (P29: 33, P32: 66, P33: 16). Given the surge, our base stock must be significantly higher than the sum of the ghost inventory and the expected demand. I will set mu_hat to 1250 to overcome the 728-unit pipeline error and cover an estimated demand of ~100+ units per period for the lead time (L+1=3). This should trigger an order of approximately 300-400 physical units to replenish the now-empty on-hand stock and rebuild a safety buffer for the high-demand autumn season.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Period 33 demand spiked to 98 units (+390% vs early Sept avg). Ghost inventory persists at 728 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation >1000 to maintain replenishment flow.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a 'Long-sleeved top', which is experiencing a significant autumn seasonal peak in October. Demand for the last two periods (P33, P34) was 98 and 93, a massive increase from the summer average of ~11 and the initial autumn recovery of ~30. Pipeline inventory currently stands at 1377 units, but this is severely distorted by 'ghost inventory' (lost orders totaling 728 units from P1, P3, P13, P17). Additionally, the order from P32 (66 units) is now at its promised lead time and should arrive in P35, but reliability is poor (~30%). I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to bypass the 728 units of confirmed lost inventory and the 93 units lost from P34's stockout. To maintain a net base stock that covers 3 periods (L+1) of peak demand (~100 units/period), I need a base stock around 1028 (728 ghost + 300 target). Setting mu_hat to 1050 with the explicit method ensures the backend places an order despite the falsified pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak confirmed: Demand sustained at >90 units for two consecutive periods (P33-P34), up from ~30 in late September. Total ghost inventory remains 728 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak autumn/winter season (October) for long-sleeved tops, with recent demand averaging ~89 units over the last 3 periods (P33-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 1311 units. However, 728 units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P13, P17). The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P33 (9 units), P34 (534 units), and any remaining logic from P32 (all arrived). This leaves an effective reliable pipeline of 543 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1311 units from its calculated base stock. To trigger an order that covers the next 3 periods (L+1) of high seasonal demand (estimated at 100-110 units/period), the mu_hat must be explicitly set to exceed the ghost inventory plus the desired stock level. Setting mu_hat to 1200 effectively signals a requirement for ~1200 units, which after subtracting the 1311 'In-transit' would normally result in no order. However, since the goal is to maintain a flow of stock despite the pipeline distortion, I am maintaining high explicit inflation. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect recent actual performance (P32 arrived in 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Autumn peak sustained: Demand averaged 88.6 units over P33-P35. Ghost inventory remains constant at 728 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). Shipment from P34 (534 units) is the primary reliable future arrival.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Women's Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top) is currently in its autumn peak season, with demand over the last four periods averaging 85.75 units. Despite this high demand, we are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory is heavily compromised by 728 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P1, P3, P13, and P17) which are long overdue and confirmed lost. There is a verified incoming shipment from P34 (534 units) which, if it follows the observed lead time of 2-3 periods, should arrive around P36-P37. However, it did not arrive in P36. To ensure the backend doesn't stop ordering due to the 728 ghost units and 534 in-transit units (total 1262 units in-transit), I must explicitly set mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment. Using an explicit mu_hat of 1350 (covering 3 periods of ~90 demand + 728 ghost + 350 safety) to ensure we bridge the seasonal peak and bypass the pipeline errors.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Autumn peak demand remains high (avg ~86). Pipeline ghost inventory remains at 728 units. Current in-transit total (1302) includes 534 units from P34 which are critical for peak coverage; if P34 does not arrive by P38, it may also be delayed/lost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the mid-autumn peak for long-sleeved tops, with demand consistently averaging ~82 units over the past five periods (P33-37). There is a significant mismatch between the system's 'In-transit' count (1392) and the 'live' pipeline. Verified 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) includes P1: 166, P3: 85, P13: 283, and P17: 194, totaling 728 units. Effectively, the OR backend subtracts 728 units from its base_stock calculation because it believes they are coming, preventing new orders. To counter this, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the desired base stock PLUS the 728 units of ghost inventory. Desired base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at ~85 units/period is roughly 255. Therefore, mu_hat must be at least 728 + 255 = 983. I will use 1050 to ensure a safety buffer and trigger an order of approximately 100-150 units, as P34 (534 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P34, current P38) and is at high risk of being lost or significantly delayed, leaving the on-hand inventory at zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total ghost inventory remains 728 units. Shipment from P34 (534 units) is now 4 periods old (promised 2) and has not arrived; if it does not arrive by P39, it will be added to the ghost inventory total (potential total 1262). Peak seasonal demand is sustained (~80-90 units).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for the long-sleeved jersey top is in a sustained autumn peak, averaging approximately 85 units over the last six periods (P33-P38). The pipeline inventory of 1302 units is severely compromised by 'ghost inventory' from lost or significantly overdue shipments: P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), and P17 (194), totaling 728 units. Crucially, the large order from P34 (534 units) is now 5 periods old (promised 2) and has not arrived; following the established pattern of shipments failing after 4+ periods of delay, I am now classifying P34 as likely lost. This brings the total ghost inventory to 1262 units (728 + 534). Since the backend OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (1302) from its base stock calculation, it currently believes the system is overstocked, even though there is 0 on-hand inventory during a peak demand season. To force the system to order and maintain service levels, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to exceed the internal ghost inventory count. I am setting mu_hat to 1600 (approx. 1262 ghost units + 4 periods of peak demand @ 85/period) to guarantee replenishment. Although recent successful arrivals show a lead time of 1-3 periods, the high loss rate necessitates an explicit L=3 to ensure the backend projects enough coverage.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Shipment from P34 (534 units) is now 5 periods overdue and classified as lost, increasing total pipeline ghost inventory to 1262 units. Peak seasonal demand (avg ~85) is sustained into November.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status is Period 40 (mid-November), within the peak seasonal demand period for 'long-sleeved tops' (Autumn/Winter). Demand is consistently high, averaging ~81 units over the last 7 periods (P33-P39). The primary challenge is the persistent 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Orders from P1, P3, P13, P17, and now P34 (534 units, 6 periods overdue) are definitively lost. Total ghost inventory is 1,262 units (166+85+283+194+534). With on-hand inventory at 0 and total in-transit at 1,617, the 'true' pipeline inventory is only 355 units (the P39 order). To force the backend to place an order despite the 1,262 units of false inventory, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the ghost inventory plus the desired stock level. I am targeting an explicit mu_hat of 1,650 to account for ghost units (1,262) and cover roughly 4 periods of peak demand (~340-400 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total ghost inventory increased to 1,262 units as P34 (534 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Shipment reliability remains critically low (<20% success rate by volume). Autumn/Winter peak demand (avg ~80-90) is sustained.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019-11-18), the SKU 316441001 (Women's Jersey Long-sleeved top) is in the peak of its Autumn/Winter demand cycle. Average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 83 units. Supply chain reliability remains a massive challenge; the pipeline is currently 1,688 units, but 1,262 of these are classified as 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 13, 17, and 34). This leaves only 426 units in the 'true' pipeline (315 units from P39 and 71 units from P40). To place an order, the OR backend's calculated base_stock must exceed the perceived pipeline of 1,688. I am explicitly setting mu_hat to 1,900 to ensure the backend recognizes the need for replenishment despite the bloated ghost inventory. L is set to explicit 2 (the promised lead time) as recent successful arrivals (P37) have returned closer to the promised window, although volatility remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for long-sleeved tops remains in its peak seasonal regime, with recent demand averaging around 75-80 units. The critical challenge is the persistent 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline consisting of lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P17, and P34), totaling 1,262 units. In Period 41, order P39 (315 units) successfully arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, leaving 244 units on hand. However, the backend OR engine still subtracts the 1,262 ghost units from its base stock calculation, which would prevent any new orders if the mu_hat were set to realistic demand levels. To bypass this, I continue to set an explicit mu_hat that exceeds the ghost inventory plus the required target inventory. With demand around 80 units and a target stock for (L+1)=3 periods being ~240 units, the desired base stock is approx 1,500. With 1,712 units technically in transit (according to the system), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger replenishment and maintain flow, especially as we approach the end of the year. I will maintain mu_hat at 1650 to ensure the small order of 71 units from P40 and the larger order from P41 are supplemented as they arrive, keeping the physical on-hand inventory healthy.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Order P39 arrived (L=2). Ghost inventory total remains at 1,262 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P34). Lead time for successful shipments fluctuates between 1-3 periods, but overall reliability is extremely poor (~20%).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for long-sleeved tops has intensified in late November (P42 demand: 182), significantly exceeding the previous autumn peak avg of 85. This likely represents a pre-holiday surge. Total in-transit inventory is 1712 units, but this is dominated by 1262 units of 'ghost inventory' (P1, P3, P13, P17, P34), which are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The backend OR engine incorrectly assumes this ghost inventory is coming, which prevents it from ordering. To force a new order to cover the current demand (avg ~120-150 expected) and replenish low on-hand stock (62), mu_hat must be set to a value higher than the ghost inventory plus the desired base stock. I am setting mu_hat to 1650 (approx 1262 ghost + 3 periods of 130 demand) to override the pipeline error. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for the high volatility seen in recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Significant demand spike confirmed in late November (P42: 182 units), suggesting a transition from autumn peak to holiday peak. Ghost inventory remains at 1262 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 (Women's Long-sleeved top) is currently in the December holiday peak. Recent demand shows a significant spike in late November (P42: 182 units) followed by a moderate week (P43: 42 units). We are entering the final weeks of the year where demand is historically high but volatile. The lead time for successful deliveries remains around 2-3 periods, but shipment reliability is extremely poor. The pipeline contains 1302 units, but based on the carry-over history, 1262 of these are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P13, P17, and P34). Only about 40 units in the current pipeline (from recent orders) might be real, though P40 and P41 just arrived in P43. To trigger new orders and bypass the 1262 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend deducts from the base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value greater than (Ghost Inventory + Safety Stock). Assuming a target base stock of ~1600 units (to cover 4 periods at an average of 100-150 units/period plus a buffer for the high loss rate), I set mu_hat explicitly to 1600. L is set to explicit 2 to reflect the average lead time of successful shipments, even though the risk of total loss remains high.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday peak volatility confirmed (P42 demand: 182). Total ghost inventory remains 1,262 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P34). Systematic mu_hat inflation >1262 remains mandatory to allow any new replenishment orders due to the backend's inability to recognize lost in-transit units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top' remains in the holiday peak regime, though it has slightly softened from the late November spike (P42: 182) to a more stable state (P43-44 avg: 44). However, as we approach late December, there is still risk of seasonal volatility. The primary constraint remains the massive pipeline 'ghost inventory.' Total in-transit is 1339, dominated by confirmed lost orders: P1 (166), P3 (85), P13 (283), P17 (194), and P34 (534), totaling 1262 units of ghost inventory. To trigger any replenishment order, the OR backend's base stock (mu_hat) must exceed this value. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1420, representing the 1262 ghost units plus approximately 3 periods of peak demand (3 * ~53) to ensure a small safety buffer for early January. Current on-hand (384) is sufficient for about 8 periods at current demand, but given the ~80% shipment loss rate, maintainable replenishment is the priority.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 1262 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P34). Shipment reliability measured by volume is ~15%. Holiday demand has stabilized at ~45 units/period following the late November spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 316441001 is a 'Womens Everyday Basics Long-sleeved top'. We are at Period 46 (Dec 23), in the middle of the winter holiday season. High demand peaked in late November (182 units) and has since stabilized around 45-60 units/period. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total 'in-transit' is 1339 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost: P1(166), P3(85), P13(283), P17(194), and P34(534). This results in a total ghost inventory of 1,262 units. The backend subtracts this 1,262 from its calculated base stock when deciding whether to order. To allow any new replenishment, mu_hat must be set to a value higher than this ghost inventory plus current on-hand (326). With demand averaging ~55 recently, a base stock targeting 3 periods of coverage (L+1) without ghost issues would be ~165; however, to overcome the 1,262 unit error, I must explicitly set mu_hat to 1350 to ensure the backend maintains a small ordering cushion as on-hand depletes during the post-holiday trough. I will use L=3 to reflect the actual upper-end lead time observed for successful arrivals (P40, P41).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 30, 2019. Demand for women's long-sleeved jersey tops has stabilized in a post-holiday range (averaging ~47 units over the last 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 288 units, which covers approximately 6 periods of current demand. However, the system's pipeline inventory is heavily compromised by 1,262 units of 'ghost inventory' (historical orders from P1, P3, P13, P17, and P34 that never arrived and are confirmed lost). Because the OR backend deducts this 1,262 units from its base stock calculation, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is set significantly above the ghost inventory level. Although current on-hand is sufficient for the immediate 2-period lead time, sustained inflation of mu_hat to 1450 (Ghost 1262 + ~180 for 4 periods of demand/safety stock) is required to maintain the backend's ability to respond to future demand shifts and ensure replenishment once on-hand is depleted. L=2 is used as recent successful arrivals (P39, P40, P41) show actual lead times of 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Current on-hand (288) is sufficient for ~6 periods. Pipeline remains filled with 1,262 units of ghost inventory (P1, P3, P13, P17, P34). System mu_hat must stay >1262 to bypass pipeline errors.
