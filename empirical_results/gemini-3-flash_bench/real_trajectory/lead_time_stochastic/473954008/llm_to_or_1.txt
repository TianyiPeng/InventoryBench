Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 473954008 (Womens Lingerie). Historical data shows a clear downward trend from early January (77 units) to early February (42 units). The mean of the provided 5 samples is approximately 48.8. Given the descending trend (77, 60, 50, 23, 42), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the more recent, lower demand levels (average ~38.3) to avoid over-ordering and high holding costs, which are equal to the profit ($1.0). The promised lead time is 2, so the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). L=default (2) is used as there is no historical lead time evidence yet.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a 2-pack of microfibre hipster briefs (Womens Lingerie). This is a basic/staple item with relatively steady demand, though the initial samples show a slight downward trend (77, 60, 50, 23, 42). In Period 1, we ordered 62 units, which are currently in-transit with a promised lead time of 2. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 50.4 units/week. Since the product description suggests a stable 'staple' item rather than a high-fashion seasonal piece, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most relevant demand levels without being overly influenced by the peak at the very start of the history. mu_hat will be based on the last 5 samples to provide a baseline for the OR backend's base-stock calculation. Given 'L' is promised as 2, the pipeline needs to cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019/02/25). The SKU is a 'Womens Lingerie' item. Historical samples show demand ranging from 23 to 77, with an average of approximately 50.8 over the five pre-game training samples. In Periods 1 and 2, demand was 53 and 69 respectively. Inventory is currently 0 with 131 units in transit (62 from P1 and 69 from P2). Promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the timing rule, the P1 order (ordered at P1 start) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase, which will only be visible in the P3 conclude message. Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in P2 conclude for the P1 order is normal. Demand is currently in a steady-to-moderate range (average of last 7 samples is ~55). I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent demand behavior while respecting the lead time of L=2 (meaning we cover demand for L+1=3 periods). Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the policy toward the median demand to minimize total cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The SKU 473954008 (Womens Lingerie) has been out of stock since the start of observation (Period 1), resulting in zero sales despite consistent demand. This is due to the promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible at the start of Period 4 (now). However, looking at 'Period 3 conclude', arrived=0. This confirms actual lead time >= 3 (1+L logic: an order from P1 is seen in P(1+L+1)). I expect the P1 order (62 units) to arrive during P4. Demand has been fluctuating (53, 69, 29) with historical samples showing values up to 77. The recent drop to 29 in Period 3 suggests some volatility. Because we have zero on-hand inventory and a pipeline of 143 units, I will maintain the base stock logic to cover the lead time. Given the high stockout cost (missed sales), I will set L to 3 (observed delay) and use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the current mean while accounting for the recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed to be at least 3 periods (Period 1 order did not arrive in Period 3 conclude).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Reviewing history: P2 order (69 units) arrived in P4, confirming an actual lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. The P1 order (62 units) is still missing (overdue), as it should have arrived in P3. This contributes to the high 'In-transit' count of 133 (62 from P1 + 12 from P3 + 59 from P4). If P1 is lost, the backend pipeline calculation will be inflated, causing it to under-order. Historical demand shows a downward trend: 77, 60, 50, 23, 42 (pre-game) and 53, 69, 29, 43 (in-game). The last 3 periods' mean is ~35. To compensate for the likely lost P1 shipment, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. calculation: (1+L)*35 = 3*35 = 105. I will add back the 62 units likely lost to the target base stock to ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 'ghost' in-transit units. Revised mu_hat = 105 + 62 = 167. L remains 2 (default).

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (62 units) appears lost; not arrived by P4 conclude (promised L=2). Lead time for P2 confirmed as 2 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is 'OP Cheeky hipster 2p' (Womens Lingerie). Historical demand samples show values of 77, 60, 50, 23, 42 (pre-game) and 53, 69, 29, 43, 45 (recorded periods). The mean demand across all 10 samples is approx 49.1. The Period 1 order (62 units) is officially considered lost as it did not arrive by P5 conclude, while the Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P3 (12), P4 (59), and P5 (8), totaling 79 relative to the 141 in-transit reported (which includes the lost P1 order and perhaps the pending P3 order). I will use the promised lead time L=2 for parameters. Given the lead time and review period, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (~147 units). mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the stable demand mean around 45-50. sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for this relatively low-margin/high-holding cost ratio (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (62 units) confirmed lost (missing 3 periods past promised delivery). Average demand stable around 47 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the environment shows extremely unstable lead times and lost shipments. The Period 1 order (62 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 2 order (L=2) arrived on time, but the Period 5 order arrived in only 1 period. Notably, the Period 3 order (ordered Feb 25, promised Mar 11) is now 2 periods overdue, and the Period 4 order (ordered Mar 4, promised Mar 18) is 1 period overdue. With 0 units on-hand and 136 units in-transit (many of which are likely lost or severely delayed), I must stabilize the OR backend's order logic. Historical demand mean is approximately 47.9 across 11 samples (pre-game + history). Recent demand (last 3 periods) has softened slightly but remains consistent with the product type (basic lingerie). However, since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend naturally tries to minimize inventory. Because the 'In-transit' count includes lost orders that the OR engine thinks are still coming, I will use an explicit L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand regime (avg ~43). Increasing sigma_hat via recent_N helps account for the supply-side volatility even though the demand itself is relatively stable.

Carry-over insight: Period 6/7: Significant supply chain instability. Period 1 lost. Period 3 and 4 orders now overdue (expected L=2). Period 5 order arrived early (L=1). Pipeline inventory calculations by the backend are likely inflated by lost/overdue units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The SKU '473954008' (Cheeky hipster briefs) has experienced significant supply chain distress. Analysis: 1) Lost Shipment: Period 1 order (62 units) is confirmed lost. 2) Overdue Shipments: Period 3 (12 units) and Period 4 (59 units) are now overdue by 3 and 2 periods respectively from their promised arrival dates. Period 6 (3 units) is still within the lead time window. 3) Pipeline Inflation: The OR backend sees 'In-transit: 136', but 62 of those are definitely lost and 71 (P3/P4) are highly suspect. If the backend uses 136 as pipeline inventory to subtract from the base stock, it will place an order of 0, prolonging the stockout. 4) Demand Forecast: Demand has been stable, with a mean of 45.4 units over the last 10 samples (including provided history), but currently the 'on-hand' is 0. 5) Inventory Strategy: To force the OR backend to order, I must increase the 'mu_hat' significantly to offset the 'In-transit' phantom inventory. I am setting L=2 (promised) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) * mean demand = 3 * 45 = 135 units. However, because 62 units are lost but still in the pipeline count, I will add them to the mu_hat (135 + 62 = 197) to trigger a replenishment order. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: P3 and P4 orders (71 units total) are now overdue, following the P1 lost shipment. Calculated pipeline inventory (136) is significantly inflated by these non-arriving units.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019/4/8). The supply chain remains highly unstable. Reviewing the history and in-transit units (194): P1 (62 units) is confirmed lost. P3 (12 units) and P4 (59 units) are now 4-5 periods past their order date (promised L=2) and are almost certainly lost or indefinitely delayed. Total likely lost = 133 units. The OR backend sees 'In-transit: 194', but effective pipeline is likely only 61 units (the order from P8). With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 61 (which might arrive in P10 or P11), we are stock-out prone. Demand avg is ~43 across the last 10 samples (including pre-game), but the recent 5 samples average ~33. Given the product (cheeky hipster briefs) and spring season, demand should be stable. To fix the 'lost order' inflation in the OR engine, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I need to cover (L+1) periods. Since L=2, I need to cover 3 periods of demand (~100-120 units). However, the backend subtracts the full 194 from its target. To force an order that compensates for the ~133 phantom units, I must set mu_hat high enough: Target Base Stock = Pipeline + Desired Order. If I want a 120-unit base stock, but the backend sees 194, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure the 'capped policy' allow a shipment. I will set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the volatility, mu_hat to explicit value 250 (to offset the 133 lost units and trigger a reorder), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to handle the demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Pipeline inventory remains heavily inflated by 133 lost/severely overdue units (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59). Effective pipeline is currently 61 units (from P8). Demand mean remains stable around 35-45 units/period.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/15. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'Womens Lingerie' (hipsters) remains stable but constrained by lack of stock, with an average demand of approximately 40 units/period (mean of last 9 periods is 40, mean of last 4 is 31.25). The primary issue remains supply chain reliability and pipeline inflation. The 'In-transit' figure is 250 units, but internal tracking reveals that 133 units are essentially lost or severely overdue (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59). Only 117 units (P8: 61, P9: 56) are likely to arrive. The OR backend uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide the current order. Since the backend thinks pipeline is 250 when it is effectively 117, it will under-order or order nothing. To force the backend to place an order that restores inventory to a target level for (L+1) periods (3 periods), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Targeting demand for 3 periods (~120 units) plus a buffer for volatility and the 'ghost' pipeline difference (250-117=133), I set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate a base stock target of ~270 to counteract the 250 in-transit block, ensuring a new order of ~20 units is triggered to maintain flow, assuming P8 might arrive soon.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 133 units (P1, P3, P4 orders) are confirmed lost/undeliverable. Effective pipeline is 117 units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019-04-22), demand for this lingerie item remains stable, averaging approximately 33 units/period over the last 5 weeks. A major challenge remains the 'In-transit' figure: the system shows 153 units, but 133 of these are from Period 1 (62), Period 3 (12), and Period 4 (59), which are now clearly lost or permanently delayed. The effective pipeline inventory is only 20 units (ordered in Period 10). With 89 units currently on-hand and an effective pipeline of 20, the total real inventory is 109 units. However, the OR backend sees 89 + 153 = 242 units. This massive inflation in pipeline inventory will cause the OR engine to place zero orders unless I adjust mu_hat or sigma_hat upward to compensate for the 'ghost' inventory. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (the standard observation) and use mu_hat 'explicit' to force a high enough base stock target to bypass the 133-unit pipeline artifact. I target a base stock of roughly 150 units ((L+1)*demand + buffer) to maintain availability despite the backend's miscalculation of pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Real pipeline vs system pipeline gap confirmed at 133 units (Lost orders P1, P3, P4). Effective pipeline is 20 units; system pipeline is 153 units.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (Apr 29, 2019), we are dealing with a significant discrepancy between the system's pipeline inventory and the actual effective pipeline. The system shows an 'In-transit' of 153 units, but 133 of these units (orders from P1: 62 units, P3: 12 units, and P4: 59 units) are lost or severely overdue and unlikely to arrive. The effective 'live' pipeline is only 20 units (the P10 order). The OR backend uses the formula: order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). With a system-reported pipeline of 153, the backend will severely under-order or not order at all unless we adjust parameters to compensate for the phantom inventory. Demand has been stable but slightly declining, moving from a mean of ~45 to ~35 over the last 10 periods (recent mean is ~28-30). To force the backend to place an order despite the 153 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 35 * 3 = 105) PLUS the 133 lost units, totaling 238. This 'inflation' of mu_hat ensures the backend's (mu_hat - pipeline) calculation results in a positive order volume that accounts for the lost stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits persistent reliability issues. Orders from Period 1 (62), Period 3 (12), and Period 4 (59) are logically considered lost as they are significantly past the promised lead time of 2. These 133 units remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (174 total), but are not physically arriving. The real effective pipeline consists only of the Period 10 order (20 units) and the Period 12 order (21 units), totaling 41 units. Demand is stable, averaging ~32 units over the last 5 periods. To compensate for the backend's inflated pipeline inventory (174) and ensure the OR engine actually places an order, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high. My target base stock is (L+1) * demand_forecast = 3 * 35 = 105. Since the backend subtracts pipeline (174) from base stock, I set mu_hat to 280 (approx target 105 + 174 inflated units) to force an order that covers immediate needs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 14. We have 7 units on-hand and 256 units in-transit. Based on historical data, we have a significant volume of lost or severely overdue shipments: Period 1 (62 units), Period 3 (12 units), Period 4 (59 units), and Period 10 (20 units), totaling 153 phantom units that inflate the backend's pipeline inventory. The true effective pipeline consists of orders from P12 (21 units) and P13 (82 units), totaling 103 units. Total effective inventory is 7 (on-hand) + 103 (reliable pipeline) = 110 units. Historical demand has stabilized lower, averaging roughly 28 units over the last 5 periods (P9-P13). With a lead time of 2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (~84 units). Since 110 > 84, no new order is technically needed. However, to bypass the backend's capped policy which sees an inflated pipeline of 256 units (preventing any orders), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the calculated base_stock is high enough if needed, though with the high in-transit count, the backend will likely order 0 regardless. I'll maintain L at 2 based on the most recent successful deliveries (P8 and P9).

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed lost/phantom pipeline inventory increased to 153 units (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59, P10: 20). Period 10 order now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Effective pipeline is only orders from P12 and P13.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 8. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 235 units. However, historical tracking confirms that orders from P1 (62), P3 (12), P4 (59), and now P10 (20) are lost or severely overdue, totaling 153 'phantom' units. The effective pipeline consists only of the P13 order (82 units), which reached its promised lead time (L=2) during Period 15 and should be visible in the next conclude message. Total demand for this SKU (Womens Lingerie) remains relatively stable, with an average of approximately 27 units/period over the last 5 periods. To correct the OR backend's order logic (which subtracts the inflated 235 pipeline units from its target), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I aim for a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 153 lost units to force an order that replenishes actual stock. Target Base Stock = (3 * 27) + 153 = 234. By setting mu_hat = 234 (with L=2), the backend calculates base_stock around 234. Since (234 - 235) is \u2264 0, I must set the target high enough to overcome the phantom pipeline. I will set mu_hat to 260 to ensure enough stock is ordered to cover current demand and the missing units.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Phantom pipeline inventory total verified at 153 units (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59, P10: 20). Recent demand mean (P10-P14) is 26 units/period, showing a slight downward trend from earlier periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019-05-27), the product (women's microfibre hipster briefs) shows a recent demand spike in Period 15 (70 units), potentially indicating the start of a summer seasonal period. The system's 'In-transit' count of 252 units is heavily inflated by 153 units of 'phantom pipeline' (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59, P10: 20) which have not arrived for many periods past their promised lead time. Additionally, the Period 13 order (82 units) is now one period past its promised lead time (3 periods since ordering) and hasn't arrived. Effective pipeline is likely only the P15 order (17 units). To correct for the 153 units the OR backend mistakenly believes are coming, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat as: ((L+1) * Expected Demand) + Phantom Pipeline = (3 * 35) + 153 = 105 + 153 = 258. This forces the backend to recognize the need for stock despite the 'ghost' inventory. I'm using L=2 as the baseline, as recent successful deliveries (P8, P9, P12) were 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Phantom pipeline inventory total remains at 153 units. Period 13 order (82 units) is now 3 periods late (placed P13, not in P15 conclude) and is potentially lost, though I will wait one more period to confirm.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (2019/6/3), the SKU 473954008 is experiencing stockouts due to high recent demand (Period 15: 70 units, Period 16: 72 units) and supply chain issues. The 'In-transit' figure of 258 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that have likely been lost or are extremely late. According to the history: P1 (62), P3 (12), P4 (59), and P10 (20) are definitely lost (total 153). Additionally, P13's order of 82 units is now 4 periods overdue (ordered Period 13, not in Period 16 conclude) and must also be treated as lost. This brings the total phantom inventory to 235 units. The only reliable units in transit are from P15 (17 units) and P16 (6 units), totaling 23. This creates a critical inventory gap. To force the OR backend's base-stock calculation to ignore the phantom inventory and generate an order that covers the recent demand surge (~70 units/period), I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat = (1+L) * 70 = 210 to reflects the current demand regime. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Phantom pipeline inventory total increased to 235 units (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59, P10: 20, P13: 82). Period 13 order is now 4 periods overdue and considered lost. Significant demand spike observed in P15-P16 (avg 71 units/period) compared to P10-P14 (avg 26 units/period).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: Current date June 10, 2019. We are observing a significant demand surge (P15-P17 avg: 73.3 units/period) compared to earlier stable periods (avg ~30-40). This appears to be a seasonal shift or a new higher demand regime. Supply chain stability remains extremely poor. The 'In-transit' quantity (235 units) is entirely composed of phantom/lost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 are all 4+ periods overdue). Real on-hand inventory is 0. To trigger a real order through the OR backend, which subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from its base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the necessary base stock to cover (L+1) periods of the current high demand (~75 units/period) PLUS the 235 units of phantom pipeline that the system will incorrectly subtract. Calculation: (1+L)*75 + 235 = (3*75) + 235 = 225 + 235 = 460. Setting mu_hat to 460 ensures the backend targets a stock level that accounts for the fact that current 'in-transit' units will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 15-17 average demand is 73 units, a 2.5x increase from previous months. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders) remains at 235 units.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (Period 19). We have a confirmed demand regime shift starting Period 15. The average demand for P15-P17 was 73.3 units, but Period 18 saw a slight cooling to 52 units. This aligns with a potential seasonal peak or promotion in late May/early June for lingerie. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this higher regime (avg ~68/period) while accounting for the small drop in P18. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: we have 235 'phantom' units in the pipeline (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59, P10: 20, P13: 82) that the system considers 'in-transit' but are lost. Total in-transit is 413, so the real pipeline is 413 - 235 = 178 units (all from the P18 order). Since the backend order logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to compensate for this 235-unit shortfall. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*68 + 235 = (3*68) + 235 = 439. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated pipeline. Expected L is 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Adjusted phantom pipeline inventory remains 235 units. Current demand regime (P15-P18) average is roughly 68 units/period, significantly higher than the spring average of ~25.

The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 66 units, a significant increase from the spring average of ~25 units. This shift likely corresponds to the start of the summer season. Supply chain stability remains poor; the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 261 units, but my tracking confirms 235 units are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59, P10: 20, P13: 82). The effective pipeline consists only of the P19 order (26 units). With 118 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 26, our real total stock is 144 units. At the current demand rate (~66 units/period), and a lead time of 2 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, roughly 198 units. To force the OR backend (which thinks we have 118 + 261 = 379 units) to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to offset the 235-unit phantom inventory. Current target inventory should be ~200 (demand cover) + 235 (phantom offset) = 435 units. I will set mu_hat to 435 to ensure the system maintains the necessary stock levels despite the pipeline corruption. Sigma_hat is set to cover the recent volatility observed during this demand spike.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), we are observing a significant demand regime shift that began around Period 15, likely representing a summer seasonal baseline for this 'Cheeky hipster' lingerie item. Demand from P15-P20 has averaged approximately 64.6 units per period, compared to the spring average of ~25 units. The supply chain remains unreliable. The 'In-transit' figure of 317 units is heavily inflated by 235 units of 'phantom' pipeline (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13). Subtracting these 235 units yields an effective pipeline of 82 units (orders from P19 and P20). With on-hand inventory at 60 and expected demand at ~65, the current stock covers only one period. To protect against the high risk of stockouts in this high-demand summer period, I am setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of the current demand regime. I use N=6 to capture the sustained higher demand from P15 onwards. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (recent arrivals were L=1 and L=2).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand summer regime (P15-P20) average is 64.6 units/period, 2.5x higher than the Feb-May average. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders) remains at 235 units.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-08. Demand analysis shows a sustained peak regime that started around mid-May (Period 15). The average demand for the last 7 periods (P15-P21) is 62.4 units per period, which is significantly higher than the earlier spring average of ~25-30. Recent demand (P18-P21) shows a slight stabilization around 54 units. I will use the last 7 samples to capture this summer regime. Regarding supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 317 is heavily inflated by 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014orders P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13 are confirmed lost/undeliverable, totaling 235 units. The effective 'In-transit' inventory is actually 82 units (P19: 26, P20: 56). The backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline', so I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this 235-unit phantom inventory. Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods should be 3 * 62.4 = 187. I will set mu_hat to 187 + 235 = 422 to force the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the lost units. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to reflect the recent volatility in the high-demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. We are in a high-demand summer regime for women's lingerie (Microfibre hipster briefs). The average demand from Period 15-22 is approximately 62.5 units/period, compared to the spring average of ~25. The system-reported In-transit inventory of 353 units is heavily inflated by 235 units of confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). The effective pipeline consists of the Period 19 order (26 units, likely arrived in P21/22 but not specifically detailed as separate from P20 order arrival) and the Period 22 order (92 units). More importantly, the system's internal base-stock calculation uses the inflated pipeline, which would result in zero orders. To force the OR engine to place an order that covers the high summer demand and ignores the phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a total inventory position (On-hand + Effective Pipeline) that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1 with L=2). Target = 65 units/period * 3 = 195 units. Since effective pipeline is 92 (P22) and on-hand is 6, I need an order of ~97. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 325 (which corresponds to 108 units/period for L=2), and given the phantom pipeline of 235, the backend calculation [Base Stock (325) - System Pipeline (353) + On-hand (6)] would still fail. Therefore, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 235 phantom units. I will set mu_hat to 550 to ensure a robust order is placed to sustain the summer peak despite the data corruption in the pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24 (2019/7/22), we are in the middle of a sustained high-demand summer regime. Since Period 15, the average weekly demand is approximately 63 units, significantly higher than the earlier spring mean. The pipeline inventory reported by the system (452 units) remains heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, and 13 totaling 235 units). Additionally, the system currently includes the Period 19 order (26 units) and Period 23 order (191 units) in transit. Subtracting the 235 lost units from the 452 in-transit total gives a 'real' pipeline of 217 units. My goal is to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory. To achieve this, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the volume of lost orders, effectively 'tricking' the base-stock calculation into ignoring the dead units. With L=2 (promised), I expect demand over 3 periods to be ~189 units. Adding the 235 lost units suggests a mu_hat around 424. sigma_hat is set to 50 for robust buffering during this high-volatility peak season.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders) remains 235 units. Summer demand regime remains strong (avg ~63 units since Period 15). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/29. We are in the middle of a sustained high-demand summer regime for this lingerie SKU (Microfibre hipster briefs). Demand since Period 15 has averaged approximately 63.8 units/period, compared to the spring average of ~25. The on-hand inventory is 0. The system 'In-transit' shows 452 units, but this is heavily inflated by 235 units of historical 'phantom' inventory (confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P13). Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 217 units (inclusive of the P19, P23, and P24 orders). To prevent the OR backend from severely under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will continue using 'explicit' L to shorten the lead time window and 'explicit' mu_hat. Since holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the service level target is 50%. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*64 covers the expected demand. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher volatility of the summer regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 26. The product is a women's microfibre hipster brief, experiencing a sustained summer demand regime. Historical demand since Period 15 has averaged ~63 units, but recent weeks show higher volatility (ranging from 47 to 85). Period 25 conclude shows 0 units arrived and 0 ending inventory, with 47 unmet demand. The system 'In-transit' shows 452 units, but my 'Carry-over Insights' track 235 units as definitively lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Recently, the order from P23 (191 units) is now 3 periods out (placed P23, not arrived in P24 or P25 conclude). If it arrived in P26, it would be a lead time of 3. However, given the high in-transit number (452 - 235 lost = 217 real in-transit), and since total real in-transit (217) exceeds the base stock needs for ~3 periods (~195 units), the capped OR policy might prevent a new order if I don't adjust metrics. I will set mu_hat to reflect the summer average (64 units * 3 periods) and sigma_hat to handle the high variance. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (ranging 1-2 periods), but the OR engine's 'cap' remains a risk if it overestimates pipeline health.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains at 235 units. Period 23 order (191 units) has not yet arrived (promised L=2), and is now 3 periods into its cycle; if missing next period, it will be flagged as potentially lost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (2019/08/12), we observe that the major order from Period 23 (191 units) finally arrived in Period 26 with an actual lead time of 3 periods (promised 2). This successfully replenished on-hand inventory to 157 units. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 261, but my carry-over analysis from Period 26 identifies 235 of these as 'phantom' units (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Thus, the effective pipeline is only 26 units (from Period 19, which likely already arrived but is being tracked against subsequent orders, or is a small residual). Looking at demand, the summer peak (P15-P24 avg ~63) appears to be cooling off; P25 was 47 and P26 was 34. Given the large on-hand stock (157 units) and declining demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5 covers P22-P26: avg ~53) to reflect this cooling trend while ensuring L is set to explicit=3 to account for the recent delivery delays. This high L value increases the base stock target, but because 'In-transit' is inflated by 235 units, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will likely result in a 0 or very small order, which is desired given our current overstock versus expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Confirmed actual lead time for large P23 order was 3 periods. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13) remains 235 units. Demand cooling from summer peak: last 2 weeks (34, 47) lower than previous 10-week average (~65).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28 (mid-August), the product (women's lingerie) continues to show signs of cooling demand following the summer peak (vols dropping from ~65 down to ~35 recently). The system's 'In-transit' figure of 261 is heavily inflated by 235 units from confirmed lost/phantom orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). Subtracting these reveals an effective pipeline of 26 units. On-hand inventory is healthy at 121 units due to the arrival of the large P23 order. However, given that demand is slowing down and holding costs ($1.0) equal profits ($1.0), maintaining excess inventory is risky. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 12 samples (covering the summer peak and the current cooling trend) to capture a safe but not excessive demand buffer. Since actual lead times have stabilized around 2-3 periods despite the volatility, I set L=2 (promised) while mu_hat reflects the higher-intensity summer average to prevent stockouts if demand resists further cooling.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed cooling trend: Demand dropped from summer avg ~65 to avg 39 over the last 4 periods. Phantom pipeline remains at 235 units.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 26, 2019. We have observed a cooling trend in demand following the summer peak (avg ~65), with the last four periods averaging 41.75 units (34, 36, 60, and 47 in P25). The phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains at 235 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13). The 'In-transit' figure is 261, of which only 26 units (from P19) are potentially real, though even the P19 order is now extremely overdue (10 periods), suggesting it is also lost. The effective pipeline is likely zero. However, we have 61 units on hand. I will use the recent_N method (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the cooling demand regime (~41.75/unit) and L=2. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent period, the OR backend will calculate a base stock. Because the 'In-transit' (261) + 'On-hand' (61) = 322 is far higher than the needed base stock for a demand of ~42, the backend will likely order 0. This is the correct behavior to allow the 61 on-hand units to deplete while we wait for the system to reconcile the 'lost' units.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Verified total phantom/lost pipeline inventory is at least 235 units. Period 19 order (26 units) is now 10 periods overdue and also likely lost, bringing probable phantom total to 261 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower post-summer level, avg ~42 units over the last 4 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Product 473954008 is currently in a post-summer transition. After a high-demand summer peak (Period 15-24 avg ~65), demand has cooled, but remains somewhat volatile with recent values of 60 and 70 in Periods 28 and 29. The current demand mean over the last 5 periods is approximately 49.4 units. The primary challenge is the significant 'phantom pipeline' of 261 units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and now P19). This inflated in-transit figure prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders because it believes stock is coming. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to a high 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom pipeline plus the desired base stock. With demand around 50/unit and L=2, a normal base stock (L+1) would be ~150. Given the 261 units of phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat to 450. This forces the OR backend to see a requirement (450 - 261 = 189) which will trigger a net order to replenish the currently empty on-hand stock and cover near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory is 261 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Current demand has stabilized at a moderate level (avg ~49 units over last 5 periods) following the summer peak.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand has transitioned from the high-summer peak (avg ~65) to a more moderate post-summer regime, averaging 55.4 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30). Lead times remain volatile (ranging 1-3 periods), but the promised 2 periods remains a fair baseline. The primary challenge is the persistent 'phantom inventory' in the system-calculated pipeline. The system shows 437 units in transit, but 261 of those are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). The effective pipeline is actually 176 units (from P30). To align the backend's base-stock calculation with reality, I must compensate for the 261 missing units by setting mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a base stock requirement for (L+1)=3 periods. With a mean of ~55, the required base stock is ~165 plus safety stock. Due to the backend's policy [order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)], the system sees pipeline=437, which is far above any reasonable base stock, and would normally result in a zero order. To force a corrective order that considers only the 176 effective units, I set mu_hat to a level that accounts for the phantom gap: mu_hat = (Expected Base Stock) + (Phantom Units). Targeted Base Stock is ~230 (incorporating safety for moderate volatility). Adding 261 phantom units suggests a dummy mu_hat near 490.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (Sep) is established at an average of 55 units/period. Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders) remains 261 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32 (2019-09-16), the product is in a post-summer demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) has averaged 54.6 units/period, which is slightly lower than the summer peak but higher than the spring floor. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 491 units. However, as documented in Carry-Over Insights, 261 of these units are confirmed lost or severely overdue (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19). The effective pipeline consists of the P30 order (176 units) and the P31 order (54 units), totaling 230 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline (230) covers roughly 4.2 periods of current demand (at ~55 units/week), and promised lead time is 2, the pipeline is healthy. I will set mu_hat using the recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the current regime more accurately than a long-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) is kept at 'calculate', which remains effective despite the phantom shipments as long as recent arrivals (like P23) are factored in.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 473954008 is currently in a post-summer demand regime (September). Demand over the last 6 periods (P27-P32) has averaged 52.3 units/period, showing relative stability compared to the volatile summer peak. On-hand inventory is 189 units. A critical factor is the 'In-transit' figure of 261 units, which consists entirely of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19) as identified in previous periods. The OR backend subtracts this 'phantom' pipeline from the base stock calculation, which would prevent any new orders from being placed. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. My target base stock is (L+1) * demand_avg = 3 * 55 = 165 units, but to get the system to actually order later when needed or maintain safety, I must offset the 261 lost units. However, current on-hand (189) is already above the target base stock of 165, so no order is necessary this period regardless of the phantom inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to reflect the steady post-summer demand (~52/period) and 'calculate' for lead time as the recent arrivals (P30, P31) was 1-2 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30, 2019), the inventory position is 110 units on-hand. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 261 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is zero. Recent demand (P28-P33) has averaged 59.5 units per period, which is slightly higher than the early September average of 55 units but lower than the summer peak (~65). In Period 32, a large arrival of 230 units (from P30 and P31) replenished stock. With 110 units on-hand and 0 effective units in-transit, I need to ensure we cover demand for the next L+1 periods (approximately 3 periods). Total demand over 3 periods at 60 units/period is 180 units. Since 110 < 180, an order should be triggered. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 261 units in-transit and blocking the order, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that forces a base stock high enough to overcome the 261 phantom units. Required base stock = 180 (needs) + 261 (phantom) = 441. I will set mu_hat to 450 to ensure a safety margin and trigger a replenishment order of approximately 70-80 units.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a summer peak (avg ~65) to a stable post-summer regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 58.8 units/period, showing some moderate volatility (range 41-79). The system shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 340 units, but historical evidence confirms a significant 'phantom pipeline' of lost orders. Specifically, orders from P1 (62), P3 (12), P4 (59), P10 (20), P13 (82), and P19 (26) are considered lost, totaling 261 units. Subtracting these from the 340 units in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 79 units (the order placed in P34). Given On-hand inventory is 63, the total effective position is 142 units. With a promised lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for 3 periods (current + lead time). Using a recent average demand of ~58 units/period, the required base stock is approximately 174 units. To handle this in the OR backend while accounting for the 261-unit phantom pipeline inflation, I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L to the promised 2. I set mu_hat to 175 (covering 3 periods at ~58/period). I set sigma_hat to 45 (approx 26 per period * sqrt(3)) to maintain a high service level given the volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand for this Womens Lingerie item has stabilized in a post-summer regime, with an average of approximately 55 units over the last 6 periods (P30-P35). However, there is a massive discrepancy between the system's 'In-transit' quantity (340) and the effective pipeline. Historical analysis identifies 261 units as 'phantom' or lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Thus, the effective pipeline is only 79 units (from P34). With on-hand inventory at 11, the system believes the inventory position is 11 + 340 = 351, whereas the actual position is 11 + 79 = 90. To force an order that covers 3 periods of demand (approx 165 units) while the backend subtracts the inflated 340, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that offsets this phantom inventory. Calculation: Target Position (165) + Phantom Inventory (261) = 426. Setting mu_hat to 426 ensures the backend sees (426 - 351) as the gap needing to be filled, adjusted by the internal cap logic. L is kept at 2 as recent lead times have been 1-2 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 0 following a demand of 58 in Period 36. The In-transit (pipeline) is reported as 415 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 261 of these units are confirmed lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, and P19). Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is 415 - 261 = 154 units. These effective units consist of the orders from P34 (79) and P36 (75). Neither has arrived yet; P34 is currently 3 periods into its cycle (placed P34, not in P36 conclude), meaning it should arrive in the upcoming Period 37 resolution or is slightly delayed. Demand has been stable since Period 30, with an average of approximately 55 units per period (P30-P36: 56, 51, 41, 79, 47, 52, 58). I will set mu_hat to reflect this current regime (N=7) and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent volatility. Note: Because the backend uses the 'In-transit' figure of 415 and the stock-out is imminent, the capped policy will likely result in a 0 order if I use default L; however, setting L=2 (promised) and adjusting parameters to cover the expected demand while 'ignoring' phantom stock is the objective. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the stable post-summer average.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/28. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has increased from a post-summer average of 55 to a recent average of 65.8 over the last 5 periods (P33-P37). System 'In-transit' is 415 units, but 261 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). This means the effective pipeline is only 154 units (P34 order of 79 and P36 order of 75). Actual lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, though 2 remains the promised benchmark. To ensure availability given the current demand trend (~66 units/period) and the stockout situation, I'm setting mu_hat using the most recent 5-period average (66) multiplied by (1+L=3), totaling 198. Sigma_hat is set to capture recent volatility. By setting L to 2 (default) while mu_hat reflects the higher recent demand, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that should trigger an order to cover the gap between the effective pipeline (154) and the target level, accounting for the 0 on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase in late October: average demand P33-P37 is 65.8 units/period, compared to the September average of 55 (+20%). Phantom pipeline inventory remains verified at 261 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/04. We are entering the pre-holiday season for lingerie. Historical demand from Period 33-38 shows a sustained upward trend with an average of 66.3 units/period, compared to the September average of 55. Recent periods (P37-P38) saw very high demand (93, 69) which resulted in stockouts. The backend 'In-transit' figure is 415, but 261 of these units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). The real pipeline consists of P34 (79 units) and P36 (75 units), totaling 154 units. Both are now overdue (P34 is 4 periods old, P36 is 2 periods old). Since no arrivals occurred in P37 or P38 concludes, we are currently at 0 on-hand. To account for the 'phantom' inventory in the OR engine, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. I estimate demand for the (L+1) window (3 periods) at ~70 units/period, but must increase the target to 471 (target base stock) + 261 (phantom offset) = 732. However, the cap will likely restrict this. I will set mu_hat to 210 (70 * 3) and use an explicit L to signal the current delays.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), we are approaching the holiday shopping season for lingerie. Current on-hand inventory is low (21 units) and demand has trended upward over the last 7 periods (P33-P39) to an average of 64.5 units/period. The pipeline inventory (385 units) remains significantly inflated by 261 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19), meaning the effective in-transit quantity is only 124 units (orders from P34, P36 were accounted for, leaving P39's order of 45 units plus potentially late orders). However, recent arrivals (P36 arriving in P39) suggest actual lead times are drifting towards 3 periods. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the seasonal demand and offset the 261-unit deficit created by the OR engine's 'overestimate' of the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the required base stock for (L+1)=4 periods at the current demand rate (~65 * 4 = 260) and then add the 261 phantom units to trigger an order that fills the real-world gap, resulting in a mu_hat of ~521.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed lead time drift (P36 arrived in 3 periods). Effective pipeline is system-in-transit (385) minus phantom inventory (261) = 124 units. Demand remains stable in the mid-60s heading into November.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/18. Demand has been fluctuating in the 50-70 range but dropped to 32 in the most recent period. However, given the product (women's lingerie) and the upcoming holiday season (late November/December), demand is expected to remain stable or increase. The most critical issue is the 'pipeline inflation' caused by 261 units of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). The system shows 499 units in-transit, but the 'effective' pipeline is actually 238 units (499 - 261). These effective units are from P34 (79), P39 (45), and P40 (114). Note that P34 is now significantly overdue (7 periods since order), but I will not yet categorize it as fully lost as it represents a large chunk of inventory needed for the current stockout. To bridge the gap between the system's inflated pipeline and reality, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I'll target a base stock covering 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at a forecasted demand of 65 units/period = 195 units. To account for the 261 'ghost' units the OR engine thinks we have, I set mu_hat to 195 + 261 = 456. This forcing function ensures a positive order is generated despite the phantom inventory. I'll maintain 'calculate' for L and 'default' for sigma to allow for standard volatility handling.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Verified phantom pipeline inventory remains 261 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Period 34 order (79 units) is now 5 periods overdue and potentially lost/delayed; monitoring closely.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42 (Nov 25), demand is cooling slightly from the late October peak (avg ~40 recently vs ~65 in late Oct). The most critical issue is the 'phantom pipeline' inventory. Currently, the system shows 454 units in transit. However, based on history, 261 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19). Additionally, Period 34 (79 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is certainly lost. This brings the total phantom inventory to 340 units. The effective pipeline consists only of P40 (114 units). With 13 units on hand, the effective inventory position is 127 units. At a current demand rate of ~45-50 units/period, we need to cover (L+1) periods. Using L=3 (accounting for recent drift) and a mean of 50, the base stock target should be ~200. Since effective inventory (127) is below this, an order is needed. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory by 'tricking' the backend: since the backend subtraction (Base Stock - Pipeline) will subtract 454, but only 114 exists, I must add the 340 phantom units back into the mu_hat calculation or use an explicit value to force the order. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=9, covering the Nov/Oct period) and explicit L=3 to ensure robust coverage during lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory confirmed at 340 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19 and now P34). P34 (79 units) is 8 periods overdue and transitioned from 'delayed' to 'lost'. Effective pipeline is only P40 (114 units).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43 (Dec 2, 2019), the context is the late Autumn/Pre-Holiday season. The demand regime has fluctuated but recently stabilized: demand in P40-P42 averaged 40.7 units/period, while the Nov/late-Oct average (P38-P42) was 49 units. We must account for the persistent Supply Chain issues: there is a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 340 units (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and P34) that the backend believes is coming but is actually lost. System in-transit is 527; effective pipeline is 527 - 340 = 187 units (from P40 and P42). With a target base stock needed for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods), and expected demand around 55-65 units/period for December, the system needs to maintain ~180-200 units. To compensate for the 340 phantom units and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects (1+L)*forecast + phantom_offset. Forecast (1+L)*60 = 180 + 340 = 520. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value to account for recent lead-time volatility (3-period arrivals) and potential holiday demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 340 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P34). Current effective pipeline is 187 units. December demand is projected to be slightly higher than November lows, targeting ~60 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand has softened recently (average of 38 units over the last 4 periods), likely due to post-November sales cooling, even though lingerie often sees a late December spike. The primary issue remains inventory reporting. The system reports 413 units in transit. However, I have identified 340 units as 'phantom' or lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and P34). The P40 order of 114 units arrived in Period 43 (3 periods lead time), and the P42 order (73 units) is the only valid shipment remaining in-transit. Therefore, the true effective pipeline is 73 units, not 413. The system's 'on-hand' is 90. Total effective position: 90 (on-hand) + 73 (true in-transit) = 163. Using the backend formula, the base stock (target inventory) for a 3-period window (L=2+1) with a mean of 55 and std dev of ~18 is approximately 220. However, the backend sees the 340 phantom units, so it will calculate inventory as 90 + 340 + 73 = 503, which is well above the target, leading it to order 0. To force an order, I must increase mu_hat significantly to offset the 340 phantom units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (163 - 340 + desired_order) scaled appropriately, or simply provide a high mu_hat to ensure we start rebuilding stock for the holiday/year-end period given current low on-hand (90) and expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Verified phantom pipeline inventory remains 340 units. Effective pipeline consists only of the P42 order (73 units). Recent demand (last 4 periods) has slowed to an average of 38 units/period, but a year-end/holiday uptick is anticipated.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45 (2019/12/16), we are entering the final stages of the year. The current inventory status shows 51 units on hand and 460 units in transit. However, historical reconciliation (Carry-over insights) confirms that 340 units of the 'in-transit' inventory are lost (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and P34). The actual effective pipeline consists only of orders from P42 (73 units) and P44 (47 units), totaling 120 units. Demand over the last 4 periods has averaged ~38 units/period, but higher holiday-driven demand is expected. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the 340-unit 'phantom' pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating target base stock (S): With L=2 (Review+L=3), and targeting coverage for 3 periods of demand at ~60 units/period (considering late Dec/early Jan), S should be ~180. The OR backend uses the logic: Order = S - Pipeline. To offset the 340-unit phantom inflation, I must set the explicit mu_hat such that 'base_stock - (Actual Pipeline + 340)' results in the desired order. To get ~60 units ordered: 180 = mu_hat - (120 + 340) => mu_hat = 640. Setting mu_hat to 640 and sigma_hat explicitly to capture holiday volatility (~25 units/period * sqrt(3) \u2248 43).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46 (Dec 23), we are in the peak holiday/year-end season for women's lingerie. Demand in the most recent period (P45) spiked to 74 units, up from the previous 4-period average of 38, confirming a seasonal uptick. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect this holiday demand, forecasting 65 units per period across the (L+1) horizon. Phantom pipeline inventory remains a critical concern: the current 'In-transit' figure of 516 units is heavily inflated. My verified phantom total is 340 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, P34). Additionally, the P44 order (47 units) is still in the 2-period window, and the P45 order (129 units) was just placed. Subtracting 340 from 516 leaves an effective pipeline of 176 units (47 + 129), which align with recent orders. I will use L=explicit=3 because the last three major arrivals (P36, P40, P42) all arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting a sustained supply chain slowdown during the Q4 peak. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to handle the high volatility (74 vs 39) observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Lead time for the last three concluded orders (P36, P40, P42) has consistently been 3 periods, indicating a seasonal or structural drift from the promised L=2.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 47 (Dec 30), we are managing a holiday/new-year transition. The 'phantom' pipeline inventory remains at 340 units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P19, and P34), which are considered lost or non-deliverable. The total system in-transit is 516, which means the functional pipeline is 176 units (orders from P44: 47 units and P45: 129 units). The lead time has structurally drifted to 3 periods (observed in P36, P40, P42 arrivals). Demand over the last three weeks (P44-P46) has averaged 57.6 units, showing a slight increase from late-November lows, likely holiday-driven. I will set mu_hat to capture this recent average over 20 periods (N=20) to smooth out the transition from autumn to holiday demand, and use sigma_hat for 20 periods to account for volatility. L is set to explicit '3' to match observed reality rather than the promised '2'.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains at 340 units (P1: 62, P3: 12, P4: 59, P10: 20, P13: 82, P19: 26, P34: 79). Effective pipeline is system in-transit minus 340.
