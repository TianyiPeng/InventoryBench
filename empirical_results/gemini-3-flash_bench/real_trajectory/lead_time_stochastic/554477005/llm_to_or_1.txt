Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS'. The historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4) shows samples: 20, 26, 22, 27, 15. The mean of these 5 samples is 20.0, with a standard deviation of 4.85. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The product is a lightweight viscose trouser, which is likely transitioning into spring demand but currently shows stable, relatively low volume. Since we have no inventory on-hand or in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all 5 historical samples to calculate mean and standard deviation for the backend compute. This is appropriate as the sample set is small and no significant regime shift is yet evident.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a lightweight trouser from the 'Divided' collection (typically youth-oriented and fast-fashion). Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows a mean of approximately 20.8 units per week (samples: 20, 26, 22, 27, 15). In Period 1, demand was 19 units, but we sold 0 because on-hand inventory was 0. We currently have 30 units in-transit (ordered in P1). The promised lead time is 2, so these are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of P4). Given the current stockout and the lead-time delay, we need to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to ensure we can meet demand when stock arrives. I will use the baseline demand of ~21 units/week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The SKU 554477005 (viscose pull-on trousers) is entering a spring seasonal window. Historical demand samples (Early Jan to early Feb) averaged ~20 units/period. However, in the last two periods (late Feb), demand has spiked significantly (19 in P1, 41 in P2), suggesting a shift into a higher demand regime as spring approaches. Currently, on-hand is 0 because orders placed in P1 and P2 (30 units each) have not arrived yet. With a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (including the 3 historical samples and 2 live samples) to capture this upward trend while maintaining some stability. For L, I 'calculate' based on history, though no arrivals have concluded yet. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the increased volatility seen in the transition from winter to spring.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand increased from ~20 (Jan) to 41 (late Feb), likely seasonal for spring apparel.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU '554477005' is 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS', a lightweight viscose trouser from the Divided collection, which is highly seasonal for Spring. Historical demand transitioned from a mean of ~21 in January to a stable, higher regime of ~41 in February (Periods 2 and 3). Current inventory is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have lost all potential sales so far due to lead time. Promised lead time is 2 periods. We ordered in P1, P2, and P3. According to the timing rules, the P1 order (30 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in this Period 4 start. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for this observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer window (L+1=4 periods). For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the higher February demand regime (avg ~34 across P1-P3, but P2-P3 were both 41) while buffering for the seasonal uptick.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds 2 periods; P1 order (ordered 2019/2/11) not arrived by P3 conclude (2019/2/25). Expecting L=3.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/11. Demand context: The product is 'Ankle-length trousers in an airy viscose weave', which aligns with a spring seasonal pickup noticed in Period 2/3 (demand ~41). Period 4 saw a slight dip to 27, but the overall mean since mid-February is approximately 36.3. Inventory: On-hand is low (3) due to delayed arrivals. Looking at lead times: The Period 2 order (30 units) arrived in Period 4 (L=2), but the Period 1 order (30 units) is still missing (it should have arrived in Period 3 if L=2 or Period 4 if L=3). This suggests the Period 1 shipment might be lost. If Period 3's order follows L=2, it arrives this period (P5). Setting L to 'calculate' to let the backend use observed data, but choosing N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher spring volume (averaging ~36 per period) and avoid being overly influenced by the lower Jan/early Feb baseline. Safety stock (sigma_hat) will also use the last 3 periods to account for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lost shipment for Period 1 order (ordered 2019/2/11, not arrived by P4 conclude).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), we are managing a seasonal trouser SKU. The demand surged in late Feb (~41 units/week) and has settled into a higher regime (avg ~33 in March) compared to Jan (~20). The Period 1 order (ordered 2019/2/11) is now 3 periods past the promised lead time of 2 and has not arrived, confirming it is likely a lost shipment. However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. The current inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and the pipeline contains 130 units (from P1, P3, P4, P5 minus the lost order). Excluding the likely lost P1 order (30 units), the effective pipeline is 100. Demand is high (mean ~31 over the last 5 periods), and volatility has increased. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher seasonal regime and set L=2 as the 'default' as the P2 order suggests the logistics chain is functional despite the P1 loss. Setting mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) results in (1+2)*31=93 for the OR backend, helping to maintain stock levels for spring demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Period 1 shipment (30 units) is lost (5 periods elapsed, L=2 promised). Demand regime stabilized at a higher seasonal mean of ~31 units/week (Periods 1-5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019-03-25). The product is a seasonal spring trouser. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the initial January samples, with the last 6 periods averaging ~32.6 units (19, 41, 41, 27, 32, 36). The Period 1 order (30 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 2 order (30 units) arrived in P4 (L=2). The Period 5 order (3 units) arrived in P6 (L=1). The Period 3 (42 units) and Period 4 (55 units) orders are still in transit (97 units total). Current on-hand is 0. Although one order arrived in 1 period, the promised lead time is 2, and we've seen variability. To prevent stockouts during this spring peak, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time. I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current demand regime (approx 32.6/week). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time variability: L=2 for P2 order, L=1 for P5 order. Average L \u2248 1.5. Lost shipment P1 (30 units) remains missing.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/04/01. The SKU is an 'airy viscose weave' trouser, highly seasonal for Spring. Historical demand has shifted upward significantly: Periods 1-4 averaged ~32 units, but Period 7 saw a spike to 53. Including pre-game data (Feb 4: 15), the demand is clearly trending up as weather warms. Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0, and sales have been lost in P5, P6, and P7 due to stockouts. The Period 1 order (30 units) is confirmed lost. Pipeline inventory (127 units) consists of orders from P3 (42) and P4 (55), plus some residual in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages: P2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4), P5 order arrived in 1 period (P6). Using 'calculate' for Lead Time (L) to reflect this volatility (Avg ~1.5, promised 2). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher Spring demand regime (avg ~38 units/period excluding the lost P1 period) while the OR backend scales it by (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: Period 7 demand (53) is 65% higher than the Period 1-5 average (32), consistent with Spring seasonality for lightweight trousers.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/8 (Spring). The SKU is 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS', described as 'ankle-length trousers in an airy viscose weave', which is a high-demand seasonal item for Spring/Summer. Historical demand shows a significant acceleration: P6 (36), P7 (53), P8 (85). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite 142 units in-transit, we are consistently stocking out due to the sharp demand spike. The last two demand points (53, 85) indicate a new regime far exceeding the previous mean of ~32. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for this momentum, forecasting an average weekly demand of 90 units for the next (L+1) periods to avoid further lost sales. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture this increased volatility. Lead time (L) has varied (1-2 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. Note: The P1 order remains lost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Extreme acceleration in late March/early April (P7: 53, P8: 85) driven by Spring seasonality for lightweight trousers, significantly exceeding the Feb/early March avg of 32.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' is an airy viscose trouser, which is highly seasonal for the current mid-April date (Spring). We are observing a significant demand surge: demand in the last three periods (P7-P9) averaged 71.6 units, compared to the early-season average (P1-P5) of 32 units. Specifically, Period 8 saw demand of 85 units and Period 9 saw 77 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline has 146 units pending (excluding the 127 units placed earlier that never arrived/concluded). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend needs to target a high service level. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect the recent surge (average of 71.6 demand units * (1+L)), and L=2 based on promised lead time (as recent observations P4 and P6 showed 1-2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at high-seasonal peak: Avg demand for last 3 periods (P7-P9) is 71.6 units, a ~120% increase over the Feb/Mar baseline. In-transit reconciliation: P1 shipment (30), P3 (42), and P4 (55) remain missing after 5+ periods; these should be treated as lost to ensure the OR logic places sufficient new orders.

Current date is 2019/4/22. Demand is in a high-growth seasonal phase (Spring trousers/airy viscose weave). Demand has increased significantly: P7 (53), P8 (85), P9 (77), P10 (129). The last 4 periods average 86 units. Lead times have been variable (L=1 or L=2). I am utilizing the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat to capture this recent spike while maintaining some stability. For lead time, I'll use the promised value of 2 as the baseline (L=2). Regarding in-transit inventory (127 units), I am strictly excluding the shipments from P1 (30), P3 (42), and P4 (55) which are now definitively lost (5-9 periods old). The OR backend includes current 'In-transit' in its logic; since the system reports 127 units in-transit, which matches exactly (P1+P3+P4 = 127), and none of the recent large orders are in-transit (P8=15 and P9=131 arrived in Period 10), the system currently thinks it has 127 units coming which will never arrive. To force the OR backend to order, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this 'phantom' pipeline. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * average demand (86) + the lost 127 units to ensure the base stock triggers a replenishment order that covers the seasonality and compensates for the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak confirmed for late April: last 4 periods average 86 units, up from P7-P9 average of 72. Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) totaling 127 units are still reflected in system 'In-transit', requiring explicit mu_hat adjustment to bypass the pipeline inventory logic.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29, 2019), the SKU (airy viscose trousers) is in its seasonal peak. Demand in Period 11 reached 184 units, confirming a massive surge compared to the prior three-period average (~97 units). The system currently shows 308 units 'In-transit', but reconciliation reveals significant losses: Period 1 (30), Period 3 (42), and Period 4 (55) are all 8-11 periods old, far exceeding the promised L=2 and recent observed L=1 or 2. Total lost units equal 127. These ghost units in the pipeline prevent the OR backend from ordering enough stock. To fix this, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to 'over-forecast' enough to bypass the pipeline deduction. Current demand trend (P9-P11: 77, 129, 184) suggests a peak mean of ~130. Based on (1+L)*130 with L=2, base stock should be ~390. To account for the 127 lost 'in-transit' units, I will set mu_hat to 517 (390 + 127). This allows the system to place a substantial order despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for airy viscose trousers observed: P11 demand reached 184, significantly accelerating from the April average. Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) totaling 127 units are confirmed as non-deliverable, requiring continued manual inflation of mu_hat to overcome pipeline inventory logic until the 'in-transit' status resolves.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' is an airy viscose trouser, which is experiencing peak spring seasonality in May. Demand in Period 11 reached 184 units, though it dipped to 111 in Period 12, likely due to stockout constraints or slight variance. The main operational challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The system shows 557 units in-transit, but based on history, orders from P1 (30), P3 (42), and P4 (55) are effectively lost (127 units total). More critically, the system counts these lost units as 'pipeline inventory', which prevents the OR backend from ordering enough to meet the current high demand regime (~140-150 units/week). To override this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. Expected demand for the review + lead time (L=2, so 3 periods) at a conservative average of 140 units/week is 420. However, I must add the 127 lost units to the mu_hat requirement to 'cancel out' the 127 units of phantom pipeline inventory that the OR engine will subtract. Therefore, mu_hat = 420 + 127 = 547. I will use a high sigma_hat to maintain safety stock during this volatile peak season.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' currently includes 127 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. All future OR parameters must manually inflate mu_hat by +127 to counteract the backend's deduction of these units from the order quantity until they are cleared from the pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-13. The product is airy viscose trousers, which experienced a seasonal peak from mid-April to early May (demands of 129, 184, 111). Demand has since moderated (79 units in P13). I estimate the new seasonal baseline is approximately 100 units/week. System 'In-transit' is 506 units, but this includes 127 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost (missing for 9+ periods). The OR backend uses 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the pipeline inventory of 506 is significantly inflated by lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order. Target base_stock (L=2) should cover 3 periods of demand. At 100 units/period, base_stock should be ~300. To force an order despite the 506 'in-transit', I set mu_hat to 650 (accounting for the 506 pipeline + desired inventory buffer), effectively neutralizing the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak (mid-May) stabilizing at ~100 units/week. Lost shipments (127 units from P1, P3, P4) remain in system 'In-transit', necessitating manual inflation of mu_hat to bypass pipeline logic.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/20. Demand for 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' (airy viscose spring/summer trousers) appears to have peaked in late April (P11 demand: 184) and is now stabilizing in a mid-May post-peak regime (P13: 79, P14: 83), averaging ~81 units over the last two periods. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 439 units includes 127 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are confirmed lost but still deducted by the OR backend (order = base_stock - pipeline). To ensure these 127 ghost units do not prevent necessary ordering, I am manually inflating mu_hat. I estimate the current demand regime at ~90 units/week to provide a safety buffer for the stabilizing trend. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat (target for L+1=3 weeks) = (3 * 90) + 127 = 397 units. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility observed during the recent transition from peak to stabilization. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P13, P14) have followed the promised 2-period window, though the average will still reflect the instability of earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (mid-May) stabilized at ~81 units/week (Periods 13-14), significantly lower than the April peak of ~184 but higher than the Feb baseline. Lost shipments (127 units) continue to legacy-impact the 'In-transit' figure.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late May, following the peak demand for airy viscose trousers observed in late April. Demand has stabilized at a post-peak mean of approximately 95 units/week over the last three periods (P13-P15: 79, 83, 122). The lead time remains consistently around 2 periods. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 439 units, which includes 127 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline inventory (439) from the calculated base stock, we must manually inflate mu_hat to ensure sufficient new orders are placed. The target weekly demand is ~95. With L=2, the base stock requires 3 weeks of demand (1+L) plus a safety buffer. Standard base stock = (1+2)*95 + Z*sigma. To counteract the 127 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat: ((3 * 95) + 127) \u2248 412. This ensures the 127 units 'ghosting' in the pipeline do not suppress current ordering needed to maintain stock for the upcoming weeks.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (mid-to-late May) stabilized at ~95 units/week. Lost shipments (127 units from P1, P3, P4) remain in system 'In-transit', requiring explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3. Demand at Period 16 spiked to 172 units, potentially indicating a second peak or late-Spring surge for the 'airy viscose trousers'. Historically, demand has been volatile (P14: 83, P15: 122, P16: 172). The average of the last three periods is approximately 126 units. The system shows an 'In-transit' of 439 units. Based on game history, this pipeline includes confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (30 + 42 + 55 = 127 units). Because the OR backend subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the base stock to determine the order quantity, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter by 127 to counteract these ghost units. I will use the recent demand average of 126 units/week. Base stock target for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) is 126 * 3 = 378. Adding the 127 offset for lost shipments results in an explicit mu_hat of 505. This ensures the backend places an order despite the inflated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand showing high volatility in late May/early June (avg 126 units/week). Total lost shipments (127 units) remain in 'In-transit' count, requiring continued +127 adjustment to mu_hat.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/10 (early June). The product is 'airy viscose trousers', which is entering peak summer seasonality. Demand in the last two periods (P16-P17) has surged to 172 and 185 units, signaling a significant step-up from the mid-May average (~80-100). The current in-transit figure (633) includes 127 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are confirmed lost (as they have not arrived in over 13 periods). This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR logic from ordering enough to meet current demand levels. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate forward-looking demand at 180 units per period. For a lead time (L) of 2, the total demand over review + lead time is (1+L) * 180 = 540 units. To bypass the 127 units of lost 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I add 127 to this base, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 667. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the pipeline noise. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed historical average (approx 1.5-2 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the high volatility seen during the recent demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed for June: Weekly demand surged to ~178 units (P16-P17) from a May average of ~100. Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) totaling 127 units remain in 'In-transit' and continue to require manual mu_hat inflation of +127.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19 (mid-June), and demand for these airy viscose trousers is at a seasonal summer peak. Recent demand (Periods 16-18) values of 172, 185, and 140 average roughly 166 units/week. Standard lead time is consistently 2 periods. The critical issue remains the 127 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 which are stuck in 'In-transit' but effectively lost. The backend policy calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)'. Because the 'In-transit' (807) includes these 127 lost units, it under-orders by that exact amount. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset of 127. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Expected demand over 3 periods is 166 * 3 = 498. Adding the 127 offset results in a mu_hat of 625. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 143 (approx sqrt(3) * 83), based on recent volatility and the risk of stockouts during this high-demand summer period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand for the 'airy viscose' trousers is at a seasonal peak in late June (P19 demand: 219). The last 3 periods' average demand is ~181 units/week. Lost shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 127 units) remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (687 units), which artificially reduces the order quantity calculated by the OR engine (order = base_stock - pipeline). To compensate, mu_hat must be inflated. Calculating mu_hat: Promised L=2 (L+1=3). Base demand forecast for 3 periods = 3 * 181 = 543. Adjusting for 127 units of 'phantom' inventory = 543 + 127 = 670. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this +127 adjustment is maintained. Sigma_hat is calculated using 'recent_N' (N=6) to reflect recent high volatility (stdev of ~35 over last 6 periods, scaled by sqrt(1+L) approx 1.73 \u2248 60). Observed lead times are inconsistent (1 to 2 periods), so I use 'calculate' for L.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. Demand is peaking for the summer season (airy viscose trousers), with June demand averaging ~190 units (P19: 219, P20: 220). The inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and current in-transit is 809 units. However, based on the carry-over history, 127 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and have not arrived after 15+ periods. These 127 units indefinitely artificially inflate the pipeline inventory, causing the OR backend to under-order. To compensate, I am applying a mu_hat inflation of +127 units. In the last three periods (P18-P20), the average demand was approximately 193 units. Using L=2 (promised) implies the forecast should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Base mu = 193 * 3 = 579. Adding the 127-unit compensation for lost pipeline inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 706. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to capture current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak sustained: Avg demand for P19-P20 is ~220 units. Lost shipments (127 units) continue to legacy-impact the 'In-transit' figure, requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the peak July summer season for 'airy viscose trousers', a category highly sensitive to warm weather. Recent demand has been extremely strong, with a peak of 220 units (Period 20), although Period 21 saw a temporary dip to 147 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 182.2 units. The game state shows a major bottleneck: On-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports 837 units 'In-transit'. However, 127 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost based on historical evidence. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders, I must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these phantom 'In-transit' units. I will set the base forecast to the recent 5-period average of ~182. Given lead time L=2, the total demand over (L+1) periods is 182 * 3 = 546. Adding the 127 lost units as a buffer to bypass the pipeline deduction, I arrive at a mu_hat of 673. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that prioritizes the high service level required for a $19 profit margin, despite the misleading pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: July demand peak sustained: Avg demand for P17-P21 is 182 units. Persistent pipeline discrepancy: 127 units from P1, P3, and P4 remain in 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost, requiring a +127 adjustment to mu_hat.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15, mid-summer. The product is 'airy viscose trousers', which seeing high demand during the peak summer months. Demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) has averaged 176 units/week, though there is high volatility (range 140-220). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 715 units in-transit, but this includes 127 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost. To ensure the OR backend (which uses base_stock - in_transit) orders enough to meet a 176 unit/week demand with L=2, I must adjust the mu_hat. Following the logic: Needed Base Stock = (L+1) * Demand = 3 * 176 = 528. However, the backend will subtract the full 'In-transit' (715) from this value, potentially ordering 0. To counteract the 127 phantom units and account for the high demand regime, I set L=2 and mu_hat explicitly to provide a target stock level that triggers replenishment. Given the high pipeline and potential recent arrivals not yet concluded (P17 order of 194, P19 order of 54, P21 order of 28), I will set mu_hat to 750 (approx (3 * 176) + 127 + buffer) to maintain availability during this high-demand period.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, mid-late summer. Demand for airy viscose trousers is beginning to trend downwards from the late-June peak of ~220 units to ~109 units (P23). The average demand of the last 3 periods (P21-P23) is ~134 units, indicating a stabilization or gradual decline as the peak summer season passes. On-hand inventory is 0. The system 'In-transit' figure (828 units) includes 127 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are confirmed lost shipments. These lost units will never arrive and must be compensated for because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from its base stock calculation. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + expected L) * (recent mean demand) + (lost units). With L=2, (1+2)*134 + 127 = 402 + 127 = 529. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current volatility of this seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Mid-July demand regime shift: Peak summer demand (~220) is declining, stabilizing at ~134 units/week (Periods 21-23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we are in the late summer season for 'airy viscose trousers'. Demand has shifted from a mid-summer peak of ~220 units (P19-P20) to a more stable but declining regime averaging ~134 units over the last 4 periods (P21-P24: 147, 146, 109, 144; mean = 136.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports 828 units in-transit. However, 127 units from early periods (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, meaning the functional pipeline is 701 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficiently, I must inflate mu_hat to account for these 'ghost' units. Using a 4-period mean of ~137, the expected demand over (L+1) periods (where L=2) is 137 * 3 = 411. Adding the 127 lost units as a buffer to counteract the pipeline deduction gives mu_hat = 411 + 127 = 538. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 60 to allow for late-season volatility, and L to 'calculate' as lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late-July demand regime: Demand stabilized at ~137 units/week (P21-P24), down from June peak (~220). Total ghost units in 'In-transit' remains 127.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (2019/08/05), we are in the late summer/early fall transition. Demand has continued its downward trend from the June peak (~220 units), with recent observations (P23-P25) averaging ~115.6 units/week. The product is 'airy viscose trousers', confirming a seasonal decline as autumn approaches. A critical and persistent issue is the 127 'ghost units' in the system's 'In-transit' count (127 units from P1, P3, P4 are lost but never cleared). Current 'In-transit' is 828, but 127 are non-existent, leaving an actual pipeline of 701. To force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 828 units) to place orders that cover actual demand, I must inflate mu_hat. Forecast: The mean demand for the last 3 periods is ~116; for L=2, the required base stock (1+L)*mu is ~348. To offset the 127 missing units and ensure availability, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as recent deliveries have fluctuated between 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Late July/Early August demand regime shift: Demand has stabilized at ~116 units/week (P23-P25), down from mid-July's 137 units. Total ghost units in 'In-transit' remains 127.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/8/12. We are in a post-peak summer regime for airy viscose trousers. Demand has cooled significantly from the June/July peaks (~220 units) to a more stabilized late-summer level. In the last three periods (P24-P26), demand was 144, 94, and 56 respectively, averaging 98 units/week. However, the most recent observation of 56 suggests we are entering a lower demand phase as we move further into August. The 'In-transit' figure (687) is heavily inflated by legacy lost shipments (127 units from P1, P3, P4) and several large orders from P13-P18 that likely won't arrive or are extremely delayed. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must account for the 127 'ghost' units and the reality that current demand is around 80-90 units/week for this part of the season. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the downward trend (P23-P26 avg \u2248 101) but explicitly add 127 to mu_hat to offset the pipeline inventory logic until the ghost units clear. Lead time average remains volatile but centered around 2; I will use 'calculate' to leverage history.

Carry-over insight: Early August demand regime shift: Demand decreasing as late summer approaches, dropping from ~116 (P23-P25) to 56 in P26. Cumulative ghost units in 'In-transit' remain 127.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/19 (mid-late August). Demand for this airy viscose trouser SKU is in a clear seasonal decline following the June/July peaks. Recent demand samples are: P26 (56), P27 (63), and P25 (94). The average of the last 3 periods is 71 units, showing a significant drop from the mid-July average of ~137. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend and avoid over-ordering as the season ends. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P23 arrived in 3 periods, P21 in 2, P20 in 2) suggest slight variability around the promised 2 periods. A critical factor remains the 127 units of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 5 (confirmed lost but still in the system's in-transit count). To prevent the OR backend from subtracting these 127 units from my required order, I am including them in an explicit mu_hat calculation. Final calculation: mu_hat = ((1 + L_avg) * Forecast_Mean) + Ghost_Units. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 71) + 127 = 340. This ensures the order logic triggers if the true available pipeline + on-hand falls below the seasonal need.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand regime: Demand has stabilized at ~71 units/week (P25-P27), confirming a post-summer seasonal decline. Total ghost units in 'In-transit' remains 127.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/08/26, heading into late summer/early fall for airy viscose trousers, which explains the continued decline in demand (P28 demand: 45). The post-summer demand regime is settling at a lower level. Over the last 4 periods (P25-P28), average demand is ~65 units/week. Lead times are averaging ~2 periods, though variability exists. A critical factor remains the 127 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are permanently lost but still appear in the system's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 687). This necessitates a manual inflation of mu_hat by +127 units to ensure the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) accounts for these non-deliverable units. I will use the last 4 periods to set the demand forecast (avg 64.5), then adjust mu_hat for the (1+L) periods plus the 127-unit offset: (1+2)*64.5 + 127 \u2248 321.

Carry-over insight: Late August demand regime: Demand has stabilized at ~65 units/week (P25-P28 average), confirming a seasonal decline. Cumulative ghost units in 'In-transit' remain 127.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/9/2), the SKU 'Victoria RW Pull-On TRS' is entering the post-summer period. Historical demand analysis shows a clear seasonal decline from July peaks of ~220 units to a current stabilized range of 38-63 units (average ~49 units over the last 4 periods). This fits the profile of 'airy viscose trousers' losing relevance as autumn approaches. 

Lead-time reconciliation: The system reports 'In-transit' as 687 units. However, identifying total inventory requires correcting for lost shipments. Periods 1, 3, and 4 orders (30, 42, 55 = 127 units) are confirmed lost (missing for >20 periods). Additionally, the order from Period 17 (194 units) has not arrived after 12 periods and is also likely lost. Total 'ghost' units in the pipeline are likely 127 + 194 = 321 units. 

Order strategy: With 0 on-hand and an adjusted In-transit of ~366 (687-321), and demand averaging ~50, the pipeline is sufficient. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 321 units it thinks are still coming, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of (1+L)*50 + 321. Assuming L=2 (promised), mu_hat = 3*50 + 321 = 471. This ensures the base_stock calculation accounts for the lost items and maintains service levels for the actual current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Secondary major shipment loss suspected. Period 17 order (194 units) has not arrived after 12 periods (promised L=2). Total ghost pipeline inventory now estimated at 321 units (127 from P1-P4 + 194 from P17). Current demand regime for September stabilized at ~50 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554477005' (airy viscose trousers) has entered a post-summer seasonal decline in September. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level, with the last 5 periods (P26-P30) averaging 47.4 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The critical challenge remains the 'In-transit' figure of 687 units, which contains substantial 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. Based on historical data: P1 (30), P3 (42), P4 (55), and now P17 (194) are confirmed lost/overdue by more than 10 periods. This total of 321 units must be compensated for by inflating mu_hat. To determine the order, I forecast a mean demand of 45 units/week for the current regime. Over the (L+1)=3 lead-time horizon, this equals 135 units. To bypass the backend's deduction of 321 ghost units from the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 135 + 321 = 456. This ensures the OR logic recognizes the need for stock despite the artificially high 'In-transit' count. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance despite the losses.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized at ~47 units/week. Cumulative ghost pipeline inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 321 units (P1, P3, P4, P17).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 16, 2019. Demand for the airy viscose trousers has shifted from a summer peak (~220 units) to a stable late-summer/early-autumn regime averaging approximately 41 units per week over the last 5 periods (P27-P31: 63, 45, 38, 34, 32). This drop is consistent with the product being a seasonal spring/summer item. The inventory situation is critical: 687 units are 'In-transit', but historical evidence strongly suggests 321 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4 totaling 127; P17 totaling 194). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be manually adjusted by +321 units. Furthermore, because on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has depleted all safety stock, I am using explicit mu_hat = ((1+L) * forecast) + ghost_units = (3 * 41) + 321 = 444. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility during this lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: September demand regime stabilized at ~41 units/week (P27-P31). Total ghost pipeline inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 321 units (P1, P3, P4 = 127; P17 = 194).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 (Sept 23), we are in a clear post-summer seasonal decline for airy viscose trousers. Demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 34 units over the last 5 periods (P28-P32: 45, 38, 34, 32, 25). The most critical issue is the system 'In-transit' figure of 687 units, which is heavily distorted by lost or severely delayed shipments. Based on history, we confirm 321 units are lost (P1, P3, P4 totaling 127; P17 for 194 units which hasn't arrived in 15 periods). Additionally, orders from P13, P14, P18, and P19 (totaling 366 units) are now also suspicious as they are far beyond the promised lead time of 2. In total, the 687 units in-transit are likely all phantom inventory. To force the OR backend to actually place an order despite this high pipeline count, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Formula: mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost_Inventory. Using L=2, Forecast=30, and Ghost_Inventory=687, I set mu_hat to 777. This ensures the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a meaningful replenishment quantity to satisfy immediate demand.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure confirmed: Total 'In-transit' of 687 units (P1-P19) is non-deliverable/ghost inventory. September demand regime is 30 units/week.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/30. Demand for the airy viscose trousers is in a seasonal decline for autumn, reaching a stable low-regime average of ~31 units per week (P29-P33). The primary challenge continues to be a massive pipeline discrepancy: 'In-transit' shows 799 units, but historical evidence confirms most are lost (P1, P3, P4 totaled 127; P17 was 194; P13, P14, P15, and P18 orders totaling 486 units are also now extremely late/lost). Only the P33 order (112 units) is likely viable. To overcome the OR backend's logic, which subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock', I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. With a target base stock of (1+L)*31 + z*sigma, and 799 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat to 950 to ensure an order is triggered to meet the actual demand of ~31 units/week and restore on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment failure reaching critical mass: Total ghost pipeline inventory now estimated at 799 units (including large batches from P13-P18). Autumn demand regime (late Sept) has stabilized at ~31 units/week.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/07. Demand for this airy viscose trouser SKU has seasonally declined and stabilized for autumn (Sept avg ~27 units/week). However, there is a massive discrepancy between the system's 'In-transit' count (964 units) and what is actually deliverable. Analyzing history: Orders from P1 (30), P3 (42), P4 (55), P13 (130), P14 (182), P17 (194), and P18 (forced by OR at 174) have effectively disappeared from the real supply chain as they are many periods past the promised L=2. Total 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline is estimated at 964 units (the entire in-transit amount), meaning the backend policy (base_stock - pipeline) will never place an order unless I manually inflate Mu_hat. To ensure the backend places an order to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand at the current regime (avg 27), I need to set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 964' equals a sufficient order quantity. Setting mu_hat to 1045 (approx 964 + 3 * 27) forces a small replenishment to test the arrival pipeline while keeping sigma_hat at a recent_N to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory status is 100% ghost/lost shipments totaling 964 units (P1-P18). Autumn demand regime confirmed at ~27 units/week. All mu_hat parameters must be manually inflated by ~964 to bypass blocked replenishment logic.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/14. We are in the mid-autumn period for airy viscose trousers, a product category that experienced its primary peak in spring and a secondary peak in summer. The recent demand (P33-P35) has dropped significantly to an average of ~19 units/week, down from the September average of ~30. However, the most critical issue remains the 'In-transit' figure of 1067 units. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, 964 units of this total are confirmed lost/ghost shipments (orders from P1 through P18) that never arrived. The OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from its target base stock. To ensure any new order is placed to meet the current demand of ~19 units/week, I must continue to manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 964 ghost units. Without this, the OR engine will see 1067 in pipeline vs. a base stock of ~60 and order nothing, leaving us with zero stock for the rest of the season. I will use a conservative forecast of 20 units/week (mu_hat = (1+L)*20 + 964) with a slightly higher sigma to account for the volatility seen in low-demand regimes.

Carry-over insight: Mid-October demand regime confirmed at ~19 units/week. Cumulative ghost pipeline inventory (lost shipments) from P1-P18 totals 964 units, requiring continued manual mu_hat inflation to allow the backend to generate replenishment orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21. Demand for 'airy viscose trousers' has continued its seasonal decline, with recent demand averaging ~15 units/week (P34-P36). Arrival reconciliation: In Period 36, two orders arrived (P33 and P35), providing a fresh starting on-hand inventory of 197. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 852 consists entirely of lost shipments from earlier periods (P1-P32), as the only active recent orders have already arrived. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, it will stop ordering entirely unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these 852 units. To target a stock level for the next 3 weeks (L+1) based on current demand (~15/week), we need roughly 45 units. By setting mu_hat to 897 (45 + 852), we ensure the OR logic (Order = 897 - 852 - 197) correctly identifies that no new order is needed right now given the high on-hand, while preventing a massive negative ordering gap for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic shipment failure: Cumulative ghost pipeline inventory (lost shipments) has reached 852 units as of Period 37. Demand regime for mid-late October has stabilized at a low seasonal baseline of ~15-20 units/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 38 (late October), the demand for the airy viscose trousers is at its seasonal baseline, averaging 14 units/week over the last two periods. The 'In-transit' count of 852 represents ghost inventory from unfulfilled orders in early and mid-2019 (notably P1-P18 and P19). In Period 36, recent shipments from P33 and P35 finally arrived, leaving the on-hand inventory at 183 units. This on-hand stock is sufficient to cover approximately 13 weeks of current demand (~14 units/week). To avoid accumulating holding costs on a low-demand seasonal item, I will set mu_hat to the current demand level. I am no longer inflating mu_hat because the on-hand inventory is now significantly positive, and further orders are not required. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from ordering more units.

Carry-over insight: Current demand baseline for late October confirmed at ~14 units/week. Residual ghost inventory in 'In-transit' remains at 852 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-11-04 (Period 39). The product is 'airy viscose trousers', which show a clear seasonal decline significantly below early-year levels, now stabilizing at approximately 12-15 units/week. On-hand inventory is 171 units, which at the current demand rate of ~14 units/week, covers roughly 12 periods of supply. The 'In-transit' count remains at 852 units, which are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from failed shipments spanning Periods 1-18. Although this ghost inventory previously required manual inflation of mu_hat to trigger orders, our current on-hand stockpile (171) is more than sufficient for the immediate lead time (L=2) and the foreseeable low-demand season. No new orders are needed. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability (avg ~2). mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P34-P38) to capture the current stable, low-demand late-autumn regime (avg ~14) without inflating for ghost units, as the current surplus protects against stockouts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand for airy viscose trousers has reached a seasonal low, consistent with late Autumn. The last 4 periods show demand dipping into single digits (15, 11, 18, 14, 12, 7), with a current average of ~11 units/week. On-hand inventory is 164 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods of low demand without further ordering. The 'In-transit' figure of 852 represents systemic shipment failures from early-to-mid year (specifically P13-P18 and P17) and is treated as ghost inventory. Given the high on-hand stock and low demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to its minimum level. I am not inflating mu_hat this period because the current on-hand inventory (164) is already significantly higher than any reasonable base stock level for the current demand (11 * 3 = 33). This avoids triggering the OR engine's capping logic and ensures no unnecessary holding costs are incurred for the rest of the season.

Carry-over insight: Late Autumn demand regime (Nov) confirmed at <10 units/week. Systemic ghost inventory remains at 852 units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (2019/11/18), the demand for airy viscose trousers has settled into a low late-autumn baseline. Recent demand (P37-P40) is very low at 14, 12, 7, and 10 units respectively, averaging ~11 units/week. On-hand inventory is 154 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 6 weeks of the simulation, especially given the downward seasonal trend for summer-style trousers. The system still shows 852 ghost units 'In-transit' from systemic shipment failures earlier in the year. Although mu_hat inflation was previously used to force orders around these ghost units, the current on-hand inventory of 154 far exceeds the required base stock for a demand level of ~10-15 units. Therefore, no further orders are necessary. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime and allow the existing inventory to fulfill all remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Late Autumn demand baseline confirmed at ~10-11 units/week (P38-P40). Current on-hand inventory (154) is sufficient for the rest of the year.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019 (Period 42), heading into the final weeks of the year. Demand for 'airy viscose trousers' is at a seasonal low, with the last 5 periods (P37-P41) averaging only 9.2 units per week. Current on-hand inventory is 151 units, which is enough to cover over 15 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 852 units consists entirely of ghost/lost shipments from earlier in the year (P1-P18). Since on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover expected demand through the remaining 5 periods (ending at P47) and we want to avoid further holding costs on a low-demand seasonal item, no new orders are necessary. Parameters are set to reflect this low-demand baseline while maintaining L at calculate to reflect historical behavior, though no order will be triggered due to the high on-hand and ghost pipeline balance.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand for airy viscose trousers confirmed at ~10 units/week for Nov/Dec.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we are at the end-of-season stage for airy viscose trousers. Current demand has stabilized at a very low level, averaging approximately 10 units per week over the last five periods (P38-P42). The on-hand inventory is currently 134 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game at the current demand rate (projected total remaining demand \u2248 50 units). Although the 'In-transit' figure of 852 units consists entirely of ghost/lost shipments from earlier in the year (P1-P18), there is no need to manually inflate mu_hat to trigger new orders as we already have an inventory surplus relative to end-of-season demand. I will use a recent_N of 5 to reflect the current low-demand regime, and set L to default. This will result in a zero order quantity from the backend, which is optimal to minimize holding costs for the remainder of the game.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09 (Period 44). We are in the final stages of the game (47 periods total). The product is a seasonal spring/summer item (airy viscose trousers), and demand has reached a low end-of-season baseline. Demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has averaged approximately 7.8 units/week. On-hand inventory is 132 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (approx 32 units total demand). No new orders are necessary. The 'In-transit' figure of 852 units remains composed entirely of old lost shipments (ghost inventory). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and potentially cancelling orders (though not relevant here as we don't need to order), I continue to provide an L estimate and mu_hat based on the current regime, but the primary focus is clearing remaining stock. I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand end-of-season mean (~8 units) and volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 45 (mid-December), approaching the end of the simulation at Period 47. The product is airy viscose trousers, which are highly seasonal for spring/summer and are currently in a low-demand winter baseline of ~10 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 127 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (Periods 45, 46, and 47). The system still shows 852 units 'In-transit', which are confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year. Although my strategy for most of the year required inflating mu_hat to bypass these 'ghost' units, we now have a significant on-hand surplus relative to the remaining lifespan of the game. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period average (capturing the low late-autumn/winter demand) and keep L at the promised default. No new orders are needed or will be triggered given the high stock-to-demand ratio.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game transition: On-hand inventory (127) is sufficient to cover remaining demand through Period 47 without further replenishment.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47 (December 23, 2019). The current on-hand inventory is 121 units, while demand for the last five periods (P41-P45) has averaged only 6.6 units per week. With only one period remaining in the game after this one, and a lead time of at least 1-2 periods, any order placed now would not arrive in time to satisfy demand within the simulation timeframe. Furthermore, the existing 121 units are more than sufficient to cover the projected demand for the final two weeks (approx. 13-15 units total). Ordering more would only increase holding costs without providing additional revenue. I am setting parameters to ensure no new orders are placed by the OR backend.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have reached the final period (Period 47) for the airy viscose trousers (SKU 554477005). The current on-hand inventory is 115 units, while the demand for the past 6 periods (Nov-Dec) has averaged only ~6.5 units per week, with a maximum of 17. The current stock is more than sufficient to cover any remaining demand in this final step without further replenishment. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 852 units consists entirely of systemic lost shipments (ghost inventory) from earlier in the season, which would otherwise suppress ordering; however, no new orders are required given the end-of-game status. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the late-season low-demand regime (~7-10 units/period) and 'default' lead time settings, as the final order quantity will effectively be zero.
