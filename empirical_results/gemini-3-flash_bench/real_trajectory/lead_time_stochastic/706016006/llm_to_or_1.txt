Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS'. Historical demand from the past 5 weeks shows a significant upward trend: 20, 36, 191, 160, 99. The spike in mid-to-late January (191 and 160) likely represents the start of the spring fashion transition or post-holiday restocking. The most recent demand (99) is lower but still significantly higher than the initial weeks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent higher-volume regime (averaging ~150 units/week). For the lead time L, I will use the promised lead time of 2. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the higher volatility observed in the recent weeks. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand during the 2-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=3 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). Looking at the history, demand has spiked significantly: 20, 36 (Jan 7, 14) followed by 191, 160, 99 (Jan 21 - Feb 4), and now 184 in the first game period (Feb 11). This product (High-waisted skinny denim) is seeing a substantial regime shift compared to the early January baseline. The average demand of the last 4 periods (including the most recent) is (160 + 99 + 184) / 3 = 147.67, or including the 191 peak, (191+160+99+184)/4 = 158.5. We have 227 units in-transit from Period 1, which should arrive in Period 3 (L=2). Currently on-hand is 0, and we lost 184 sales in Period 1. To stabilize, I will use recent_N for demand to capture this higher 'February' regime. N=4 covers the transition into the higher demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting late January/February: demand increased from <40 to ~150-190 per week sustained over 4 periods.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has surged significantly compared to early January, with the last three recorded weekly demands being 191, 160, 216, and 184 (the latter two occurred in P1 and P2). The average demand over these 4 weeks is approximately 188 units. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 455 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (227 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 4. The P2 order (228 units) should arrive in Period 4 and be visible in Period 5. To bridge the gap, I will set L to 'default' (2). I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (~188 * 3 = 564 for L+1). I will also set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the recently increased volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the recent shift and the target service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift sustained over 4 periods: average weekly demand increased to ~185-190 units (from <40 initially).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim) has shown a significant demand shift since late January, now averaging approximately 180 units/week (last 4 samples: 191, 160, 99, 184, 216, 149 - note history provided in prompt vs. game history matches this trend). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible at the start of Period 4). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This indicates a delay or potential loss of the Period 1 shipment (227 units). With 0 on-hand and 567 in-transit, we are experiencing stockouts (sold=0 for Periods 1, 2, and 3). I will maintain the lead time at 2 (default) for now but anticipate that if no arrival occurs next period, the lead time must be explicitly increased. For demand forecasting, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, excluding the early January low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Shipment delay detected: Order from Period 1 (227 units) did not arrive by start of Period 4 despite promised lead time of 2. Potential lead time drift or lost shipment.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', which has shown a significant demand regime shift since late January. Recent demand samples (184, 216, 149, 159) suggest a mean of approximately 177 units per week. Monitoring lead times: the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time in Period 4 (lead_time=2). However, the Period 1 order (227 units) is still missing\u2014it should have arrived in Period 3. This indicates a potential lost shipment or severe delay for that specific batch, though the Period 2 shipment arrival confirms the default lead time of 2 is still functional for other orders. Considering on-hand (69) and the remaining in-transit (Period 3 order of 112 units + missing Period 1 order of 227 units), we must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 weeks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (~177 units/week) and set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the one confirmed receipt, while remaining cautious about the missing Period 1 stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for Period 2 order confirmed at 2 periods. Period 1 order (ordered P1, 227 units) remains missing as of P5 conclude, suggesting a lost shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), the SKU 706016006 shows a clear demand regime shift since late January, now stabilizing with an average weekly demand of approximately 172 units over the last 5 periods (184, 216, 149, 159, 151). The shipment ordered in Period 1 (227 units) is now 3 periods past its promised delivery date (L=2) and has not appeared in any 'conclude' message, confirming it is a lost shipment. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2), so the lead time remains generally stable at 2, but we must account for the lost inventory. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 506 units in-transit (Orders from P3, P5, and presumably P6). To stabilize the stock levels against the lost Period 1 shipment and the sustained higher demand, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~172 units/week (total 516 for L+1). I'll use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility and stick to the default promised lead time of 2 as the physical delivery mechanism appears intact despite the one-off loss.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment confirmed: Period 1 order (227 units) has not arrived as of Period 5 conclude (3 periods late). Pipeline inventory must be discounted by 227 units for manual tracking, though the OR engine sees it in 'in-transit'.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 25, 2019. Historical demand for the last five periods (P2-P6) has stabilized at a high regime with an average of approximately 166.8 units per week (216, 149, 159, 151, 159). The P1 order of 227 units is now officially considered lost as it is 4 periods past its expected arrival, but it remains in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation (390 in-transit = 227 lost + 112 from P3 + 51 from P6). To compensate for this 227-unit 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine will subtract from its order, I must increase mu_hat significantly. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock. With L=2 (promised), we need to cover 3 periods (~500 units). On-hand is 8. In-transit that will actually arrive is 163 (112+51). Real position is 171. We need ~329 more units to reach a 500-unit base stock. However, the OR engine sees 398 (8+390). To force an order of ~330 units, I will set mu_hat to approximately 880 (Base Stock = mu_hat + Z*sigma, where Z for 80% service level is ~0.84. If sigma is ~50, 880 + 42 = 922. 922 - 398 = 524, which is then capped. Using mu_hat = 880 to ensure the backend places a substantial order despite the phantom inventory).

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Confirmed P1 order (227 units) as lost/ghost inventory; mu_hat must be manually inflated to offset its presence in the OR engine's pipeline calculation until it is cleared.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the demand for Jade HW Skinny Denim Trousers remains stable in a high-demand regime, with the last 5 periods (P3-P7) averaging 154.2 units. The Period 1 order (227 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 5 periods past its promised delivery and hasn't appeared in any conclude messages. This 'ghost' inventory is still counted by the OR engine in 'in-transit' (In-transit: 730 = P1:227 + P3:112 + P6:51 + P7:340). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this non-existent supply, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset the 227 units. The required base stock levels for (L+1) periods (L=2) should cover approximately 463 units of demand (154 * 3). However, with 503 'real' units in transit (730 - 227), and 0 on-hand, adding the 227 lost units back into the requirement via explicit mu_hat ensures the engine places an order to maintain safety stock despite the pipeline distortion.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9 (2019-04-08), we analyze SKU 706016006. The demand regime has stabilized following the initial shift, with recent demand samples (P1-P8 excluding initial low samples) averaging approximately 172 units/period (184, 216, 149, 159, 151, 159, 153, 205). The 'in-transit' total of 339 units consists of the missing Period 1 order (227 units) and a recently placed order (likely from P8, though the history shows ordered=0, the backend status shows 339 in transit, which means 227 + 112). Since the P1 order (227 units) is confirmed lost/ghost inventory, and the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory (339) from the target base stock, we must compensate for this missing stock. The current visible demand trend is stable around 170-180. To offset the 227 units that the OR engine thinks are coming but aren't, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock (for L=2) = (1+L)*demand + safety stock. With demand ~172, (3*172) = 516. To trick the engine into ordering because it subtracts 339, I set mu_hat to a value that ensures the order covers current gaps and accounting for the 0.8 service level (z=0.84). Adjusting mu_hat to 740 (explicit) to force sufficient procurement while accounting for the lost 227 units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at mean ~172 units/period over the last 8 periods (Std Dev ~25). Ghost inventory of 227 units from P1 remains in pipeline calculation.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-04-15. Over the last 9 periods, demand has stabilized around a mean of 172 units (total sum 1541 / 9 periods = 171.2) with a standard deviation of approximately 22. The product is a high-waisted skinny denim trouser, which exhibits stable demand in the spring season. A critical issue remains: the Period 1 order of 227 units is confirmed lost (7 periods overdue), but it is still counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit' (pipeline inventory). Since the OR engine calculates 'final order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', this ghost inventory of 227 units causes an artificial reduction in order quantities, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (covering L+1 = 3 periods of demand). Target Base Stock = (3 * 172) + 1.28 * (sqrt(3) * 22) \u2248 516 + 49 \u2248 565 units. To trick the OR engine into ordering enough, I must provide a mu_hat that, when used in its internal base_stock formula, results in 565 units PLUS an offset for the 227 ghost units. Adjusted Target Base Stock = 565 + 227 = 792. Using the 'explicit' mu_hat allows me to directly influence the order quantity to ensure we replenish despite the pipeline error.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 22nd. Product 706016006 (Denim Trousers) has stabilized significantly. Over the last 10 periods (P1-P10), the average weekly demand is 166.2 units with a standard deviation of 28.5. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix (P2=2, P5=1, P6=2, P7=1, P9=1), making 'calculate' an appropriate method for L. The P1 order of 227 units is definitively lost, appearing as 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The OR engine calculates base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). Currently, in-transit is 554 (227 ghost + 112 P3 + 215 P10). Since the P3 order (112 units) is also significantly overdue (>8 periods), it is likely lost as well. Total ghost inventory is 339 units. To offset this 'ghost' pipeline, I will set mu_hat centrally at (1+L)*mean + ghost_offset. With L~1.5, (1+1.5)*166 + 339 \u2248 754. I choose an explicit mu_hat of 750 to force the backend to place an order despite the inflated in-transit figure, ensuring on-hand levels handle upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Total ghost inventory increased to 339 units (P1 order 227 units and P3 order 112 units are missing >8 periods).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (April 29), we remain in a stable demand regime with an average of approximately 165 units/period (last 10 periods). The primary operational challenge is 'ghost inventory'. Pipeline inventory is currently 638 units, but this includes two confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (227 units) and Period 3 (112 units), totaling 339 units. The actual effective pipeline is 299 units (orders from P10 and P11). The OR backend's order logic is: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). To compensate for the 339-unit overestimation of 'in-transit', I must inflate mu_hat (the demand across lead time + 1). At L=2, the required base stock for 165/period is ~495 plus safety stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly to roughly double the expected demand (forecast 165 * 3 = 495, adding ~340 to offset loss), I allow the OR engine to place orders despite the 'ghost' inventory. I will use L=2 and mu_hat = 840 (approx 500 expected + 340 offset) to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Consistent lost shipment pattern: P1 (227 units) and P3 (112 units) are permanently lost (11 and 9 periods overdue). Calculated 'In-transit' in Period 12 (638 units) includes 339 units of ghost inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we face a stockout (on-hand = 0) despite a reported 'In-transit' quantity of 851 units. However, my manual tracking identifies significant 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P1 (227 units) and P3 (112 units) are now 12 and 10 periods overdue respectively, totaling 339 units. The OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation = 851, but the effective pipeline is actually 512 units (851 - 339). Recent demand has averaged ~140-150 units over the last 4 weeks (P9-P12). To compensate for the 339 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Following the logic: Target Base Stock = (1+L) * Forecast + Safety Stock. If the backend subtracts 339 extra units, I must add 339 units to my mu_hat estimate to ensure the resulting order size is correct. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat (explicit) = ((1+2) * 150) + 339 = 789. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to reflect recent demand volatility (~20-25 per week) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Total ghost inventory remains 339 units (P1: 227, P3: 112). These units are effectively lost, requiring continuous mu_hat inflation to correct the OR engine's order logic until cleared.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Demand for the last 10 periods (P4-P13) has averaged 157.0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity reported by the system is 773 units. However, as established in the Carry-Over Insights, there are 339 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: Period 1 (227 units) and Period 3 (112 units). This means the effective pipeline is only 434 units (773 - 339). The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline' to determine the order. To compensate for the 339 units of lost stock that it still counts as existing, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the target logic: desired_base_stock = (1+L) * mu_actual + z*sigma. The OR engine calculates: order = (mu_hat - pipeline_reported). We want: order = (desired_base_stock - 434). Therefore, mu_hat should be set to: desired_base_stock + 339. With L=2 and mu_actual=157, desired_base_stock is approximately 3 * 157 = 471 (ignoring safety stock for a moment). Inflating by 339 units gives a mu_hat target of ~810. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to ensure this calculation is precisely applied, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P5-P14) with a mean of approximately 147 units and a standard deviation of 26. Lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods. The primary operational challenge is 'ghost inventory': Orders from Period 1 (227 units) and Period 3 (112 units) are confirmed lost (missing for 11+ periods), totaling 339 units. The backend OR engine sees an 'In-transit' quantity of 633, but 339 of these will never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Following the logic Base Stock = (1+L)*demand + safety_stock, and the fact that the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (including the 339 ghost units), I will set mu_hat = (1+L)*mean + 339. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 147) + 339 = 441 + 339 = 780. sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility (sqrt(3)*26 \u2248 45).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/05/27), demand remains stable with a mean of ~148 units over the last 10 periods (N=10). On-hand inventory is 0 due to an arrival gap in Period 15. The 'In-transit' of 741 units contains 339 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (Period 1: 227 units, Period 3: 112 units) which are 15 and 13 periods overdue respectively and will never arrive. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this ghost pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Actual L=2. Target Base Stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 148 = 444. The OR engine calculates: Order = Base Stock - (Valid In-transit + Ghost In-transit). To ensure the engine orders enough to reach the valid base stock, I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) = 444 + 339 = 783. This compensates for the 339 units the engine thinks are coming but are not.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-06-03. Demand has stabilized at an average of ~148 units/period over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), though recruitment of early-season data suggests a broader mean. The primary challenge remains the OR backend's 'In-transit' count (820 units) which includes 339 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments in Period 1 (227) and Period 3 (112). These 339 units will never arrive but reduce active ordering. To compensate, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. Expected demand for lead time L=2 plus review period (total 3 periods) is 148 * 3 = 444 units. To offset the 339 ghost units, the functional mu_hat should be approximately 444 + 339 = 783. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 783 ensures the OR engine places an order that covers real demand despite the pipeline inflation. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (approx. sqrt(3) * 28) to account for recent demand volatility (115 to 160).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 18 (June 10, 2019). Analyzing recent demand (Periods 10-17): 121, 119, 150, 138, 136, 160, 115, 86. The average demand has softened slightly to ~128 units/period, down from the ~172 units/period used previously. The 'In-transit' figure of 639 units still includes the 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (227 units) and Period 3 (112 units), totaling 339 units of lost shipments that will not arrive. Effective pipeline = 639 - 339 = 300 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. Desired base_stock = (L+1) * Target_Demand * Z-factor. With L=2, Target_Demand ~ 130, desired base_stock is ~500-600. The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To offset the 339 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 730 (calculated as (1+2)*130 + 339 approx), which ensures the backend places a replenishment order despite the inflated in-transit value. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the current demand volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 663 units 'in-transit'. However, 339 of these units (P1: 227 and P3: 112) are confirmed lost shipments that the OR engine still counts as pipeline inventory. Additionally, recent demand (P17, P18) shows a slight cooling compared to the earlier regime, with the last 4 periods averaging ~115 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 339 units of 'ghost' inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic: Base Demand (avg of last 8 periods ~130) * (L+1) + Ghost Inventory (339). With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (130 * 3) + 339 = 729. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the engine's internal calculations which include the lost shipments. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-06-24. Demand has been declining over the last 5 weeks (154, 115, 86, 121, 78) compared to the earlier average of ~170, now averaging ~110. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' of 339 units (P1: 227 and P3: 112) which are permanently lost but still included in the backend's 'In-transit' figure of 739 units. Effective pipeline inventory is actually 400 (739 - 339). To force the OR engine to order enough to cover the actual demand (~110 per week) while it thinks it has 339 extra units, I must inflate mu_hat. For L=2, the backend uses (1+L) = 3. Expected base stock for demand 110 should be ~330 plus safety stock. To offset 339 missing units, I set an explicit mu_hat of 670 (330 + 340 approx). This ensures the order logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order despite the ghost inventory. Sigma is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand has softened to an average of ~110 units/week over the last 5 periods. Ghost inventory remains constant at 339 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-07-01. Analyzing demand history, the last 5 periods (P16-P20) show a softened demand regime with an average of approximately 102 units per week (86, 121, 78, 110, plus P16 which had demand of 115). Promised lead time is 2, and recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. The critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory' from Period 1 (227 units) and Period 3 (112 units), totaling 339 units. These units are in the OR engine's pipeline (In-transit: 739) but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places an order to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, I must set the mu_hat parameter to [(3 * target_forecast) + ghost_inventory]. Using a target forecast of 105 units/period for the next 3 weeks (315 units) and adding the 339 units of lost inventory, the explicit mu_hat is 654. This overrides the OR engine's belief that 339 units are coming, forcing it to order the necessary 315 units to cover actual upcoming demand. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * std_dev, where recent std_dev is ~20, resulting in approximately 35.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 739 units. As established in prior carry-over insights, 339 units are 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1 and P3: 227 + 112). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 739 - 339 = 400 units. These 400 units consist of orders from P13 (6), P14 (73), P17 (6), P19 (100), and P20/P21 (0), though P13/P14/P17/P19 are significantly late, suggesting further potential losses in the carrier network. Recent demand (P17-P21) has stabilized around an average of 108 units (86, 121, 78, 110, 146). To compensate for the 339 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available supply, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for L=2 should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. At ~110 units/week, target base stock is ~330. However, the OR engine sees 739 units in transit; to trigger any order, its internal base_stock must exceed 739. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory) = 330 + 339 = 669. This ensures the backend recognizes a need for stock despite the phantom pipeline.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-07-15 (Period 23). The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim, which maintains fairly steady demand but has seen a reduction from peak levels (~150-190) to a more recent average of ~110-120 over the last 5-6 weeks. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 739 units 'in-transit'. Based on history, ghost inventory remains at 339 units (Period 1: 227 and Period 3: 112). This means the 'real' pipeline is 739 - 339 = 400 units. Since 400 units are expected and recent demand is ~110/period, but on-hand is zero, we need to ensure the OR engine doesn't under-order due to the ghost units. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To force the engine to order when (on_hand + real_in_transit) < base_stock, we must inflate mu_hat. I will set the baseline mu for a (1+L=3) window at 3 * 115 = 345 units. I then add the ghost inventory (339) to this target to offset the backend's error. Total explicit mu_hat = 684. I'll use a conservative sigma based on the recent volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) is experiencing a period of stockouts due to a significant volume of 'ghost inventory' (339 units from lost orders in P1 and P3) and recent under-ordering. Demand has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 110-120 units per period over the last 5 periods (Recent demand: 110, 146, 111, 106). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The OR 'in-transit' figure is 739 units, but 339 of these are confirmed lost shipments. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. The backend logic for ordering is: order = base_stock - pipeline. Base stock is approximately (1+L)*mu_hat. To cover 3 periods (L=2 + 1) of demand at ~120 units/period (360 units) AND offset the 339 units of ghost inventory, I set mu_hat (which covers 1+L periods) to approximately 700. This ensures the OR engine calculation [700 - 739] doesn't result in zero or a negligible order, while the cap (calculated as mu_hat / (1+L) + safety buffer) will allow a reasonable real-world order to replenish stock. I will use explicit for L (fixed at 2) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/7/29), we have been out of stock for 5 periods, and no orders have been placed since Period 19. The current 'In-transit' of 739 units includes 339 units of confirmed ghost inventory (P1=227, P3=112) that will never arrive. The remaining 400 units in transit consist of orders from P13 (6), P14 (73), P17 (6), P18 (24), and P19 (100), totaling 209 units, plus some recent ghosting or extreme delays as many of these are now >5 periods old. Demand has significantly declined: the mean demand over the last 5 periods is 106.2, dropping from a previous mean of ~140-150. Given the on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is clogged with ghost inventory, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to trigger an order. The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). With on_hand=0 and in_transit=739, base_stock must exceed 739 to generate any order. I will set mu_hat (target for 3 periods) at 900 to ensure we replenish stock for the current lower demand regime (~110/week) while overcoming the 339 ghost units and the 400 likely-lost/delayed units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: average weekly demand dropped to ~106 units over the last 5 periods (P20-P24). Ghost inventory remains 339 confirmed (P1, P3), with additional pipeline units (P13-P19) increasingly likely to be lost due to excessive delays (>5 periods).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (August 5), we are managing SKU 706016006. Demand has structurally softened from the ~172 unit peak to approximately ~106 units over the last 6 periods (P20-P25), with a recent dip to 58-63 units. The most critical issue is massive shipment failure. The 'In-transit' figure of 951 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory. Confirmed lost shipments include P1 (227), P3 (112), P13 (6), P14 (73), P15 (108), P16 (79), P17 (6), P18 (24), and P19 (100). Total ghost inventory is approximately 735 units. These units are >5 periods overdue (promised lead time 2) and haven't concluded. The OR engine subtracts this full 951 from its base_stock calculation. To prevent the engine from ordering 0 incorrectly, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset these ghosts. My target base_stock (assuming 106 units/period demand and L=2) is ~318-350 units. To bypass the 951 in-pipeline deduction, I set mu_hat (target base stock) to approximately 951 + 100 = 1051 units. This forces the OR backend to place an order that restores physical availability while the system waits for the ghost inventory to be reconciled.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed massive supply chain failure: orders from P13 through P19 (totaling 396 units) added to previous ghost inventory (339 units) for a total of ~735 units in permanent 'In-transit' limbo. Physical on-hand is 0 despite 951 in-pipeline. Demand regime has lower-shifted to ~106 units/week since P20.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 is suffering from a massive supply chain failure. As of Period 27, on-hand inventory is 0 while 'In-transit' shows 1100 units. Analysis of history indicates that the following orders are likely lost or permanently delayed: P1 (227), P3 (112), P13 (6), P14 (73), P15 (108 - initially arrived but records show confusion in pipeline), P16 (79 - same), P17 (6), P18 (24), P19 (100). Total 'ghost inventory' is approximately 735-800 units. The OR backend calculates 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'; if pipeline is artificially inflated by lost units, it will not order enough to meet demand. Recent demand (P20-P26) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/week. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1100 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, significantly inflating it to ~1600 to overcome the ghost inventory (1100 current + ~500 for safety margin) + expected demand (100 * 3). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile arrival history, and sigma_hat is set to 200 to ensure a robust safety stock in this high-uncertainty environment.

Carry-over insight: Massive supply chain failure confirmed: ~800 units in 'In-transit' are ghost inventory (orders from P1, P3, and P13-P19). Recent demand regime (P20-P26) average is ~100 units/week. Sustained mu_hat inflation is required to force ordering logic.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status (Period 28): On-hand inventory is 59 units following the arrival of P25's order (212 units). Historical demand analysis shows a stabilization around ~100-110 units/week since P20, though P27 spiked to 153. The 'In-transit' figure of 1557 is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Specifically, orders from P1 (227), P3 (112), and P13-P19 (396) are confirmed as lost, totaling 735 ghost units. Additionally, the large order from P27 (669) is in transit. To force the OR backend to place orders despite these ghost units sitting in its pipeline calculation, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. The goal is to set mu_hat high enough to neutralize the ~800 units of lost inventory while covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~300 units). I am setting mu_hat to 1100 (800 ghost + 300 demand) using the explicit method to ensure safety stock is maintained despite the pipeline clutter. Lead time is set to default (2) as recent actual arrivals (P25) have followed the promised schedule.

Carry-over insight: Current ghost inventory in pipeline is ~800 units (Orders P1, P3, P13-P19). Recent demand regime (P20-P27) average is ~106 units/week. Sustained mu_hat inflation is required until ghost units are cleared or offset.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P20-P28) has averaged approximately 110 units per week. There is a massive quantity of ghost inventory ('In-transit') that the backend OR engine wrongly perceives as upcoming stock. My focus is purely on offsetting this ghost inventory. As of Period 29, the 'In-transit' is 1557 units. I have identified approximately 800 units as definitely lost (Periods 1, 3, and 13-19). Based on recent history, Period 25 (212 units) arrived on time in P27, but Period 26 (149 units) and Period 27 (669 units) are currently the only valid items in the pipeline. This means about 739 units in the pipeline are likely valid, while the remaining ~818 units are 'ghosts'. To force the OR engine to place any order despite this 1557 'pipeline' size, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds this pipeline. Since base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock, and the order formula is (base_stock - pipeline), I set mu_hat explicitly to 1700. This should trigger an order to cover the current stockout, as On-Hand is 0 and recent demand is ~110-150 units. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain control over the massive pipeline discrepancy.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains approximately 818 units (Orders from P1, P3, and P13-P19). Lead time for valid orders (e.g., P25) appears to have stabilized back to 2 periods. Demand is currently fluctuating between 100-150 units per week.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 is currently facing a massive discrepancy between physical and virtual inventory due to persistent 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). As of Period 30, the OR engine sees an In-transit pipeline of 1743 units. However, based on history, approximately 818 units (from Period 1, 3, 13-19) are permanently lost and will never arrive. Additionally, orders from P26 (149 units) and P27 (669 units) are still within or slightly beyond the typical lead time window but haven't arrived at the start of P30. Demand has recently trended between 100-160 units (avg ~115 over the last 10 periods). Because the OR engine subtracts the full 1743 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, it will fail to place necessary orders. I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target base stock to offset this ghost inventory. Calculation: Target base stock for 3 periods (L+1) = 3 * 115 = 345 units. Total In-transit visible to engine = 1743. Offset needed = 1743 - (estimated valid pipeline). To trigger ordering, mu_hat must be set so that (mu_hat - 1743) > 0. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 2100 to force the backend to maintain a healthy physical flow despite the corrupted pipeline count.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' has surged significantly, jumping from an average of ~100-150 units to 282 units in Period 30, likely due to a back-to-school or late summer seasonal peak as we enter September. The system is still burdened by approximately 818 units of 'ghost inventory' (Orders P1, P3, P13-P19) which remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (1483) but will never arrive. Actual valid pipeline inventory is 665 units (P26=149, P29=186, P30=409, minus arrivals). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet both current demand and the seasonal spike despite the ghost inventory offsetting the order logic, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1400. This is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock of ~1600 units based on 4 weeks of ~400 demand) minus (Ghost inventory 818) + (Buffer for uncertainty). This will force an order to maintain stock during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Significant seasonal demand spike detected starting P30 (demand 282, +150% over recent avg). High-waisted denim traditionally peaks during back-to-school period (late Aug/Sept). Ghost inventory remains constant at ~818 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal period (back-to-school/September) for high-waisted denim. Demand in Period 30 and 31 has surged to ~285 units per week, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~100-110 units. Historical ghost inventory (unfilled/lost orders) continues to inflate the OR engine's 'In-transit' figure, requiring us to explicitly set mu_hat high enough to trigger new orders despite the 1483 units supposedly in the pipeline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 98. Assuming a lead time (L) of 2, the next availability is at Period 34. I will forecast demand at the current elevated level of ~285 units/week. To account for the ~818 units of ghost inventory (P1, P3, P13-P19) that the OR backend incorrectly sees as incoming supply, I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost_Inventory. This calculation is (1+2)*285 + 818 = 1673. This forces the OR backend to place an order that actually covers the physical stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak confirmed: Sept demand spiked from ~100 to ~285 units/week (+185%). Ghost inventory remains in 'In-transit' totaling ~818 units from multiple failed shipments across P1-P19.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal peak (Sept/Oct back-to-school) for high-waisted denim. Demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) has averaged ~279 units/week, a massive spike from the previous regime of ~100-150 units. Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' remains a critical issue; approximately 818 units (from periods P1, P3, and P13-P19) are confirmed lost but still perceived as valid pipeline by the OR backend. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, mu_hat must be significantly inflated. The target base stock should cover 3 periods (L+1) of peak demand (3 * ~280 = 840 units). After accounting for current On-hand (241) and valid In-transit (P29 order of 186 and P32 order of 177 = 363), the system needs to order roughly 236 units. However, because the backend sees 1251 in-transit (where 818 is junk), it sees a surplus and won't order. Thus, I will set mu_hat explicitly to offset the ghost inventory: Target Base Stock (840) + Ghost Inventory (818) = 1658 units. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility of this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: September demand stabilized at ~280 units/week (+160% over summer baseline). Total ghost inventory remains ~818 units (Orders P1, P3, P13-P19).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P33) has surged significantly to an average of ~323 units per week (282, 289, 266, 455), confirming the seasonal back-to-school/autumn peak for denim. The total 'In-transit' quantity is currently 1544, but this is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory'. Historical analysis confirms approximately 818 units from P1, P3, and P13-P19 are permanently lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 726 units (1544 - 818). This functional pipeline includes the P32 order (177) and P33 order (293), totaling 470 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and the next order due to arrive in Period 34 or 35, there is a stockout risk during this peak period. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 818 ghost units inflating its pipeline perception, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the required base stock to cover 3 periods (L+1) at the new peak demand (~320 * 3 = 960) plus the ghost units (818), totaling 1778. I set mu_hat to 1778 to ensure the engine generates an order to satisfy actual customer demand while accounting for the supply chain failures.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand peak intensified in late September (P33): demand reached 455 units (+60% over previous peak average of 280).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand seasonal period for high-waisted denim (September/October), though demand softened slightly in P34 to 246 units from a P33 peak of 455. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is approximately 307 units/week. The critical challenge remains the OR engine's 'In-transit' perception of 1908 units. Our analysis of 'carry-over insights' and history confirms approximately 818 units are 'ghost inventory' (failed shipments from P1, P3, and P13-P19). Additionally, orders from P29 (186 units) are now 5 periods overdue and orders from P31 are also potentially delayed. Effective pipeline is likely much lower than 1908. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the inflated pipeline, I will set an explicit mu_hat that offsets the 818 units of confirmed ghost inventory. Using a current seasonal mean of 300 units/week and a lead time (L) of 2, the base requirement is (L+1)*300 = 900. Adding the 818 ghost offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1718. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility during this seasonal peak (Std Dev ~75-80, so sqrt(3)*80 \u2248 140).

Carry-over insight: P29 order (186 units) is now 5 periods overdue, likely joining the ghost inventory. Total estimated ghost/lost inventory in pipeline is now ~1000 units (818 established + 186 from P29).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 36 (Mid-October). The 'Jade HW Skinny Denim' is in its peak seasonal window (Sept-Oct). Recent demand has averaged ~260-280 units over the last 6 periods, excluding an extreme spike of 455 in P33. Supply Chain status: Total 'In-transit' is 1731 units. Ghost inventory calculation: Orders from P1 (227), P3 (112), P13 (6), P14 (73), P15 (108), P16 (79), P17 (6), P18 (24), P19 (100), and P29 (186) are considered lost, totaling 921 'ghost units'. Verified pipeline: P33 (293 units) and P34 (364 units) are currently within the expected 2-3 period lead time window. Actual Pipeline = 1731 - 921 = 810 units. Demand Analysis: Demand remains high but stabilized from the P33 peak. I will set mu_hat using the average of the last 6 periods (excluding the outlier 455) to avoid over-ordering as the peak begins to taper. mu_hat = (1+L) * ~265. Setting mu_hat to 800 (for L=2) and adding the 921 ghost units to 'offset' the OR engine's pipeline view gives target mu_hat = 1721. sigma_hat is set to represent the high volatility of the seasonal peak.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total ghost inventory increased to 921 units (P29 order of 186 units is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost). Seasonal peak demand (Late Aug - Oct) established a mean of ~265 units/week.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand indicates we have passed the peak of the late Sept/early Oct seasonal spike (demand dropped to 158 from peaks of ~455). The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 226 units, but the most recent figure (158) suggests a cooling trend. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 250 units to remain slightly above recent demand while accounting for the lower 158 result. The critical issue remains the 'ghost' inventory. The 'In-transit' count is 1555, but a significant portion (estimated at 921 units) consists of lost orders from Period 1, Period 3, Periods 13-19, and Period 29. These units will never arrive but the OR engine counts them as pipeline inventory. To force an order despite this 921-unit inflation, I set mu_hat to 1200 (which is target_stock + 921) to offset the ghost units. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 as recent arrivals (P30, P32, P33, P35) have consistently shown a lead time of 3 periods instead of the promised 2. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high volatility observed during the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P30, P32, P35, P36). Seasonal peak has peaked and is now declining (from ~280-450 units down to 158). Ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 921 units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 analysis (2019/10/28). Demand has significantly cooled from the September peak (280-450 units) to a post-peak level (~150-180 units/week over the last 3 periods). The pipeline 'In-transit' of 1555 units is heavily distorted by ghost inventory. Total confirmed ghost inventory is 921 units (P1, P3, P13-P19 are long-lost, and P29 is now 9 periods overdue). Subtracting this 921 from 1555 gives an 'effective' pipeline of 634 units. These effective units consist of orders from P34 (364 units) and P36 (117 units). The P34 order (placed P34, lead time ~3) should have arrived in P37 but is potentially delayed. To counter the 921 units of ghost inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I must set mu_hat (target inventory) to encompass the desired real inventory PLUS the ghost volume. Desired service level: (1+L)*mean_demand. Recent mean (last 3 periods) is 195 (weighted slightly for safety). L is stabilized at 3. Desired inventory = 4 * 195 = 780. Required mu_hat = 780 + 921 = 1701. I use explicit to force this correction because the default logic would see 1555 pipeline units and stop ordering entirely, leading to a stockout.

Current Period is 39 (early November). Demand context: The peak seasonal period (late August to October) has subsided. Demand in the last three periods (P36-P38) has stabilized around 173 units/week (158, 182, 178) compared to the 280-450 units seen during the peak. Ghost inventory remains the primary challenge: the 'In-transit' figure of 1899 units contains approximately 921 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P13-P19, and P29). To prevent the OR backend from erroneously suppressing orders due to this 'ghost' pipeline, I must continue using mu_hat inflation. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, calculating (1+L) * (current mean demand of ~175) + ghost inventory (921). Lead time (L) is set to 3 based on recent arrival history (P30: 3, P32: 2, P35: 3, P36: 3). Sigma_hat is set to 50 for the review+lead period to account for recent variability as demand transitions out of the peak season.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P36-P39) has stabilized post-seasonal peak to an average of ~168 units/week. Lead time is consistently 3 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P30, P32, P35, P36, P39). There is a massive discrepancy between 'In-transit' (1782 units) and actual physical arrivals. Ghost inventory remains a major factor: P1 (227), P3 (112), and P13-P19 (396) totals ~735 units. Additionally, the P34 order (364 units) is now 6 periods overdue, and the P29 order (186 units) is 11 periods overdue; both are likely lost, bringing total ghost inventory to ~1285 units. Since the OR engine subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the base stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom pipeline and force an order. I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1=4) period window to 1750 (437.5 units/period) to guarantee the OR engine places an order despite the 1782 units it sees in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total ghost inventory now estimated at ~1285 units (including P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, and P34). Demand has stabilized at ~168 units/week following the end of the autumnal seasonal peak. Actual lead time remains sustained at 3 periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 analysis: The current demand has stabilized post-seasonal peak at a mean of approximately 171 units/week (last 5 periods: 182, 178, 156, 170, and historical mean). Observed lead time (L) has consistently been 3 periods for recent successful arrivals (P30, P32, P33, P36). The primary challenge remains the OR engine's 'In-transit' figure of 1812 units, which is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Confirmed lost shipments include P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, and P34, totaling approximately 1285 units. These units will never arrive but prevent the OR engine from ordering. To offset this, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 171 = 684. To force an order when the engine sees 1812 in pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1812 + (Safety Stock). I will use an explicit mu_hat of 2000 to ensure the engine triggers a replenishment order of approximately 200 units (capped by the policy) to bring physical stock back into the cycle, as current on-hand is 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Ghost inventory confirmed at ~1285 units (P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, P34). Post-peak demand stabilized at ~171 units/week. Actual lead time L=3.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016006 is in a post-peak seasonal phase. After the late-September peak (demand ~455), demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 170 units/week over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). Lead time (L) has consistently been 3 periods for recent successful arrivals (P27, P30, P32, P33, P36). The primary challenge remains the OR engine's 'In-transit' calculation, which includes approximately 1,285 units of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, and P34). Because the OR engine subtracts this inflated pipeline from the base stock, it would normally stop ordering. To force orders and maintain service levels, mu_hat must be 'explicitly' inflated. For P42, with L=3, the coverage period is (L+1)=4. Target base stock = 4 periods * 170 demand/period = 680 units. To offset 1,285 ghost units and trigger an order of roughly 170-200 units, mu_hat is set to 500 (calculated as [Target 680 + Ghost 1285] / 4 ~ 491).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 begins with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' quantity of 2020 units. Based on historical data, ghost inventory (lost shipments that remain in the OR engine's pipeline calculation) is estimated at ~1285 units (orders from P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, and P34). This means the effective pipeline is ~735 units. Demand spiked massively in P42 (506 units), likely due to a Black Friday/Cyber Monday event, following a post-peak stability near 170 units/week. Since arrivals have consistently shown L=3 in recent periods (P30, P32, P35, P36, P39), and the previous P38 order (344 units) and P41 order (208 units) are still in transit, mu_hat must be adjusted to account for the ghost inventory distortion. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 1500, which represents (1+L) periods of demand at a revised mean (~250 to account for recent volatility) plus a buffer to offset the 1285 ghost units the OR engine incorrectly thinks are coming. This forces the OR engine to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Significant seasonal/promotional spike detected (P42 demand 506), likely Black Friday related. Ghost inventory confirmed constant at ~1285 units. Actual lead time L=3 confirmed over the last ~10 periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 9). In Period 43, arrivals from P40 and P41 were received (confirming lead times of 3 and 2 respectively). The demand in P42 spiked to 506 (Black Friday), but returned to 110 in P43. Historically, after Black Friday, demand for denim usually stabilizes or declines until the post-Christmas sales. The most critical issue remains the massive ghost inventory in 'In-transit'. Total in-transit is 1782 units, while on-hand is only 128. From Carry-over Insights, we know approx. 1285 units are 'lost' (P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, P34). This leaves real pipeline inventory at 497 units (1782 - 1285). The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock; therefore, to force an order, mu_hat must be inflated by the ghost inventory amount. Recent post-peak demand (excluding the BF spike) is ~170 units. With L=3, the target stock for 4 periods (L+1) would be ~680. Since the OR engine subtracts 1782, we must inflate mu_hat to offset this. However, mu_hat is defined as (1+L)*demand. I will set L=3 and use 'explicit' mu_hat to account for both the forecast and the ghost inventory correction.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are managing a situation with chronic supply chain reliability issues and a stabilized post-peak demand. Current demand (P43: 110, P44: 113) has settled significantly from the Black Friday peak (P42: 506) and the autumn high-season (avg ~265). The average demand over the last 10 periods (excluding the outlier P42) is approximately 175 units. Lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods, based on consistent arrivals in P39, P40, P41, and P43. The primary operational challenge remains the 'ghost inventory'. Total in-transit as seen by the engine is 1991 units. However, based on the history of overdue shipments (P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, P34, P38), approximately 1629 units are confirmed lost/ghost inventory (1285 from previous periods + 344 from P38 which is now 7 periods overdue). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce current orders; therefore, I must set mu_hat (explicitly) to a value high enough to offset this ghost inventory (~1629 + forecasted demand for L+1 periods). With L=3 and a weekly forecast of ~175, lead-time demand is ~700. Adding the ghost inventory offset (Total Pipeline observed 1991 - True Pipeline ~362), I set mu_hat to 2300 to force the backend to place necessary replenishment orders despite the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Total ghost inventory increased to ~1629 units (P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, P34, and now P38 at 7 periods overdue). Effective lead time remains 3 periods. Post-peak demand has stabilized at ~175 units/week.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in late December (Period 46), approaching the end-of-year holiday season. Historically, demand for this SKU peaked in September and briefly during Black Friday (P42). Current demand has softened to ~100 units/week (P44-P45: 113, 95). However, a major supply chain issue persists: the 'In-transit' figure of 2478 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory'. By tracing historical arrivals, I confirmed that orders from P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, P34, and P38 (totaling 1629 units) are significantly overdue and likely lost. The OR engine's internal calculation [base_stock - pipeline] will incorrectly see this 1629 as available supply and suppress new orders. To fix this, I must set L=3 (as established in recent cycles) and use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will calculate mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand (estimated at 170/week to be safe against holiday volatility) PLUS a massive temporary offset to cancel out the 1629 ghost units. Targeting a base stock that forces an order despite the pipeline bias: Expected Lead+Review demand (4 periods * 170) = 680. Ghost Offset = 1629. Total mu_hat = 2309. This ensures the backend produces a replenishment order to meet actual physical demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory increased to ~1629 units: Orders P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, P34, and P38 (344 units, 8 periods overdue) are definitively lost. Physical on-hand is near zero while pipeline remains artificially high. Actual lead time L=3 remains the stable operational baseline for current valid shipments.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 47 (Dec 30). Demand has moderated post-holiday to ~75-110 range after seasonal peaks. The primary operational challenge remains the massive 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline (units the OR engine thinks are coming but are actually lost). 

Ghost Inventory Calculation: Orders from P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, P34, and P38 (8 periods overdue) are confirmed lost. Total ghost units = 227 (P1) + 112 (P3) + 6 (P13) + 73 (P14) + 108 (P15) + 79 (P16) + 6 (P17) + 24 (P18) + 100 (P19) + 186 (P29) + 364 (P34) + 344 (P38) = 1629 units. 

OR Backend Logic Override: The OR engine uses 'In-transit' (2507) to calculate orders. Since 1629 units are ghost, the 'Effective In-transit' is 2507 - 1629 = 878 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the high 'In-transit' value, mu_hat must be inflated. 

Forecast: Using a recent 5-period average (P42-P46) for base demand gives ~180 units/period (elevated by the P42 outlier). Targeted weekly demand is ~100-110. For L=3, the Base Stock Target should be ~ (L+1) * 110 = 440. However, the OR engine sees 2507 in-transit. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set such that (1+L)*mu_hat > In-transit. Given the high pipeline, I will use 'explicit' to force a mu_hat that compensates for the ghost inventory and targets a sustainable stock level for 2020 Q1.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total confirmed ghost inventory remains 1629 units (Orders P1, P3, P13-P19, P29, P34, P38). Physical on-hand is 0. Recent valid lead time L=3. Demand is normalizing to ~80-100 units/week post-Christmas.
