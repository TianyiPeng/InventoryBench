Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the 'Bono hip belt'. The on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Based on the historical demand provided (seed data), there is a clear upward trend in demand: 0, 0, 37, 61, 109 over the last 5 weeks. This suggests a product launch or a seasonal ramp-up in February. Since the promised lead time is 2, the order cycle must cover 1+2=3 periods. The most recent demand (109) is the most relevant signal given the steep growth. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this recent acceleration (averaging 37, 61, 109 is ~69/period, but the trend is strongly upward). I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect this growth while staying responsive to the most recent data point. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent volatility associated with the demand spike. L will remain at the default (promised lead time 2) as we have no historical arrival data yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The SKU 695584001 (Women's belt) shows a clear upward trend in historical demand: 0, 0, 37, 61, 109, and most recently 63 in Period 1. The low demand in Period 1 compared to the previous week (109) may be due to a stockout, as on-hand inventory was 0 and 63 units were demanded but 0 sold. Total demand across 6 historical points (including P1) is 0, 0, 37, 61, 109, 63. Excluding the initial zeros, the average is 67.5. Given the product type (basic fashion accessory) and the February/March timeframe (approaching spring season transitions), I will focus on the most recent 3 observations to capture the growth regime (average of 61, 109, 63 is approx 77.6). Promised Lead Time (L) is 2. The pipeline contains 130 units ordered in Period 1, which are expected to arrive in Period 3 (P1 + 2). For Period 2 decision, I will use recent_N to reflect the current demand level while acknowledging the stockout constrained the last observation.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a women's belt, and we are entering the spring season where demand for accessories typically increases. Looking at the history: Demand has grown from 37 (Jan 21) to 109 (Feb 4), then 63 in Period 1 and 90 in Period 2. The mean demand of the last 4 observed weeks (109, 63, 90, and the previous 61) is approximately 80. The promised lead time is 2 periods. No orders have arrived yet (P1 and P2 arrivals are expected in P3 and P4 respectively), so on-hand inventory is 0. Since the demand shows a clear upward trend from late Jan/early Feb compared to early Jan, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime. For lead time, I'll stick with default (2) as no deliveries have reached their promised window yet. For sigma, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's hip belt. Historical demand since January has shown a steady increase (0, 0, 37, 61, 109). In the game history (Periods 1-3), demand was 63, 90, and 60 respectively. The average demand across these 8 samples is approximately 52.5. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory because the promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order from Period 1 (130 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3. Since the lead time is 'L periods', an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives in Period 3's arrival phase. The 'Period 3 conclude' message confirms arrived=0, suggesting the actual lead time might be longer than 2 or the shipment is delayed. Given we have 308 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, P3: 130 + 123 + 55 = 308) and zero stock, I will maintain the promised lead time of 2 for the OR backend but set mu_hat to reflect the recent average demand to ensure the base stock levels are calculated correctly. I will use the last 5 samples (109, 63, 90, 60, and we'll estimate current at ~80) for recent_N to capture the established demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1017.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The SKU is a women's belt. Historical demand since Jan 2019 shows a clear upward trend: 0, 0, 37, 61, 109, and recent actual observed demand in Periods 1-4 was 63, 90, 60, 57. The average demand across these 9 samples is approximately 53 units/period, but looking at the most recent 4 periods of active sales data (P1-P4), it is around 67. The promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (130 units) did not arrive in Period 3 or 4 (expected P3), suggesting it is lost. The order from Period 2 (123 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time 2), which is consistent with the promised lead time. Current on-hand is 66, and in-transit is 185 (P1's 130 + P3's 55). Since P1's order is likely lost (now L+2 periods since order), the OR backend's inventory calculation (on-hand + in-transit) will be falsely inflated. To compensate, I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current level (approx 70-80 units/period) and 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure we target a higher base stock that accounts for the likely loss of the 130 units. Calculated mu_hat for L=2: (1+2)*70 = 210. However, because the backend thinks we have 185 in transit that isn't coming, I will set mu_hat higher to trigger an order.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695584001' (Bono hip belt) is currently in Period 6. Based on history, an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 2), confirming the promised lead time. The order from Period 1 (130 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order) and is likely lost; it has not appeared in any 'conclude' message. The order from Period 3 (55 units) was due in Period 5 but has not arrived; it is 1 period overdue. Currently, on-hand is 18. Historical demand (last 5 samples including internal periods) is: [37, 61, 109, 63, 90, 60, 57, 48]. Looking at the most recent 3 periods (P3-P5), the average demand is 55. The higher demand in early February (109) might have been a minor spike or noise. Given the high profitability ($19) versus holding cost ($1), a stockout must be avoided. Because the Period 1 order is likely lost and the Period 3 order is delayed, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent stable but lower-than-peak trend (avg ~63.6), and keep 'L' at 'default' (2) while monitoring the pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is a women's belt. Looking at historical demand (including pre-game samples): Jan: (0, 0, 37, 61), Feb: (109, 63, 90, 60), Mar: (57, 48, 59). Demand surged in early February but has stabilized between 50-60 units weekly in March. In-transit reconciliation: Order P1 (130) is significantly overdue (5 periods past) and likely lost. Order P2 (123) arrived on P4 (L=2). Order P3 (55) is overdue (4 periods since order). Order P5 (33) arrived on P6 (L=1). Current on-hand is 0. Total In-transit is 185, but if we assume P1 and P3 are lost, the pipeline is effectively empty. To be safe given the stockout and uncertain pipeline, I will set mu_hat based on the recent March stable demand (approx 55/week). Since L=2 is promised but we've seen L=1 and L=2, I'll use L=calculate to let the backend average valid arrivals. mu_hat will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current stable March regime (avg ~55).

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (55 units) are likely lost; demand regime stabilized in March to ~55 units/week.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/4/1). Reviewing history: P1 order (130 units) and P3 order (55 units) are confirmed lost as they are far past the promised L=2. P2 (L=2) and P5 (L=1, faster than promised) arrived. Current on-hand is 0, and 'In-transit' is 185, but these 185 units are the lost shipments from P1 and P3, meaning pipeline inventory is effectively 0. The OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the target base stock; since it cannot distinguish lost orders, it will incorrectly see 185 units and likely place an order of 0. To force an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand analysis: Samples (61, 109, 63, 90, 60, 57, 48, 59, 74) suggest a stable mean around 69 units. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand starting from 0 inventory, mu_hat should be ~207. Given the 'Stockout' in P7 and the need to override the ghost pipeline inventory of 185, I will set mu_hat to a value that ensures an order is triggered (target base stock > 185 units). I'll calculate mu_hat using a mean of 69 over 3 periods (~207) and sigma accordingly.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019/4/8), we are managing a 'Bono hip belt'. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (March onwards) has hovered around a mean of 61.2 units (57, 48, 59, 74, 68). The 130 units ordered in Period 1 and 55 units ordered in Period 3 are now significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods and the observed lead times of 1-2 periods; these are considered lost. This loss caused a stockout starting in Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 234 in-transit (orders from Period 8 and presumed legacy in-transit). However, because the backend treats pipeline inventory as the sum of all undelivered orders (including lost ones), it will under-order unless we adjust params or wait for replenishment. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable March/April period and recent_N=3 for lead time to reflect the actual observed performance (1-2 periods). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's belt, which shows stable demand in the recent March-April period. Analysis of history confirms that orders from Period 1 (130 units), Period 3 (55 units), and now likely Period 8 (49 units) are missing or lost, as Period 8's order should have arrived by Period 10 (today's resolution phase) based on the promised lead time of 2. In-transit shows 234 units, but historically, arrivals have been unreliable (P1, P3, and P8 are missing). The demand has settled into a regime averaging 55-60 units since March. I will use recent_N=5 (Periods 5-9) to capture this demand profile (avg: 60), treating the current stock-out as a supply failure rather than a demand shift. Given the supply unreliability, I will set an explicit lead time of 3 to increase the base stock level, effectively creating a safety buffer for the potentially 'phantom' in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Consistent pattern of lost shipments: Period 1 (130), Period 3 (55), and likely Period 8 (49) have not arrived within standard lead times, indicating high supply volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11 (2019/04/22), we have a critical stock situation with only 2 units on-hand. Analysis of the history shows that shipments from Period 1 (130 units), Period 3 (55 units), and now Period 2 (123 units arrived, but this was a while ago) have varying outcomes. Specifically, orders from P1 and P3 are essentially lost. The order from P8 (49 units) arrived in P10 (Lead Time = 2). The current 'In-transit' of 228 units likely includes the lost orders from P1 and P3 (130+55=185), plus the order from P10 (43 units). This means the 'effective' pipeline is likely only 43 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 57 units over the last 7 periods (P4-P10). Because the OR engine counts all in-transit units (including the lost 185) against the base_stock, it will significantly under-order. To compensate and ensure we cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock while overriding the 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Since L=2, mu_hat should cover 3 periods. 3 * 57 = 171. However, to force an order that accounts for the 185 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat. mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + (Ghost Inventory). Target Base Stock = 171 + Safety Stock (~40) = 211. Plus 185 ghost units = 396.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (55 units) are confirmed lost and constitute 185 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a major supply reliability issue where shipments from Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (55 units) are definitely lost (10+ periods since order). The OR backend includes these 185 ghost units in its 'pipeline inventory' calculation (In-transit: 377), which leads it to under-order or not order at all. As of Period 12, the actual pipeline consists only of Period 10 (43 units) and Period 11 (149 units), totaling 192 units. To force the OR backend to ignore the 185 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (for L=2) using a steady demand mean of ~56 units/week (March-April average) and then add the 185 ghost units to that target. Target mu_hat = (1+L)*56 + 185 = (3*56) + 185 = 168 + 185 = 353. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the standard deviation since March. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the successfully received shipments (P2 -> P4, P5 -> P6, P8 -> P10) show varying lead times of 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments from P1 and P3 (185 units total) confirmed; pipeline inventory in system overstates actual availability by this amount.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), we are managing a 'Bono hip belt'. The demand has stabilized around a mean of 52.8 units/week over the last 5 periods. The most critical issue remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory: orders from Period 1 (130 units) and Period 3 (55 units) are confirmed lost (well beyond the promised 2-period lead time), totaling 185 units. Additionally, the shipment from Period 11 (149 units) is due to arrive in Period 13, but because the OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), it thinks we have 381 units in the pipeline. In reality, we only have 196 units (381 - 185) that will ever arrive. To compensate for this 185-unit deficit and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-week window (L+1=3) as 3 * 52.8 = 158.4 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the ghost inventory, I add the 185 lost units to this target, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 343.4. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - 381) results in a meaningful replenishment order to cover actual demand while on-hand is zero.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695584001' (Womens hip belt) is currently experiencing high supply volatility. In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 122 units following the arrival of the 149 units ordered in Period 11. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (232 units) includes 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1 (130 units) and 3 (55 units), which are long overdue and confirmed lost. Specifically, P1 was ordered 13 weeks ago and P3 was ordered 11 weeks ago, while the observed lead time is 1-2 periods. This means the OR backend overstates actual supply by 185 units, which will lead to a refusal to order new stock. Since current on-hand (122) only covers ~2.2 periods of demand (avg ~55 units/week) and the promised lead time is 2, we are at risk of a stockout if we don't adjust. To force an order despite the 'ghost' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the missing 185 units. Expected demand for lead time + review period (L+1=3) is ~165 units. Adding the 185 'lost' units to the base stock target ensures the capped policy permits an order. Demand has recently averaged 53.6 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 20, 2019. Demand has shifted from a stabilized regime of ~55 units/week in March/April to a lower level of ~24 units/week over the last two periods (P13-P14). Supply reliability remains a critical issue; shipments from P1 (130 units) and P3 (55 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 185 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Current system 'In-transit' is 256, but actual viable in-transit is only 71 units (256 - 185). On-hand inventory is 104. Lead time has consistently been 2 periods for successful deliveries. To compensate for the 185-unit discrepancy that the OR backend (pipeline-aware) will use to reduce orders, I will set an explicit mu_hat. The target base stock (assuming L=2, so 3 periods of coverage) for a mean of 25 is 75. However, since the engine will subtract the 'ghost' 185 units from any calculated base stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order if needed or maintains sufficient safety. Given we have 104 on-hand and 71 real units coming, we are oversupplied for the current low-demand regime, so I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average (~34) to allow inventory to bleed down while accounting for the recent demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand dropped from ~55 to ~24 units/week starting Period 13 (Date: 2019/5/6).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bono hip belt has clearly shifted to a lower regime starting from late April/early May (Period 13). The average demand for the last three periods (13-15) is 21 units/week, a significant drop from the previous ~55 units/week. Simultaneously, the OR engine's 'In-transit' figure of 256 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory: orders from P1 (130), P3 (55), and P10 (43) are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and are likely lost. The actual functional pipeline consists only of the P14 order (28 units). Current on-hand inventory (90) is more than sufficient to cover the current demand regime (~21/week) for several periods, especially considering the 2-period lead time. To prevent excessive over-ordering caused by the system's incorrect pipeline accounting, I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect the lower demand and a conservative lead time. Even with the ghost inventory, the OR engine might try to order if it perceives the demand as high. Setting mu_hat to 75 (based on ~25 units/week x 3 periods for review+lead) and sigma_hat to 15 will signal the engine to stop ordering while we draw down the current 90 units on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~21 units/week since Period 13; P10 (43 units) confirmed lost, joining P1 and P3 as ghost inventory total of 228 units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for the 'Bono hip belt' has significantly shifted downward starting around Period 13 (May 6th). Demand in the last four periods was 27, 22, 14, and 8, averaging approximately 18 units/week, compared to the previous regime of ~55 units/week. This represents a clear seasonal or trend-based decline. On-hand inventory is currently 82 units, which covers over 4 weeks of the current demand pace. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 256 is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from failed shipments in Period 1 (130), Period 3 (55), and Period 10 (43), totaling 228 units that are likely lost. The actual pipeline is only 28 units (ordered Period 14). However, with 82 units on-hand and a demand of ~18/week, the current stock is sufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) even without the pipeline. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the new lower demand regime and use the default lead time (2) as recent successful arrivals (P11, P12) confirmed the 2-period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~18 units/week since Period 13 (prev ~55). Total lost 'ghost' inventory confirmed at 228 units (P1, P3, P10 orders).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Bono hip belt' has shifted to a significantly lower regime starting Period 13 (approx. 2019/5/6). The mean demand for the last 5 periods is 16.6 units/week (27, 22, 14, 8, 12). Current on-hand inventory is 70 units. Total in-transit is listed as 256, but historical analysis confirms that orders from P1 (130), P3 (55), and P10 (43) are lost, totaling 228 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Real in-transit is 28 units (ordered Period 14). Total real inventory (On-hand 70 + Real Pipeline 28) is 98 units. With a lead time of 2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand. At the current rate (~17 units/week), 3 periods of demand is ~51 units. Since 98 > 51, no new order is needed. However, the OR backend sees 256 + 70 = 326 units and will under-order even more. To prevent stockouts if the ghost inventory is never cleared and true demand persists, I will explicitly set mu_hat to the recent mean (17 * 3 = 51) and sigma_hat based on the recent lower volatility to allow the OR engine to correctly value the current physical stock against actual demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for this SKU has significantly dropped and stabilized at a lower level since Period 13 (approx. 15-20 units/week, down from ~55). Recent demand samples from Periods 13 to 18 are: 27, 22, 14, 8, 12, 8. Average demand over these 6 periods is 15.1 units. The 'In-transit' balance of 256 units is primarily composed of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in periods 1 (130), 3 (55), and 10 (43), totaling 228 units. Only 28 units (ordered Period 14) are actually in transit. Actual in-stock inventory + real pipeline (62 + 28 = 90) easily covers the forecasted demand for the lead time plus review period (3 * 15.1 = 45.3). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 228 ghost units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * average_recent_demand + total_lost_units = (1+2)*15.1 + 228 = 273.3. This adjustment forces the base stock level high enough to offset the phantom inventory counted by the system.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is June 24, 2019 (Period 20). The demand regime for the 'Bono hip belt' has significantly shifted downwards since May (Period 13), averaging approximately 15.5 units/week over the last 7 periods (P13-P19), compared to the earlier average of ~55. The current on-hand inventory is 44 units, which at the current burn rate covers nearly 3 periods of demand. The 'In-transit' figure of 256 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments in P1 (130), P3 (55), and P10 (43), totaling 228 units. Actual reliable pipeline inventory is likely only 28 units (from P14). Since the system's OR backend uses (base_stock - pipeline) to order, it sees 44 (on-hand) + 256 (pipeline) = 300 units available, which is far above any reasonable base stock for this low-demand regime, ensuring no new orders will be placed. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture the recent low-demand regime (starting P13) and N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 2 periods for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~15.5 units/week since Period 13 (Date: 2019/5/06). Total confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory remains 228 units (P1, P3, P10 orders).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 analysis: Demand since Period 13 has averaged approximately 20.25 units per week (27, 22, 14, 8, 12, 8, 18, 53). Although demand spiked to 53 last period, this likely represents a seasonal or promotional peak for a summer accessory (hip belt) and doesn't necessarily signal a sustained shift back to the early-year mean of ~55. On-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units are 256, but 228 of these (from P1, P3, and P10) are confirmed lost 'ghost' units. The OR engine subtracts all pipeline inventory (256) from the base stock. To force an order that covers actual demand, mu_hat must be set to compensate for this 228-unit discrepancy. Target base stock = (forecast for L+1 periods) + 228 units. Using an L of 2 (3 periods total) and a forecast of ~25 units/week, target base stock is (3 * 25) + 228 = 303. To achieve this, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=8) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand volatility increased (spike to 53 from previous avg of 15). Ghost inventory (P1, P3, P10) total remains at 228 units, necessitating offset in mu_hat to trigger ordering.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695584001' (Bono hip belt) has entered a high-demand phase in early July, with demands of 53 and 77 in the last two periods, significantly exceeding the May-June average of ~15 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 0. System 'In-transit' is 346, but this includes 228 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P10) that will never arrive. The 'effective' pipeline is only 118 units (P14: 28 units, P21: 90 units). Because the OR backend (base stock policy) subtracts the full 346 units of pipeline from its target, it will not place an order unless I artificially inflate the target (mu_hat). To force an order that covers the current demand spike (~65 units/week) over the 3-period lead-time cycle (L=2, L+1=3), I need a base stock around 200-250 units. Setting mu_hat to 650 (which reflects an 'effective' forecast of 65 * 3 = 195, plus a ~450 unit offset to overcome the 228 lost units and the backend's internal calculation) ensures the order is placed despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: July demand spiked to avg ~65 units/week (Periods 20-21) vs ~15 units/week in June. Significant lost inventory (228 units) still requires mu_hat inflation for the OR engine to trigger orders.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15), we observe a significant high-demand regime in July, with the last three periods showing demand of 53, 77, and 109 (average ~80 units/week). This is a dramatic increase from the May-June average of ~15 units/week. Additionally, the system currently shows 606 units in-transit. Based on historical data, we have confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P1 (130), P3 (55), and P10 (43), totaling 228 units. Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts this ghost inventory from the base stock calculation, it will fail to place necessary orders unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate. To trigger an order that covers the current demand regime (~80 units/week) while overcoming the 228 units of false pipeline inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand + Ghost = 3*80 + 228 = 468. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 500 to ensure we replenish stock for this high-demand summer period, and set sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (standard deviation of the last 3 samples is ~28, so sqrt(3)*28 \u2248 48).

Carry-over insight: July demand surge confirmed: Average demand increased to ~80 units/week (last 3 periods) compared to ~15 in June. Total ghost inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P10) remains at 228 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3110.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand summer seasonal peak. Demand in the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 53, 77, 109, and 173 units respectively, showing a rapid acceleration. The mean demand for this recent high-growth regime (N=4) is 103 units/week. Furthermore, the 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in P1, P3, and P10 (totaling 228 units) remains in the system's pipeline inventory count. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock to compensate for these 228 missing units plus the forecast for L+1 periods. With L=2, L+1 = 3. Expected demand over 3 periods is 309 units (3 * 103). To trigger a correct order, mu_hat must be at least 309 + 228 = 537. Given the extreme momentum, I will set mu_hat to 600 to ensure we capture the peak and account for the pipeline distortion. Sigma_hat is set to 100 to account for the high volatility observed during this spike.

Carry-over insight: July demand surge intensified in P23 (173 units), confirming a high-growth seasonal peak far exceeding June levels. Ghost inventory (P1, P3, P10) total remains 228 units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695584001' (grained imitation leather belt) is in a significant July peak. Demand over the last four periods (P21-P24) has been 77, 109, 173, and 106, averaging ~116 units/week. This is a massive shift from the May/June low of ~15 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 71, and in-transit is 551. However, 228 units in the 'in-transit' total are known lost shipments (P1: 130, P3: 55, P10: 43), meaning the OR engine's perceived pipeline (551) is significantly higher than the functional pipeline (323). To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory and ensure the base stock calculation (which subtracts pipeline from target) triggers an order during this peak, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target for (L+1=3) periods based on the current high-demand mean (~116 * 3 = 348) and add the 228 unit ghost inventory offset to reach 576. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high volatility (std dev) observed during this July surge (~40).

Carry-over insight: July demand surge confirmed: Average weekly demand ~116 (weighted by recent P23 peak). Total ghost inventory from known lost shipments (P1, P3, P10) remains 228 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (August 5th), we are managing a seasonal peak for SKU 695584001 (Bono hip belt). Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the demand has averaged approximately 106.6 units/week (77, 109, 173, 106, 68), significantly higher than the early summer regime of ~15 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). In-transit inventory is 621 units, but 228 units are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory from P1, P3, and P10. This results in an effective pipeline of 393 units (from P24-P25 orders). Since the OR backend uses the total in-transit figure (621), it likely believes we are overstocked. To force the necessary orders to maintain the current demand level of ~107 units/week, mu_hat must be adjusted to account for the (1+L) periods and the 228 units of missing stock. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 550 ((1+2) * 107 + 228 \u2248 550) will signal the OR engine to order sufficient stock to cover the seasonal peak while offsetting the ghost inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability observed (ranging from 1 to 2 periods).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695584001 (Women's belt) is in a high-demand seasonal peak (August). Demand has averaged 108 units over the last 4 periods (P23-P26: 173, 106, 68, 87). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 665 units, but this includes 228 units of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1: 130, P3: 55, P10: 43). To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat (the target level) to exceed the reported pipeline plus the next 3 periods of expected demand (arrival window). I estimate 3 periods of demand (L+1) at ~100 units/period (300 total) plus the ghost inventory (228), requiring a mu_hat of at least 528. However, recent demand volatility is high, so I will use an explicit mu_hat of 650 to maintain a high service level during this peak and clear the ghost inventory bias. I will set L to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22 at L=1, P21 at L=2) suggest lead times are stabilizing near the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory overstates availability by 228 units due to lost orders P1, P3, and P10. Demand remains in high-season regime (~100 units/week) for August.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 695584001 is in a high-demand seasonal peak for August (Avg demand ~90 units/week). Period 27 conclude shows Period 25 order arrived with lead_time=2, and Period 24 (295 units) is now at lead_time=3. This indicates a potential lead time extension or a lost shipment. More critically, the 'In-transit' quantity of 693 units is heavily inflated by 228 units of 'ghost inventory' from historical lost shipments (P1: 130, P3: 55, P10: 43), as noted in carry-over insights. These units will never arrive, but the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock calculation, preventing necessary orders. Demand in the last 4 periods (P24-P27) was 106, 68, 87, 91 (avg 88). To compensate for the 228 ghost units and the current stockout (On-hand: 0), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) * 88 = 3 * 88 = 264. To offset the 228 ghost units, I set mu_hat = 264 + 228 = 492. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture high seasonal volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Order from Period 24 (295 units) is now overdue (promised L=2, now at L=3), suggesting further supply instability alongside established ghost inventory (228 units).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695584001' is in a high-demand seasonal regime (~88 units/week in August). I must account for significant supply instability: 228 units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P1, P3, P10 orders lost but still in the system's pipeline count), and the Period 24 order (295 units) is now overdue (L=5, promised L=2), bringing total suspect pipeline to 523 units. Current 'In-transit' is 693, but actual dependable in-transit is likely only 170 units (P26, P27). With 0 on-hand and an overdue large shipment, I must set mu_hat high enough to bypass the OR engine's 523 units of false inventory while ensuring safety stock for the high-demand period. I use explicit mu_hat to signal a demand of ~90 units/week over (L+1)=3 periods, plus an offset for the 228 units of confirmed lost stock to trigger replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Order from Period 24 (295 units) is severely delayed (L=5 vs promised L=2); total 'ghost' inventory (suspected or confirmed lost) now totals 523 units (P1, P3, P10, P24).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 30 (2019/9/2): There is a severe supply disruption. On-hand inventory is 0, and current system in-transit inventory is 693 units. However, I have identified multiple 'ghost' shipments that are almost certainly lost: Period 1 (130), Period 3 (55), Period 10 (43), and now Period 24 (295). Total lost inventory is 523 units. The remaining 'real' in-transit inventory is 170 units (from P26 and P27). Demand has stabilized in a high-season regime, averaging ~88 units/week over the last three periods (P27-P29). To force the OR backend to place a new order despite the 693 units of recorded pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat to offset the ghost units. Target Inventory (Base Stock) should be roughly (Ghost units + Real requirements for 3 periods). Calculation: 523 (ghost) + 3 weeks * 90 units/week = 793. I will explicitly set mu_hat to 793 to ensure the backend generates an order covering current demand while accounting for the supply breakdown.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost or severely overdue shipments reaches 523 units (P1: 130, P3: 55, P10: 43, P24: 295). Only 170 units of the current 693 in-transit are likely to arrive.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Bono hip belt' has stabilized in a high-season regime, averaging approximately 85 units/week over the last 5 periods (P26-P30: 87, 91, 88, 89, 71). Lead times are unstable: P27 order arrived in 3 periods, while P24 (295 units), P25 (70 units - previously assumed arrived but P27 arrived instead), and historical orders P1, P3, and P10 are severely overdue or confirmed lost. The 'ghost' inventory (in-transit units that will never arrive) currently totals 593 units (P1: 130, P3: 55, P10: 43, P24: 295, P25: 70). Since the OR engine subtracts all 722 'in-transit' units from the base stock, it believes we are overstocked. To force an order, I must set mu_hat to cover the expected demand plus the 593 ghost units. For L=3, expected demand is (1+3)*85 = 340. Adding 593 units of lost inventory requires a mu_hat of ~933. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the engine's calculation and 'recent_N' for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' inventory (lost or severely overdue) has increased to 593 units (P1: 130, P3: 55, P10: 43, P24: 295, P25: 70). Only 129 units of the current 722 'in-transit' are likely to arrive (P26: 44, P30: 127). Demand remains stable at ~85 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 695584001 remains in its high-season regime after the July/August surge, though it seems to be slightly stabilizing around 60-80 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The significant challenge is the reliability of 'In-transit' inventory. A total of 593 units are confirmed as 'ghost' inventory (orders from P1, P3, P10, P24, and P25) that are highly unlikely to arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full 933 units of in-transit from the target base stock, leading to persistent stockouts. To force the engine to place necessary orders, I am continuing to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock to account for both the demand of the (L+1) period and the 593 units of lost pipeline. Target Calculation: Expected demand for (2+1) periods = 3 * 75 = 225 units. Adding the 593 'ghost' units gives a target mu_hat of ~818 units. Sigma is set based on recent variability (STDEV of last 8 periods is ~14, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~25).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' inventory (lost or severely overdue) is 593 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25). This amount must be added to mu_hat to offset the OR engine's pipeline calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $762.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a steady demand regime following the high-summer peak, with the last 3 periods showing demand of 71, 58, and 55 (avg ~61). Period 32 saw a significant arrival of 338 units (from Period 30 and 31 orders), bringing on-hand inventory to 283. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 595 is heavily distorted by 'ghost' inventory from lost or severely overdue shipments: P1 (130), P3 (55), P10 (43), P24 (295), and P25 (70) total 593 units. Only the Period 26 order (44 units) is genuinely in transit and likely to arrive. Since the OR engine's logic is 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', the presence of 593 units of ghost inventory in the 'in_transit' variable will prevent the OR engine from ordering for many periods, leading to a stockout once the current 283 units are depleted. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat to (1+L) * average_demand + Ghost_Inventory. Recent demand average (last 3 periods) is 61. Expected demand over (1+L) periods where L=2 is 183. Total mu_hat = 183 + 593 = 776. This 'explicit' mu_hat forces the backend to recognize the need for more stock despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed total ghost inventory is 593 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25). Demand regime has settled to ~60 units/week post-summer peak.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a post-summer stabilization phase with demand averaging ~60 units over the last three weeks (71, 55, 58). On-hand inventory is 212 units, which is healthy. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 595 is heavily distorted by long-lost shipments: Period 1 (130), Period 3 (55), Period 10 (43), Period 24 (295), and Period 25 (72). Total 'ghost' inventory is 595 units. Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - in_transit' to calculate orders, and 'in_transit' is populated by these units that will never arrive, the system will not place new orders unless we inflate mu_hat. To ensure the backend can respond to future demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to the sum of (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Expected demand is ~60, L=2, so (60 * 3) + 595 = 775. This allows the backend to 'see' through the lost shipments and maintain a real-world buffer. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) from P1, P3, P10, P24, and P25 now totals 595 units. This matches the current 'In-transit' balance exactly, meaning there are zero actual units currently expected to arrive.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable following the summer peak, with recent demand averaging approximately 65 units/week (last 5 periods: 71, 58, 55, 71, 69). The current on-hand inventory is 143 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 602 units, but based on historical analysis, 595 of these units represent confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 10, 24, and 25 (130+55+43+295+72 = 595). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is approximately 7 units (from Period 34). To trigger an order from the backend OR engine, mu_hat must be inflated to account for this 595-unit 'ghost inventory' discrepancy. I set L to default (2). I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*65 + 595 = 195 + 595 = 790. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock level that ignores the phantom in-transit units. sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent variance around the mean of 65.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory (permanently lost shipments) updated to 595 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25). Current effective in-transit inventory is only ~7 units despite system showing 602.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a post-summer demand regime (August/September), with demand stabilizing around 60-70 units per week. The critical issue is the 'pipeline inventory' calculation by the OR backend. We have 697 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms that 595 units of this total are from lost shipments (P1: 130, P3: 55, P10: 43, P24: 295, P25: 70, P26: 2). The order from P26 (44 units) is now 10 periods overdue and must be considered lost. Therefore, the effective in-transit inventory is 102 units (P34: 7, P35: 95). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 595 'ghost' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the base stock for a 3-week window (L+1) at a forecasted demand of 65 units/week (= 195 units) and add the 595 ghost units to this target, totaling 790. This ensures the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) sees a net requirement for active stock despite the inflated pipeline figure. Sigma is set to cover recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory (permanently lost shipments) updated to 595 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). Current effective in-transit inventory is only 102 units despite system showing 697.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we face a significant 'ghost' inventory issue where 595 units in the 'In-transit' balance (633 units) are permanently lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). The OR engine sees 633 units coming, but only 38 units (P34: 7, P36: 31) are actually likely to arrive. To force the OR engine to order, mu_hat must be inflated by the ghost inventory amount (595). The current demand regime has stabilized post-summer at approximately 65 units/week (average of P33-P36). With a promised lead time of 2, the required coverage for (L+1) periods is approximately 3 * 65 = 195 units. Adding the 595 ghost units to this base results in a mu_hat of 790. This ensures the engine's calculation (base_stock - 633) results in a positive order reflecting actual demand needs. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in recent arrival times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory (permanently lost shipments) is now 595 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). Genuine in-transit inventory is 38 units. Demand stabilized at ~65 units/week.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '695584001' (Womens' hip belt) is moving out of its summer peak into a steady autumn regime. Current demand (Period 37) was 97 units, following a stabilization period around ~65-80 units/week. My primary concern is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The system shows 726 units in transit, but analysis of the 'conclude' messages confirms that 639 units are permanently lost or severely overdue (P1: 130, P3: 55, P10: 43, P24: 295, P25: 70, P26: 44). Only the orders from P34 (7), P36 (31), and P37 (93) are likely to arrive (total 131 units). To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 726 units it 'sees' in transit, I am setting mu_hat to a value that exceeds on-hand + pipeline. Calculating: Target Inventory = (forecast (85) * (L+1)) + ghost_offset (639). With L=2, mu_hat = (85 * 3) + 639 = 894. This uses 'explicit' to bypass the engine's calculation which would otherwise see enough pipeline to cover the next year of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments) increased to 639 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). Effective in-transit inventory is only 131 units (P34, P36, P37). Demand has shifted slightly higher in October to ~85 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the early November period. Historically, demand was stable around 65-70 units/week but has shown volatility in October (fluctuating between 49 and 97). Average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 71 units/week. Most importantly, 'In-transit' inventory is significantly inflated by 'ghost' orders (lost or severely overdue shipments) that the OR backend incorrectly counts as future supply. Total confirmed ghost inventory covers orders from Periods 1 (130), 3 (55), 10 (43), 24 (295), 25 (70), and 26 (44), totaling 637 units. Total In-transit is currently 842. Subtracting 637 gives 205 units of genuine pipeline (mostly the P38 order of 209). To overcome the OR backend's refusal to order due to ghost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1 = 3) while offsetting the 637 ghost units, the required mu_hat is approximately (72 * 3) + 637 = 853. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost inventory enough to maintain actual service levels.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory from lost/overdue shipments (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26) is confirmed at 637 units. Genuine in-transit is ~205 units. Demand regime for late Oct/early Nov is ~72 units/week.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Bono hip belt has stabilized around a mean of 68 units/week over the last 10 periods (since P30). The current on-hand inventory is 17 units. The system reports 827 units in-transit, but 637 of these are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost or severely overdue shipments from P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, and P26). Therefore, the genuine pipeline inventory is only 190 units (from P38 and P39). To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the inflated 'in-transit' count, I will set mu_hat to the expected demand for (L+1) periods PLUS the ghost inventory: (3 periods * 68 units/period) + 637 units = 841 units. This compensates for the system's overestimation of available stock and maintains a service level targeted at the upcoming mid-November demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Genuine pipeline inventory confirmed as 190 units against system reported 827. Ghost inventory remains at 637 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). demand regime remains stable at ~68 units/week.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system reports 866 units in-transit. However, based on our historical tracking of shipments, 637 units (from P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, and P26) are confirmed lost/severely overdue and should be treated as 'ghost' inventory. Actual genuine arrivals expected are from P38 (209 units), P39 (16 units), and P40 (39 units), totaling 264 units. The current reported on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at approximately 55-60 units per week over the last four periods (mean of P37-P40 is 59.5). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 637-unit pipeline overstatement, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand plus the ghost inventory offset: (60 units * 3) + 637 units = 817. I set mu_hat to 817. L and sigma_hat are set to 'default' and 'recent_N' respectively to maintain standard lead time and capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Genuine pipeline inventory confirmed as 264 units (P38, P39, P40 orders) against system reported 866. Ghost inventory remains at 637 units. Demand regime for November is stabilizing around 60 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25, 2019), the 'In-transit' inventory of 874 units remains heavily inflated by 637 units of 'ghost' inventory from confirmed or highly likely lost orders (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). The actual pipeline inventory consists of orders from P38 (209 units), P40 (39 units), and P41 (24 units), totaling 272 genuine units. The OR engine (capped policy) subtracts the full 874 units from the base stock calculation, which would prevent any new orders until this phantom inventory 'clears' (it won't). To bypass this and ensure available units for customers, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. Current mean demand for November is ~45 units/week. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 45) + 637 = 772. This forces the backend to recognize a higher requirement, triggering orders to cover real demand despite the system's overestimation of pipeline stock. Lead time is kept at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P37-P39) range from 1 to 3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43 (Dec 2), we are entering the peak holiday season for accessories like 'Bono hip belt'. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 49 units, but seasonal expectations for December suggest higher volatility and potential spikes. The primary challenge remains the systemic 'ghost inventory'. The backend sees an In-transit balance of 874 units. However, based on history, orders from P1 (130), P3 (55), P10 (43), P24 (295), P25 (70), and now P26 (44) are long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 637 ghost units. This means the actual functional pipeline is only 237 units (Orders from P38, P40, P41). To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 637-unit phantom surplus, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the required base stock (approx 3 periods of demand at ~60/week) plus the 637 ghost units to offset the backend's calculation. This ensures the engine doesn't see the ghost inventory as covering future demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory from lost shipments is confirmed at 637 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). Genuine pipeline is 237 units. Demand expected to rise due to December seasonality.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44 (Dec 9), we are entering the peak December shopping season for this women's hip belt. Historically, there was a significant surge in demand during the summer peak, and we expect a similar uplift for the holidays. Recent demand has stabilized around 40-55 units/week in November, but December is likely to see mean weekly demand return to levels seen in late summer/early autumn (approx. 75-85 units/week). Crucially, the system reports 'In-transit' as 811 units, but my tracking of 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, and P26) totals 637 units. This means the actual pipeline inventory is only 174 units (orders from P34, P38). To force the OR backend to place an order and prevent stockouts during the holiday peak, I must increase mu_hat significantly to bridge the gap created by these 637 ghost units. By settting mu_hat to 850, I account for (1+L) periods of holiday demand (approx 3 * 85 = 255) plus the 637 lost units (totaling ~892), rounded to 850 for safety against holding costs while ensuring the backend logic triggers a restock.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Holiday demand ramp-up expected. Total confirmed ghost inventory remains 637 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). Genuine pipeline inventory is 174 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 45 (mid-December), a peak retail season for accessories like the Bono hip belt. Historically, this SKU experienced significant demand spikes in late summer (up to 173 units/week), and we expect a similar holiday ramp-up now. In Period 44, demand was low (10 units), but this is likely the 'calm before the storm' given the December context. Most critically, we must address the 'ghost inventory' - the system shows 1,051 units in-transit, but 637 of these units (from P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26) are confirmed lost or severely overdue and will never arrive. The OR engine incorrectly assumes this pipeline will satisfy future demand, preventing necessary new orders. To force the OR engine to order despite this 637-unit ghost buffer, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as: ((Lead Time + 1) * Projected Demand) + Ghost Inventory. With L=2, (3 * ~75 units demand) + 637 ghost units = 862. Setting mu_hat to 862 ensures the backend sees a 'need' for stock after subtracting the false pipeline. L remains at the promised 2 as recent arrivals have stabilized around 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand ramp-up expected for late December. Ghost inventory (permanently lost shipments) remains confirmed at 637 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the critical holiday peak period (Dec 23). Historical data from July showed a massive surge, and December is expected to follow a similar seasonal spike for accessories. Recent demand (P44-P45) has been low, but this typically precedes a final holiday rush. The main challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory: out of 1051 units in-transit, 637 units (from P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, while the OR engine incorrectly thinks they satisfy future demand. The genuine pipeline is approximately 414 units (P38, P44). To force the backend to order enough to cover the holiday spike and the start of January, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. This value (1187) is calculated to cover 3 periods of expected high demand (avg 150/week based on the July peak) plus the 637 'ghost' units that must be bypassed in the backend's base_stock calculation (150*3 + 637). L=2 is maintained as the standard lead time, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the end of December (Period 47, 2019/12/30). Historically, December demand has shown high variability with peaks around the holidays (Period 44 demand was 10, but historical spikes in other seasons suggest potential for recovery). The 'In-transit' system shows 1235 units, but 637 of these are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from long-lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). Genuine pipeline inventory consists of orders from P44 (240 units) and P46 (184 units), totaling 424 units. The OR engine incorrectly sees the full 1235 units, which would normally block it from ordering. To ensure the backend places an order for the coming periods (post-holiday/early Jan), I must inflate mu_hat to account for the 637-unit ghost inventory gap. Lead times recently varied between 2-3 periods; I will stay with the default promised lead time of 2 for the backend logic. Demand has averaged around 25-50 units recently, but with the ghost inventory offset, I will explicitly set mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the ghost inventory threshold to trigger replenishments.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Total ghost inventory remains 637 units (P1, P3, P10, P24, P25, P26). Genuine in-transit is 424 units. System reporting (1235) significantly overestimates availability.
