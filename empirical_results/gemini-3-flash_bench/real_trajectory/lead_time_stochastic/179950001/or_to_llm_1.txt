Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is currently 0. In Period 1, there was a demand of 40 units, but because the starting on-hand was 0 (and the Period 1 order arrives in Period 3), we experienced a stockout with 0 units sold. Total 'In-transit' is 109 units (the Period 1 order). Historical demand samples are 105, 62, 72, 48, 36, and now 40 in Period 1.

Given that we currently have 0 on-hand and 109 in the pipeline for Period 3, an additional order of 103 units ensures we have enough stock for Period 4 and beyond, especially considering we are starting with a deficit due to the initial stockout.

The order from P1 (109 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 3 and will be visible at the start of Period 4. Demand Analysis: Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 64.6 units (105, 62, 72, 48, 36). Recent realized demand in P1 (40) and P2 (87) averages 63.5 units. There is no strong seasonal evidence yet for 'Austin basic leather hip belt' in late February. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 54 units based on a base-stock level. However, given the 2-period lead time, we must cover demand for P3, P4, and P5 (L+1 = 3 periods). Estimated demand for 3 periods is ~192 units. Our current pipeline (212) theoretically covers this. However, since we have 0 on-hand and have been stocking out, we need to ensure we don't fall behind if P1 or P2 orders are delayed or if demand spikes.

However, since we have persistent stockouts (Sold=0 in all prior periods due to 0 on-hand), and the first shipment from P1 is expected to arrive this period (P4), we must be cautious.

The order from Period 1 (109 units) should have arrived during Period 3 (L=2) but has not concluded yet, suggesting it might be delayed or lost. 2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: Current on-hand is 42. In-transit is 163 (likely the missing 109 from P1 and 54 from P3). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 61 units over the last 4 periods (40, 87, 57, 61). 3. **OR Recommendation**: The OR recommendation is 48 units. However, the OR agent assumes all in-transit inventory will arrive. If the P1 order (109 units) is indeed lost, we face a major stockout risk in 1-2 periods. 4. **Strategy**: I will follow the OR's recommendation of 48 units. While there is a risk of a lost shipment (P1), the 'In-transit' count still reflects these units. Adding more inventory now while having 163 units 'in-transit' risks high holding costs if the P1 shipment is merely delayed rather than lost. 48 units maintains a pipeline that aligns with the mean demand of ~60 units while respecting the OR's capped safety logic.",

Let's break down the pipeline: The 228 units consist of the lost P1 (109) and P3 (54) orders, plus the P8 order (65). Total reliable pipeline is only 65 units (from P8, expected to arrive around P10 or P11). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand since P1 is 40, 87, 57, 61, 98, 50, 57, 47 (Average ~62). The product is a basic leather hip belt, which has relatively stable demand but suffered stockouts in P5, P6, and P7. 4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it sees 228 in transit. However, 163 of those (P1+P3) are lost. Reliable total (On-hand 152 + Reliable Pipeline 65) = 217 units. With an average demand of 62, this covers roughly 3.5 periods. To cover the lead time (L+1=3) plus safety stock, we are currently at a safe level, but slightly above the mean.

However, the P13 (55 units) and P14 (60 units) orders are now past their promised delivery window and haven't 'concluded', raising a high risk of stockouts if these are lost like previous early-period orders. 4. OR Review: The OR recommends 0 because its formula sees a pipeline of 498 against historical demand.

This is likely seasonal for the 'Austin basic leather hip belt'. 4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the unadjusted in-transit figure (416).

Total lost/missing units = 516. The 'reliable' pipeline consists only of orders from Period 23 (80) and Period 24 (30), totaling 110 units. Total reliable inventory (on-hand 116 + reliable pipeline 110) = 226 units. Recent demand has cooled from the peak of ~138 down to ~60. For the next three periods (Lead time 2 + 1 review), I estimate demand at approximately 180-210 units. OR recommends 0 because it treats all 626 units as arriving soon. While on-hand and reliable pipeline technically cover the expected demand, safety stock is minimal given the supplier's history of losing orders. However, with 116 on-hand and 80 expected to arrive (ordered P23, likely to arrive P25 or P26), I am well-covered for the immediate future.

The P26 order (80 units) is 3 periods old and is expected either now or in the next period. The P28 order (85 units) is 1 period old. Final Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it sees 711 units in-transit. Adjusting for lost shipments, our 'Reliable Pipeline' is ~165-195 units against a weekly demand of ~80.

Following a low-demand regime starting in Period 38 (approx. 40 units/week), Period 42 saw a massive spike to 227 units. This corresponds to the final week of November, likely driven by Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales in the 'Womens Big accessories' category. While the seasonal peak has passed, the current on-hand inventory of 87 units is low for a L=2 lead time environment. The 'In-transit' figure of 1116 units is extremely misleading due to approximately 916 units identified as lost in Carry-over insights (Periods 1, 3, 13, 14, 17, 19, 24, 26, 29, 33, 34). Therefore, the reliable pipeline is only 200 units (orders from P38, P40). I will order 120 units to rebuild inventory levels and protect against any late-season demand or further shipment losses, as the OR recommendation of 0 incorrectly assumes the 1116 units in-transit are coming and that recent demand follows the long-term empirical mean.",

This leaves a 'reliable' pipeline of roughly 240 units (the order of 120 from Period 38 which is extremely overdue and likely lost, the 120 from Period 43). \n\nLead Time Analysis: The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual arrival data shows high variance (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). \n\nDemand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile. Period 42 saw a massive spike to 227 (Black Friday), and Period 43 settled at 87 units. The pre-holiday average was ~40, but December (Period 44) typically sees sustained gift-giving interest for accessories like leather belts. \n\nDecision: The OR recommendation is 0 because it doesn't account for the massive amount of lost inventory in the 'In-transit' figure; it assumes the pipeline is full. Even if the Period 43 order (120 units) arrives in Period 45 or 46, current on-hand (80) is barely enough to cover one period if demand remains at the Period 43 level (87).

Reliable Pipeline: Total In-transit (1306) - Lost (916 confirmed + 120 from P38) = 270 units. These 270 units consist of orders from P44 (120) and P45 (150). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been 227 (Black Friday), 87, 108, and 104. The average demand over the last three weeks is approximately 100 units. The date is 2019/12/23, indicating the peak Christmas/holiday week. Demand is expected to remain high (estimated 100-120) before a post-holiday drop in January. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely based on the inflated system 'In-transit' figure.
