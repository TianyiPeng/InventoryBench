No arrivals were expected in Period 1. \n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: Current on-hand is 0. Demand in Period 1 was 24, which resulted in 24 lost sales because the starting on-hand was 0. The historical demand samples (6, 4, 20, 14, 18) and the Period 1 demand (24) show an upward trend or higher average than the early samples. The average demand across these 6 points is approx 14.3. \n3. **OR Recommendation**: The OR recommends 28 units based on a base-stock policy. Given the lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover Period 2, 3, and 4 demand. Total demand over 3 periods at an average of 14-20 units/period is roughly 42-60 units. \n4. **Final Strategy**: Pipeline inventory is currently 25 (from Period 1). Total needed is ~50. 50 - 25 = 25 units. The OR recommends 28, which aligns well with covering the ongoing demand and building a small safety stock.

The order from Period 1 (placed 2019-02-11) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the Period 3 conclusion. Currently, both Period 1 and Period 2 orders (total 53 units) are in-transit. No orders have concluded yet, so I assume the promised lead time of 2 is accurate for now.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (6, 4, 20, 14, 18) and recent demand (P1: 24, P2: 29) suggest an upward trend or a higher regime than the earliest samples. The average of the most recent 4 data points (14, 18, 24, 29) is ~21.25. The OR agent uses a base-stock policy but is capped and uses simple historical averages. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 53. Demand is currently outstripping the initial orders, leading to lost sales (sold=0 while demand=24 and 29). \n4. Strategy: I need to cover demand for Period 3, 4, and 5 (L+1 = 3 periods). Assuming a mean demand of ~25-30, I need ~75-90 units in the system. Current pipeline is 53. Period 1's 25 units should arrive this period to satisfy some of Period 3's demand, but since it happens after my decision, I must look at the total position. Following the OR recommendation of 23 units brings total units to 53 + 23 = 76, which is on the lower end if demand remains near 30. However, the OR cap is designed to prevent over-ordering.

The historical samples (Jan 7 - Feb 4) ranged from 4 to 20, suggesting we have entered a new high-demand regime, likely due to seasonal interest in the 'Divided Collection' denim as spring approaches. \n2. **Inventory & Lead Time**: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 76 (Orders from P1=25, P2=28, P3=23). The promised lead time is 2 periods. For the P1 order (placed P1), it should arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. However, the P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. \n3. **Stockout Risk**: We are currently in a total stockout state with 0 sales made despite high demand (95 units missed in P3). We need to aggressively build inventory to capture this demand shift. \n4. **OR Recommendation Reconcile**: OR recommends 75. It uses a mean demand calculation that includes the low Jan/early Feb figures. Given the P3 demand of 95 and the likely lead time of 3+ periods, the current pipeline of 76 is insufficient to cover the next 3-4 periods of demand if the 95-unit level persists.

This is a clear upward regime shift likely tied to the spring season for denim trousers. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 176 units based on L=2. However, the OR agent doesn't account for the lost P1/P3 units or the exponential demand growth. Strategy: We need to cover demand for Period 6, 7, and 8 (L+1).

The average demand over the last 5 periods (including historical context) is roughly 284 units. The massive spike to 578 in Period 8 suggests a seasonal peak or trend for this denim product in early April. \n2. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is currently 0. In-transit is 273 units (Period 4 order of 75 and Period 3/lost orders of 25+23 are discounted; Period 8 order of 150 and Period 9's incoming expected amounts). Wait, In-transit is reported at 273. Based on history: P1(25) lost, P3(23) lost, P4(75) in-transit?, P8(150) in-transit. That adds up to 273 if P4 is still in transit (6 periods late). \n3. **Lead Time**: Inconsistency continues (1-2 periods). Orders from P1, P3, and now likely P4 (ordered 5 periods ago) are lost/unreliable. \n4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 396 units based on a base-stock policy. However, the current demand spike (578) and the high loss rate for older orders mean the pipeline is less reliable than the '273' figure suggests. If P4 (75 units) is lost, effective pipeline is only 150 units (the P8 order). \n5. **Strategy**: I will increase the order beyond the OR recommendation to 420 units to build some safety stock against the current high demand regime and the high probability of shipment failure/loss observed in the history.",

The 'Divided' collection (high-waist jeans) typically sees a spring peak, which we are now moving past. The 'softening' noted in Period 12 is confirmed as demand stays below the high 200s.\n3.

The current reported 'In-transit' of 584 units includes these 123 units, meaning the effective pipeline is actually 461 units (340 from P10, 0 from P11, 121 from P12). 2. **Inventory Status**: On-hand is 0. Demand in P13 (127) exceeded starting inventory (87), resulting in a stockout. We are currently waiting for the P10 order (340 units) to arrive, which should occur this period (P14) based on a 4-period lag from order to conclusion visibility (following the arrival of P8/P9 in P10). 3. **Demand Analysis**: Post-peak demand has stabilized.

Specifically, looking at the history: P20 arrived in P22 (LT=2), P21 & P22 arrived in P23 (LT=2 & LT=1). The order from P24 (180 units) is the only one currently in transit that is within a normal lead time window. Consequently, the 'Effective In-transit' inventory is 180 units, not 1,183. Demand has stabilized in a regime of 100-180 units per period (average ~140). With 107 units on hand and 180 units expected from P24, the total effective stock/pipeline is 287 units. To maintain safety stock over the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) at a 140/week demand rate, we need approximately 420-500 units.

Orders from P30 and P31 successfully arrived in P32 (LT=2 and LT=1 respectively), which resolved a temporary stockout risk. \n\nDemand Analysis: Demand for these jeans has stabilized in a regime of 130-160 units per period over the last month. Current on-hand (293) plus the incoming P32 order (180 - expected in P33/P34) totals 473 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of demand (Safety Stock inclusive). \n\nOR Strategy & Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely counts the large (but lost) 'In-transit' volume as available supply.

Over the last five periods, demand has dropped significantly (72, 53, 79, 56, 47, 24), with the most recent observation at only 24 units. This is a sharp decline from the previous stable range of 120-150 units. CURRENT INVENTORY ANALYSIS: On-hand inventory is 298 units. Based on a 5-period moving average of approximately 56 units, the current stock covers more than 5 periods of demand. PIPELINE ANALYSIS: While 'In-transit' shows 1,513 units, previous carry-over insights confirm that the vast majority of this (at least 1,723 units previously accounted for) consists of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. However, even disregarding the unreliable pipeline, the on-hand stock is excessive for the new demand level. STRATEGY: Maintain a zero-order policy to allow on-hand inventory to deplete toward a level aligned with the lower demand. The OR recommendation of 0 units is correct given the high on-hand balance and low demand trend.",
