Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11). Historical demand samples show: 6, 4, 20, 14, 18. This represents an average of 12.4 units/week. The product is 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS', a style of high-waist jeans. Looking at the dates, we are moving further into the spring season when denim sales typically remain steady or increase. The recent demand (last 3 periods: 20, 14, 18) suggests a higher mean than the full sample set. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this recent increase. Given the low number of samples and the jump from single digits to high teens, I'll use the default sigma calculation to maintain a safe service level during this period of high variability. Lead time is promised at 2 periods, and with no history of arrivals yet, I'll use the default method.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a pair of high-waist denim trousers from the 'Divided' collection, likely targeting a trend-conscious demographic. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) shows an upward trend (6, 4, 20, 14, 18), and the most recent demand (Period 1) was 24, resulting in a stockout since on-hand was 0. Currently, 30 units are in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, these are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in P4 start). To address the stockout and the rising demand trend, I select mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent regime shift (averaging 18, 14, 24). Since lead time observations are not yet available, I use the 'default' promised lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increased volatility seen in the last three data points.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand history for this SKU (640021005 - Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) shows samples of 6, 4, 20, 14, 18, followed by recent demand of 24 (P1) and 29 (P2). There is a clear upward trend in the last four weeks (14, 18, 24, 29). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a total of 57 units in-transit (30 from P1, 27 from P2). Promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order (30 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the recent demand regime is significantly higher than the initial samples, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher mean demand (avg ~21.25) and ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand. For L, I will stick with the promised 2 periods for now as no order has concluded yet to prove otherwise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a pair of high-waist denim trousers, which often sees increased demand as spring begins. Looking at the history, there is a massive demand surge starting in late February/early March: demand increased from stable levels (~20-30) in February to 95 in Period 3 and 174 in Period 4. This likely reflects a seasonal shift or the 'Divided' collection's popularity. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and I have lost sales due to stockouts in Periods 1-4. The lead time is confirmed at 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). I have 131 units in-transit (orders from Period 1, 3, and 4). To address the massive demand increase, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the upward trend since mid-February. I will set L to 'default' (2) as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the higher volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift detected starting Period 3 (2019-02-25); demand rose from ~25 to 95-174 units per period (+300%+).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a 'Divided Collection' denim trouser, which is experiencing a massive demand surge. Historical demand moved from ~25 to 95, 174, and most recently 254. This aligns with spring fashion seasonality for the 'Divided' (younger/trendier) demographic. We are currently out of stock (on-hand 0) due to this unexpected spike. Lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). The Period 1 order (30 units) is missing and potentially lost, but the Period 3 (26), Period 4 (75), and Period 5 (219) orders (Total 320 in-transit + 30 missing = 350) should begin arriving starting this period. To handle the regime shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the 95-254 trend, and sigma_hat explicitly high to account for the extreme volatility observed during this breakout phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: Demand grew from 95 (P3) to 254 (P5), suggesting a strong seasonal breakout for spring denim. Period 1 order (30 units) is 3 periods overdue, likely lost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS', a spring denim item. Current on-hand is 46 with 439 in-transit. Demand analysis: History shows a massive regime shift starting Period 3 (2019-02-25) where demand jumped from ~25 to 95, then peaked at 254 (P5) and sat at 173 (P6). The mean of the last 4 periods is ~174 units. Lead time analysis: P2 order arrived in 2 periods (P4); P5 order arrived in 1 period (P6). The P1 (30 units) and P3 (26 units) orders haven't arrived after 5 and 3 periods respectively, confirming They are likely lost. The P4 order (75 units) is now 3 periods out (overdue based on P5's 1-day lead time). I will use a 3-period window (P4-P6) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand spring state (avg ~200). For L, I will stick to 'calculate' as lead times are volatile (mixing 1 and 2), allowing the backend to average known arrivals. This setup targets a high service level for this high-margin ($19 profit vs $1 cost) trending item.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 (26 units) and Period 4 (75 units) orders are likely lost or delayed beyond 3 periods; In-transit counts are inflated by these missing units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (denim trousers) is in a high-demand spring regime. Recent demand (P3-P7: 95, 174, 254, 173, 243) averages ~188 units/period. The pipeline inventory (688 units) is heavily inflated by likely lost orders from Period 1 (30 units), Period 3 (26 units), and Period 4 (75 units), totaling 131 units that are at least 4 periods old (promised lead time is 2). In-transit units that are realistically expected to arrive are the orders from P6 (308) and P7 (249). The on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the necessary base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (3 * 188 \u2248 564 units). However, because the backend subtracts the full pipeline (688) from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. To cover next period's demand (~240) and account for the 131 units of lost stock, I'll set mu_hat to 800 and sigma_hat using a recent_N to handle the high volatility of this seasonal spike.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 131 units (Orders P1, P3, P4) that are significantly overdue (>3 periods) and likely lost. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime average of ~190 units/period since P4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 8, 2019. Demand for this denim item peaked at 578 units in Period 8, likely due to a seasonal spring surge or sales event, following a stable high-regime average of ~190. Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory (426) consists of Period 8's order (295) and the likely 'ghost' units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (30+26+75 = 131) which are now 4-7 periods overdue and almost certainly lost. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P5 and P7 arrived in 1, P2 and P6 in 2). Because the 'lost' units inflate the pipeline, the OR backend's capped policy will under-order unless I use 'explicit' values to bypass the 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction of these ghost units. I will set mu_hat to cover the high demand regime (~250/period) over (L+1) periods. L is estimated at 2 to be safe. mu_hat = (2+1) * 250 = 750. sigma_hat reflects the high variance seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment loss confirmed for orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 131 units); these units remain in In-transit but have not arrived after 5+ periods. Seasonal demand reached a peak of 578 in late March/early April.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '640021005' consists of high-waist denim trousers, which exhibit high seasonality in spring. We are currently in Period 10 (2019/04/15). Historical demand shows a significant spike in Period 8 (demand: 578) followed by a sharp normalization in Period 9 (demand: 216). This indicates the peak seasonal surge likely occurred in late March/early April, and demand is now stabilizing at a lower but still substantial 'high-season' baseline. The carrying insights confirmed that 131 units (orders from P1, P3, and P4) are lost and will not arrive. Pipeline inventory is currently reported as 866, but adjusting for these 131 lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 735 (440 from P9 and 295 from P8). With L=2, the order + pipeline + on-hand needs to cover 3 periods of demand. Given recent data, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 6 periods (P4-P9), which covers the post-shift regime (avg ~275). Using N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this sustained higher demand while softening the extreme peak of P8. L=2 is maintained based on the average observed lead time for successful arrivals (P2, P5, P6, P7).

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime identified: Following the seasonal peak of 578 in P8, demand settled to 216 in P9, suggesting a stabilization around 200-250 units for the remainder of spring.

Recent demand for the last two periods was 216 and 183, suggesting a new stable regime around 200 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 521) still contains 131 units from P1, P3, and P4 that are definitively lost. Netting these out, the functional pipeline is 390 units (from P10). On-hand inventory is healthy at 552 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P9 arrived in 1, P8 arrived in 2). Given the on-hand stock and the expected arrival of the P10 order, we are well-positioned. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P8-P10) to capture the trend of stabilization after the peak, and keep the lead time at the promised 2 periods to ensure the OR backend calculates the base stock across the appropriate window.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. Demand for 'Perrie Trash HW Denim' (a spring denim item) has cooled from its late-March peak (578) and mid-April levels (183, 216) to 138 in Period 11. This indicates the seasonal peak has passed and demand is descending toward a late-spring baseline. Lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P8 orders arrived in 2 periods, while P9 arrived in 1). I will maintain L=2 to be safe against lead-time drift. The 'In-transit' count of 1050 includes significant ghost inventory from lost orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 (total 131 units) plus more recent orders from P10 (390) and P11 (529). Since the OR backend uses a pipeline inventory subtraction (on-hand + in-transit), the 131 lost units will artificially suppress new orders. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: I'm forecasting a mean demand of ~150 units per period for the next 3 periods (L+1), totaling 450. However, to 'bypass' the 131 units of lost pipeline inventory and the high on-hand (414), I will set mu_hat to 1000. This ensures the base_stock (roughly mu_hat + safety stock) remains comfortably above the current (on-hand + effective pipeline) to trigger a replenishment that reflects current demand needs without being stalled by old lost shipments, while sigma_hat is set to reflect the recent lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak decline: Demand dropped from ~200 to 138 in P11, indicating a downward seasonal trend as spring progresses into May.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6th. Historically, the demand for this 'Perrie Trash HW Denim' (a spring/summer style) peaked in late March (P8: 578) and has been on a downward trend as early spring concludes. Specifically, demand in the last three periods has been 183, 138, and 162. I am setting the demand regime (mu_hat) to reflect this recent stabilization/decline using a recent_N of 3, resulting in a forecasted demand around 161 per period. Lead time remains erratic (ranging from 1 to 2 periods), but the backend's 'calculate' method will account for the confirmed arrivals. Note on Inventory: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (131 units total) are confirmed lost and still inflate 'In-transit' counts. Currently, there are 252 units on-hand and 1050 units effectively in-transit (though 131 are dead). The OR engine will use the capped policy to prevent over-ordering during this seasonal slowdown.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1759.00

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 13th. Historical demand data shows a clear seasonal peak for these denim jeans in late March/early April (P8: 578 units), followed by a steady decline as the season progresses (P9: 216, P10: 183, P11: 138, P12: 162, P13: 127). The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 152.5 units. On-hand inventory is currently high at 654 units, while 131 units in 'In-transit' (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed as lost, making the 'effective' pipeline inventory 390 units (from P10, ordered P10, scheduled to arrive P12, but still outstanding suggesting a possible lead-time drift or delay). Given the downward trend and high on-hand stock which covers roughly 4-5 periods of current demand, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the 150-unit regime, but the high on-hand and pipeline will naturally suppress new ordering. The L setting remains 'calculate' to account for the variation between 1 and 2-period actual arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-peak stabilization: Demand has averaged ~152 units over the four-week period (P10-P13) following the spring peak, confirming a seasonal transition to early-summer levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1686.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (May 20, 2019), the product (washed denim trousers) is in a post-peak stabilization phase following high spring demand. Recent demand (P11-P14) has been 138, 162, 127, and 117, averaging ~136 units/period. This is lower than the ~152 average observed in the previous four-week window, indicating a continuing seasonal cooldown as we enter late May. The current on-hand inventory is 537 units. In-transit inventory stands at 521 units, but 131 of these (from Orders P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost/overdue by many weeks. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 390 units (the order from P10 which has not 'concluded' yet, though P11 has). Since the expected lead time L is 2 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. 3 periods of demand at ~136/week is roughly 408 units. Our current on-hand (537) already exceeds this coverage. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 408 (3 * 136) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to account for recent volatility. L is set to calculate to use historical performance while keeping the logic stable. No new order will be triggered because on-hand + effective pipeline > base_stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime tracking: Late-May demand (P11-P14) has averaged ~136 units/period, down from the early-May average of 152, confirming a steady seasonal decline in spring denim demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/5/27. Demand in P15 spiked to 281, which is a significant deviation from the previous four-week average of ~136. This could indicate a late-May promotion or a specific seasonal clearing event for 'hard-worn' denim. Lead times remain mostly stable at 1-2 periods, excluding lost orders from P1, P3, and P4 (131 units total). Pipeline inventory is 521, but 131 are lost, meaning effective pipeline is 390. On-hand is 256. Total effective inventory is 646. Given the P15 spike, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the shift while acknowledging the previous downward trend. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical performance of arriving shipments. The OR backend will likely order a small amount or nothing as 646 units covers over 4 periods of the recent average demand (~150-160).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Intermittent demand spike observed in P15 (281 units), interrupting the previous seasonal decline. Assessing if this is a one-off or a new late-spring peak.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/3 (Period 17). The product is a distressed denim jean, typically associated with spring and early summer collections. Demand peaked in late March (Period 8: 578 units) and has since stabilized/declined. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged ~158 units per period, with a one-off spike in P15 (281) followed by a return to baseline in P16 (131). The the carry-over highlights 131 units in in-transit (Orders P1, P3, P4) that are definitively lost. Total In-transit is currently 521, but adjusted effective pipeline is 521 - 131 = 390. Note that since P12, no new orders have been placed due to high on-hand levels. Currently, on-hand (125) + effective pipeline (390) = 515. Using N=5 for demand (averaging P12-P16) gives a mean of ~164 units (excluding the outlier peak). With a promised lead time of 2, the (L+1) exposure period (P17-P19) requires approximately 492 units. The system should resume ordering soon to maintain service levels. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in actual arrivals (1-2 periods), and \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 to a recent N of 5 to capture the post-spring-peak stabilization while ignoring the anomalous P15 spike in the long-term trend, though 'recent_N' will include it mathematically.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/10. The SKU is 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS', a style of high-waist jeans. We are entering June, which typically sees a seasonal decline for heavier denim as consumers shift to summer attire. Demand history shows a peak in late March/April (P8: 578), followed by a stabilization/decline. Over the last four periods (P14-P17), demand has been 117, 281 (atypical spike), 131, and 125. Excluding the P15 outlier, the average is ~124 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit is 559, but history analysis confirms that orders from P1 (30), P3 (26), and P4 (75) are lost (total 131 units). Therefore, 'effective' pipeline is 559 - 131 = 428. These 428 units come from P10 (390 - though P10 conclude says ordered 390, no arrival yet after 7 periods suggests this order might also be lost or severely delayed) and P17 (38). However, looking at P10, it was 8 weeks ago. Given the lead time is 2, P10 is almost certainly lost. If P10 (390) is lost, the effective pipeline is only 38 units. Considering the high stockout risk (On-hand=0), I will set mu_hat based on the recent stable demand (excluding the spike) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Order from Period 10 (390 units) is 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost, similar to P1, P3, and P4. Total cumulative lost units in 'In-transit' = 521. Current effective pipeline is only the P17 order (38 units).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19 (2019/06/17), the current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0. History shows a massive inflation in In-transit units (715) due to several confirmed lost or severely overdue shipments: P1 (30), P3 (26), P4 (75), P10 (390). These 521 units are unlikely to arrive. The actual effective pipeline consists of orders from P17 (38 units) and P18 (156 units). Demand has slowed from the spring peak to an average of ~117 units over the last three weeks (P16-P18: 131, 125, 96). To ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order to cover the current stockout and the lead time, I will use an 'explicit' L value of 4. Although the promised lead time is 2, using L=4 compensates for the 521 'phantom' units in the pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly assumes are arriving, as the capped policy subtracts the full pipeline from the target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat (averaging ~110/period) to capture the current early-summer demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Effective pipeline confirmed at 194 units (P17, P18); 521 units in In-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10) are lost. Demand stabilized at early-summer levels (~110-120 units/period).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Demand has stabilized at early-summer levels, averaging 124 units/period over the last 4 weeks (P16-P19: 131, 125, 96, 142). The pipeline inventory is heavily inflated by 521 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' in its base-stock calculation. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be set to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage AND offsets the lost units. With L=2, (L+1)=3 periods of demand at 124 units/period equals 372 units. Adding the 521 lost units to this target yields an explicit mu_hat of 893 to ensure the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a correct order quantity. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture current volatility.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/7/1. Demand for this denim item has stabilized after the spring peak, averaging 113.3 units/period over the last 3 weeks (P18-P20). However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced a stockout (selling only 14 units against 102 demand in P20). Regarding pipeline inventory: out of 935 'In-transit' units, 521 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed lost as they are significantly beyond the 2-period lead time. Additionally, the order from P17 (38 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. The viable pipeline consists of P18 (arrived), P19 (296 units, 2 periods old), and P20 (80 units, 1 period old). Since P19 did not arrive in P20, we assume the lead time is at least 2 periods. To maximize service level and recover from the stockout, I use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent average demand (~115) across (1+L) periods, and keep L at the default promised lead time of 2. Sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Total cumulative lost units in 'In-transit' now estimated at 559 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P17 which is 4 periods overdue). Effective pipeline includes P19 and P20 only.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 8, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has entered a stable early-summer regime, averaging approximately 121 units over the last 4 periods (P18-P21). On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0). The 'In-transit' figure of 935 units is highly inflated due to multiple lost shipments: P1 (30), P3 (26), P4 (75), P10 (390), and P17 (38), totaling 559 lost units. The P17 order is now 5 periods overdue, confirming it is likely lost. The effective pipeline consists of P19 (296) and P20 (80), totaling 376 units. P19 was ordered in Period 19 with a promised lead time of 2, so it is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 21 or 22. To account for the 559 lost units without causing the OR engine to under-order due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I must adjust mu_hat or sigma_hat upward to compensate for the inventory gap, or use 'explicit' to force a base stock that ignores lost units. Setting L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, N=5 (P17-P21) gives an average of 124 units/period, so (1+L)*124 = 372. To offset the 559 lost units in a single SKU environment where the backend subtracts the full in-transit (935) from the base stock, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. Targeting a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand (~372 units) PLUS the lost units to allow the backend to place an order: 372 + 559 = 931. This ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock - in_transit' calculation yields a positive order to replenish the zero on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Shipment P17 (38 units) confirmed lost (5 periods overdue). Total cumulative lost units in In-transit = 559. Demand remains stable for summer at ~124 units/period (P17-P21 average).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23 (July 15, 2019), the 'Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS' is in a stable summer demand regime. Over the last six periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 127 units per period, with a slight increasing trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total In-transit value of 915 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms major losses: P1 (30), P3 (26), P4 (75), P10 (390), and P17 (38), totaling 559 lost units. Orders P18 and P20 have arrived. Currently, only the order from P19 (296 units) and P22 (60 units) are realistically in-transit, totaling 356 'effective' pipeline units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the inflated In-transit metrics, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to account for the current demand level (~127/week) and use 'explicit' L to keep the pipeline calculation grounded. Setting mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) at ~130 units/period = 390. This will prompt an order if the OR engine perceives the effective pipeline (356) plus on-hand (0) to be less than the target stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/22 (mid-summer). Demand has shown a slight uptick over the last three periods (P21-P23: 145, 152, 177) compared to the early-summer average of ~124 units. This suggests a potential late-summer peak or shift in demand. Inventory is currently stretched thin with 0 on-hand. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is significantly distorted by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (30), P3 (26), P4 (75), P10 (390), P17 (38), and P19 (296) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are well beyond the 2-period promised lead time. This totals 855 lost units, which matches the current In-transit figure exactly, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is zero. To trigger an order from the OR backend while it perceives a large pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that reflects demand for the review+lead window (3 periods) plus the total lost units to offset the backend's subtraction. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) captures the current volatility in this slightly higher demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Order P19 (296 units) confirmed lost (5 periods overdue). Combined with prior losses (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17), total cumulative lost units in In-transit = 855. Demand regime shift detected upwards from ~124 to ~158 avg over last 3 periods (P21-P23).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 (Denim Jeans) is currently in a summer demand regime. Demand in the last four periods (P21-P24) has been 145, 152, 177, and 104, averaging 144.5 units per period. This shows a slight upward shift compared to the early-summer average of 124, though P24 saw a dip. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 1343 is highly misleading due to significant lost shipments. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P1 (30), P3 (26), P4 (75), P10 (390), P17 (38), and P19 (296), totaling 855 lost units. The actual effective pipeline is only the P24 order of 488 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 2, I need to cover demand for Period 25 and the lead time window (P26, P27). My effective inventory position (OH 0 + Effective Pipeline 488) equals 488 units. Over (1+L)=3 periods, expected demand (3 * 144.5) is ~434 units. The backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering if it perceives the 1343 units in-transit as valid. To counteract the 'phantom' inventory in the OR engine and ensure arrivals to meet future demand, I use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the latest volume (avg ~145), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Effective pipeline verified at 488 units (order from P24). Cumulative lost units in In-transit reached 855 (sum of P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19). Current demand regime (P21-P24) averages ~145 units/period.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Aug 5, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has shown a slight upward shift in the last 4 periods (P22-P25 average ~148), likely due to back-to-school interest or late-summer denim shopping. Pipeline inventory is significantly inflated by lost shipments. Cumulative lost units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19) total 855 units. These units must be accounted for as they will never arrive. The only active order in the pipeline is from P24 (488 units). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the P24 order expected to arrive in P26 (this period) if lead time is 2, or P25 if lead time was 1 (it did not arrive in P25 conclude), we must assume the effective pipeline is 488 units. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 855 lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. My target base stock is (L+1) * 148 = 444. However, after accounting for the 'In-transit' phantom inventory of 855 units, the OR engine's internal calculation (base_stock - pipeline) would result in a massive negative number and no order. To force an order or maintain appropriate levels, I calculate the 'effective' demand needed to offset these 855 units. Specifically, I set an explicit mu_hat that represents what the OR engine needs to see to cover the actual demand plus the offset of the lost 855 units. Given the capped policy, I will set mu_hat to cover the next regime of demand while acknowledging the pipeline is actually much smaller than the 1343 units reported.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative lost units in In-transit confirmed at 855 (sum of P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19 orders). Effective pipeline is currently 488 units (from P24).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (2019/08/12), the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' count of 1343 units is highly misleading due to substantial historical shipment losses. Confirmed losses include P1 (30), P3 (26), P4 (75), P10 (390), P17 (38), and P19 (296), totaling 855 lost units. The actual effective pipeline consists only of the order from Period 24 (488 units). Since P24 was placed 3 periods ago and the promised lead time is 2, it is overdue; however, I will not mark it as lost yet. Demand has shown a recent upward trend as we move into August, with the last 3 periods (P24-P26) averaging 153 units (104, 161, 195). To restore inventory levels and account for the recent demand increase, I'm setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this latest regime. L is kept at 'default' (2) to align with OR backend logic, though I am monitoring P24's delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Effective pipeline remains 488 units (P24); cumulative lost units confirmed at 855. Demand regime has increased to an average of ~153 units/period over the last 3 periods (P24-P26).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (2019/8/19), the SKU is out of stock with 0 on-hand inventory. The In-transit figure of 1343 units contains a total of 855 confirmed lost units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 17, and 19. The order from Period 24 (488 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost as well, given the lead time history. Demand has shown a steady upward climb since Period 24, averaging 162 units over the last four periods (P24-P27: 104, 161, 195, 190). To capture this late-summer demand regime and compensate for the failure of the Period 24 shipment, I am setting mu_hat using a recent window of N=4 to reflect the 162 unit average. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful deliveries (approx 1.6 periods). We must place a significant order now to recover from the stockout and persistent shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Order P24 (488 units) is 4 periods overdue and is now highly likely lost, bringing total estimated cumulative losses in In-transit to 1343 units. Demand regime (P24-P27) has increased further, averaging 162.5 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August 2019. Demand for this denim item has stabilized at a higher late-summer regime, averaging approximately 161 units/period over the last 5 periods (P24-P28: 104, 161, 195, 190, 155). There is no inventory on-hand. The formal In-transit count is 1343 units, but my analysis confirms that the orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and now P24 (totaling 1343 units) are all significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time and have not arrived; they are effectively lost. This means the 'real' pipeline inventory is 0. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods using recent_N=5 to capture this recent demand level, and use explicit L=2 (promised) to trigger an order to refill the depleted stock. The sigma_hat is also calculated over recent_N=5 to account for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Order P24 (488 units) is confirmed lost (5 periods overdue). Total cumulative lost units in In-transit = 1343. Effective pipeline inventory is zero. Average demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is ~161 units/period.

The effective pipeline is zero. Demand over the last 6 periods (P24-P29) has averaged 155.1 units/period, showing a slight cooling down from the mid-August peak (195 units in P26). Given the consistent pattern of shipment losses (a high probability that any order sent will not arrive), I must continue to place orders to compensate for the effective zero pipeline. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current late-summer/early-autumn demand level (approx 155 units/period), setting L to the promised 2 periods to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock covering 3 periods of demand (~465 units). Since on-hand is 0 and the 1343 units in-transit are treated as units that will never arrive, the OR backend needs to place a substantial order to refill the pipeline which is effectively empty.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Order P24 (488 units) is 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total cumulative lost units in In-transit = 1831 (sum of P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). Effective pipeline remains zero. Demand has averaged ~155 units/period over the last 6 weeks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a state of 'stockout' with zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 1,343 units which are all confirmed lost (Orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. The OR backend will automatically subtract the 'In-transit' count from the calculated base stock; to force an order, mu_hat must be set high enough to overcome this ghost inventory. Demand has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P24-P30) with an average of approximately 157 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2, the 'on-order' target (base stock) should cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand plus safety stock. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 1,343 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 2,000. This covers the ghost inventory plus approximately 657 units of actual target inventory (covering roughly 4 periods of demand). Sigma remains based on recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' confirmed at 1,343 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). Demand regime (P24-P30) is stable at ~157 units/period.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Sept 16, 2019 (Period 32). In-transit inventory stands at 2,064 units. However, I have identified a massive 'ghost inventory' problem. Based on typical lead times (1-2 periods), orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, and P24 (totaling 1,831 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. The only valid shipment in the pipeline is the P31 order of 721 units, which is expected to arrive in P32 or P33. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a late-summer/early-autumn regime, with an average of 150 units/period over the last 10 weeks (P22-P31 avg \u2248 150.3). To protect against potential warehouse losses while accounting for the large P31 order now in transit, I am setting mu_hat based on the stable N=10 period average to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the 3-period risk window (L+1). L is maintained at the default promised lead time of 2, as recent successful deliveries (P20, P22) adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total ghost inventory in 'In-transit' confirmed at 1,831 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). Effective pipeline consists only of P31 order (721 units). Steady demand regime (~150 units/period) observed for the last 10 weeks.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 640021005 is currently in a steady demand regime after summer fluctuations, averaging ~150 units per period over the last 10 weeks (P23-P32). The most recent order (P31 for 721 units) arrived successfully in Period 32 with a lead time of 1 period, leaving 584 units on-hand for Period 33. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,343 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24), and is therefore ignored for planning. Since on-hand inventory (584) currently covers approximately 3.9 periods of demand (584 / 150), and the lead time is short (1-2 periods), no new order is required this period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stable demand mean and variance observed since the end of July, which accurately reflects the current 'Divided Collection' denim demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 30, 2019. Demand has been relatively stable over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), averaging approximately 154 units per period. The recent order from P31 (721 units) arrived in P32 (lead time of 1), providing sufficient on-hand inventory (407 units) for the current period. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,343 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24), which have not arrived despite many periods passing. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time for successfully delivered orders recently has been 1 (P31, P22) or 2 (P20). I will use a recent demand window (N=10) to reflect the stable late-summer/early-fall regime. Since existing stock (407) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the lead period (~150-160 units), the OR backend will likely not place a new order this period, which is appropriate given the current inventory level.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has transitioned into a stable autumn regime, averaging approximately 135 units over the last four periods (P31-P34: 131, 137, 177, 97). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 310 units. While the 'In-transit' figure shows 1343 units, these are all confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24) and must be treated as zero for planning. The effective pipeline inventory is currently zero. Since lead time (L) is 2, the current 310 on-hand units need to cover demand for Period 35, 36, and 37. At an average of ~135/period, 310 units will likely be depleted by P37. I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for recent stabilization and use an explicit mu_hat to signal the OR backend. I am keeping L at the default promised lead time as recent successful deliveries (P31) align with 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory in 'In-transit' remains confirmed at 1343 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). Demand regime (P31-P34) has stabilized at an average of 135.5 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. Demand has shown a steady decline as the spring/summer denim season ends, moving from a stable average of ~150 units/period (P24-P30) to an average of ~112 units/period over the last four weeks (P32: 137, P33: 177, P34: 97, P35: 72). This trend is consistent with seasonal clearance. The 'In-transit' figure of 1343 units remains comprised entirely of ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24), and the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 238 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of current demand trends (avg ~112). Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, and current inventory is sufficient for the immediate lead time window during a declining demand phase, I will set parameters to maintain a safe but lean stock level to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit) at the end of the season. I use N=4 for mu_hat to capture the most recent downward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Oct demand (P34-P35) averaged 84.5 units/period, compared to the Sept average (P31-P33) of 148.3, confirming the end-of-season decline for this SKU.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Demand for this denim item continues to show a significant late-seasonal decline. Over the last three weeks, demand has dropped monotonically: 97, 72, 53 units. The average for October (P34-P36) is ~74 units/period, down from the September average of ~148 units/period. On-hand inventory is 185 units, which covers more than 2 periods of current demand levels. The 'In-transit' figure of 1343 units consists entirely of 'ghost inventory' (orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24) which are long overdue and confirmed lost in previous Carry-over Insights. Effective pipeline is zero. Given the clear downward trend (53 units in P36) and sufficient safety stock (185 units), I am setting mu_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period average to avoid over-ordering during the phase-out of the spring/summer assortment. The lead time L remains at the default promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P31) arrived within that window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: October demand (P34-P36) averaged 74 units/period, a ~50% decrease from the September average (148.3), signaling the end of the product's primary seasonal cycle.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019. Demand for this SKU (Perrie Trash HW Denim) has entered a definitive end-of-season decline, following the transition from September (avg ~148) to October (avg ~75 over the last three weeks). The latest demand observation was 79 units, slightly above the October average but still reflecting the seasonal downward trend. Current on-hand inventory is 106 units. Given the declining demand regime, 106 units are likely sufficient to cover the next 1-2 periods of demand (expected ~60-70 units per period) without ordering more. The In-transit figure of 1343 is entirely composed of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24), and the effective pipeline is zero. However, since on-hand inventory already exceeds projected demand for the review + lead time window (L+1 = 3), no new order is required. Setting mu_hat to a recent_N of 4 (including the September tail and October values) to reflect the low-demand regime, and L to default.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for this denim SKU has shown a clear end-of-season decline throughout October. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 71.4 units, significantly lower than the September average of ~150 units. On-hand inventory is currently 50 units. Although 'In-transit' shows 1343 units, these are confirmed ghost units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). The effective pipeline is zero. Given the steady downward trend (P37: 79, P38: 56) and current on-hand stock, the goal is to maintain minimal stock to avoid end-of-season holding costs. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (71.4) to reflect the low-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the recent 5 periods to capture the reduced volatility of the lower volume. No new orders are likely needed as the current 50 units plus the calculated base stock should effectively wind down the season.

LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. We are in a clear end-of-season decline for this 'Perrie Trash HW Denim' SKU. Demand has been steadily decreasing through October and early November. The last four periods (P36-P39) show demand of 53, 79, 56, and 47, averaging 58.75 units/period. This is a significant drop from the September average of ~150. On-hand inventory is currently at 3 units, which is nearly depleted. However, we have 'ghost inventory' in the In-transit pipeline (1343 units from lost orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). Since the OR engine's 'base_stock' logic subtracts pipeline_inventory (which it believes includes these 1343 units), it will not place any new orders unless we adjust parameters. To ensure we have enough stock for the final 8 weeks of the game while demand is low (~50-60 units), and considering the promised lead time of 2 periods, I will set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the inflated pipeline issue. I'll estimate demand at ~60 per week. To account for the risk that new orders might also be lost (as has happened frequently), but not over-order at the end of the season, I will use an explicit lead time of 2 and mu_hat based on the recent regime. Note: The OR engine will subtract the 1343 lost units from our target, so if I want the engine to order, I must ensure 'base_stock' > 1343. Given the low demand, it is more efficient to stop ordering and let the SKU stock out, as profit margin ($19) versus potential holding costs and high loss risk makes aggressive restocking unattractive at the end of the lifecycle.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019 (Period 41). The SKU is a 'Tapered legs denim' product, which has shown a clear seasonal decline since its September peak. Demand has progressively dropped from ~150 to ~47 in Period 39 and 24 in Period 40. On-hand inventory is now 0. While there are 1,343 units in In-transit, these are confirmed 'ghost' units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24) and will never arrive. The effective pipeline remains zero. Given we are in late November and the demand is tapering off significantly, the goal is to satisfy the remaining low demand without over-ordering and incurring holding costs for stock that won't move before the season ends. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P38-P40) which average ~42 units per period to reflect the late-season volume. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead-time performance (usually 1-2 periods for successful deliveries), and sigma_hat will use the recent volatility (N=4) to account for the downward trend variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand trend confirmed in terminal decline phase (Avg ~42 units/period over P38-P40), following the October drop.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a terminal demand decline phase as winter approaches, consistent with the product description (worn denim/jeans) moving out of its primary spring/summer season. Demand has significantly softened, averaging approximately 30 units per period over the last three weeks (P39-P41). On-hand inventory is currently zero. All existing units in 'In-transit' (1343 units) are confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24), meaning the effective pipeline is also zero. Given the low and declining demand regime (avg ~30) and the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 47), the objective is to satisfy remaining demand without over-ordering. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to reflect this low terminal demand, and use a recent_N sigma to capture the reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand terminal phase confirmed; average demand for late November is ~30 units/period. All 1343 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed ghost inventory from lost orders.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its terminal seasonal phase (late November/early December). Period 42 demand spiked unusually to 78 units, likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotions, but the broader trend (P38-P42) averages ~47 units/period. On-hand and effective in-transit are zero (1343 units in In-transit are confirmed lost from orders P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24). With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P43-P47) and a 2-period lead time, any order placed now would only arrive for the final 2-3 weeks. I will target a 2-week stock level based on the recent terminal average (excluding the BF spike) to avoid holding costs on unsold end-of-season inventory. Setting mu_hat to represent a conservative forecast for the remaining window.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike in P42 (78 units) identified as a seasonal outlier (Black Friday); base terminal demand remains low at ~30-45 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 640021005 (Perrie Trash HW Denim TRS) is in its terminal seasonal phase as of Period 44 (Dec 9). After a brief Black Friday spike in Period 42 (78 units), demand has returned to a low baseline of 25 units in Period 43. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P40-P43), including the outlier spike, is approximately 39.5 units. Excluding the spike, the baseline is closer to 25-30 units. The In-transit inventory of 1343 units exclusively consists of ghost inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24) and should be ignored for decision-making. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is typically 1-2 periods, I need to order to cover the remaining periods of the game (ending at Period 47). I will set mu_hat explicitly based on the recent terminal average (~40 units/period) and L to 2 to ensure enough stock arrives to cover the end-of-game demand without over-ordering into a dead season.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Final seasonal phase confirmed. End-of-year demand baseline is ~25-40 units/period. All 1343 units in In-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in its terminal end-of-year phase (mid-December). Recent demand from P43-P44 has settled at very low levels (25 and 17 units, respectively), following a brief Black Friday spike in P42. The on-hand inventory is 0. The 1343 units listed in 'In-transit' are confirmed ghost inventory from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24) and should be ignored for replenishment logic. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P45, P46, P47) and a promised lead time of 2 periods, any order placed now would arrive in P47. Given the low terminal demand (~20 units/period) and the remaining game duration, I will set mu_hat to cover this baseline terminal demand for the remaining periods while using 'explicit' to bypass the ghost pipeline inventory. Setting L to 'default' (2 periods).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 23rd (Period 46), which is the final decision period (P47/48). The demand for this SKU (HW Denim) is in a terminal seasonal phase, with the last five periods (P41-P45) averaging 35.8 units/period, despite a small Black Friday spike in P42. The product is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 1343 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed ghost inventory from multiple lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P19, P24), and based on the game mechanics, the OR backend utilizes this 'In-transit' figure to calculate orders (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since 'In-transit' (1343) far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 35 unit/period demand regime, the backend will naturally order 0 units regardless of mu_hat/sigma_hat settings. However, to maintain statistical integrity for the final period, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent baseline (N=5, avg ~36) and sigma_hat to reflect the low volatility of this terminal phase.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (high-waisted denim) is in a terminal end-of-year seasonal decline. Period 46 demand was very low (8 units), following the established baseline of ~25-40 units observed since mid-November. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1343 units consists entirely of lost shipments from periods 1-31 and does not represent usable inventory. Given the current date is December 30th and demand is consistently dropping towards single digits, I will set mu_hat to a conservative explicit level reflecting the recent 3-week average (~18 units) to avoid over-ordering for a product clearly exiting its life cycle. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical lead time average (approx 1.6 periods) as recent shipments have generally arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Product is at the end of its lifecycle; Period 46 demand dropped to 8 units. All 1343 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed ghost inventory.
