  "rationale": "Product '678696001' is a women's sports t-shirt (fast-drying functional fabric). The current date is February 11, 2019. Historically (Jan 7 to Feb 4), demand started high (289) and stabilized between 122-201, with the most recent sample at 201. As we move into February and toward spring, demand for activewear typically increases or remains steady. Profit is high ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), justifying a higher service level. Promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods), I estimate a mean demand of ~180-200 units per week. Target inventory level (Order-Up-To) = (L+1) * Expected Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, I need to cover 3 periods. 3 * 200 = 600. Given zero on-hand and zero in-transit, I will order 650 units to account for potential spring demand growth and provide a safety buffer against the lead time.",

Analysis of the recent data confirms the SKU is at the end of its lifecycle: demand has dropped from ~200 units in April to single digits (0-6 units) throughout August. Specifically, Periods 26-28 saw demands of 0, 5, and 6 units respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 139 units, which at the current velocity (avg ~4 units/period) represents over 30 periods of coverage.
