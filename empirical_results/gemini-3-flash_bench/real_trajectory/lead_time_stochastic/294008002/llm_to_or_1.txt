Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is an H&M+ Cora tee, a fashion staple. Historical demand (5 samples: 43, 55, 46, 53, 59) shows a mean of 51.2 and a slight upward trend. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the first decision period, on-hand and in-transit are zero. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent demand level, and 'default' for lead time (L=2). The OR engine will target a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1) of demand, adjusted for the high holding cost relative to profit (q=0.5).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/02/18). The product is an H&M+ jersey tee. Historical demand samples (Jan 7 to Feb 4) are: 43, 55, 46, 53, 59 (Mean: 51.2). Period 1 demand was 66, which is a logic-consistent continuation or slight increase. Since on-hand inventory was 0, we had 66 lost sales. There are 63 units in-transit from the Period 1 order. With a promised lead time of 2, these are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in Period 4). For Period 2, we need to order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use the last 6 samples (including Period 1) to estimate demand. Mean of {43, 55, 46, 53, 59, 66} is 53.67. With L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*53.67 = 161. Standard deviation of these 6 samples is 8.16. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2)*8.16 = 14.1. I will set L to 'default' (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 3 (2019-02-25), we are managing a 'Gently flared top in soft viscose jersey'. Historical demand samples (Jan/Feb) show a steady increase: 43, 55, 46, 53, 59. However, the game history for Period 1 and 2 shows significantly higher demand (66 and 88 respectively), suggesting a late-winter/early-spring demand ramp-up as users shop for new jersey tops. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 131 in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order (63 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the Period 4 start message. The Period 2 order (68 units) is expected in Period 4. Total pipeline is 131. Given the sharp increase in recent demand (mean of last 2 game periods is 77), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (combining the last 3 historical samples and 2 game samples) to capture this rising trend while maintaining some stability. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen in the jump from 66 to 88. Lead time L is kept at default (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The item is a 'Gently flared top in soft viscose jersey', which is a spring/summer fashion item. Historical demand (5 samples) averaged around 51 units. However, current game demand (Periods 1-3) has jumped significantly (66, 88, 70), averaging 74.6 units. There is a stockout (On-hand: 0) because shipments haven't arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2. The Period 1 order (placed 2019/2/11) should arrive during Period 3 (2+1 delay) or 4. Per the timing rules, a Period 1 order with L=2 would arrive during Period 3 resolution and be seen at the START of Period 4. Since nothing is showing as 'arrived' in the Period 3 conclude message, the lead time is at least 3, or we are seeing characteristic shipping delays. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~75), and keep L at default for now while monitoring for the first arrival to confirm actual lead time.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019/3/11). The product is a 'Gently flared top', which fits the spring fashion season in March. Historical demand samples (late Jan to early Feb) averaged ~51 units/week. However, since Period 1 (starting mid-Feb), demand has surged to an average of 75.25 units/week (66, 88, 70, 77), representing a ~47% increase, likely due to spring seasonality. We are currently out of stock (ending on-hand=0) and have lost sales because arrivals are just catching up. The Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (L=2 as promised). The Period 1 order (63 units) is overdue and potentially lost, as it should have arrived in Period 3. To address the demand shift, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher sales trend and volatility observed in the last 4 periods. L remains at the default promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 1 (Feb 11): mean increased from ~51 to 75.25 units (+47%), likely due to early spring seasonality for jersey tops.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (March 18, 2019). The product is a jersey top, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand since Period 1 has averaged 73 units/period (66, 88, 70, 77, 64), confirming the regime shift from the early January average of ~51. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods. Lead time analysis: An order from P2 arrived in P4 (L=2), meeting the promised lead time. The order from P1 (63 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since P1), suggesting it is likely lost. The order from P3 (57 units) should have arrived in P5 (L=2) but did not, and is now 1 period late. With 226 units currently 'in-transit' (P1: 63, P3: 57, P4: 36, P5: 70), excluding the likely lost P1 shipment leaves 163 units in the pipeline. To restore service levels and handle the (L+1)=3 period demand window (estimated 3 * 73 = 219 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the current high-demand regime and 'default' for lead time, while mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated by the backend based on the last 5 samples.

Carry-over insight: P1 order (63 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed, promised 2). P3 order (57 units) is delayed by at least 1 period beyond promised lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (March 25). The item is a jersey top, which is entering peak spring seasonality. Demand since Period 1 has averaged ~73 units/period (66, 88, 70, 77, 64, 75). On-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline contains 156 units. Logistics assessment: 1) Period 1 order (63 units) is definitely lost (6 periods elapsed). 2) Period 2 order arrived on time (L=2). 3) Period 5 order arrived early (L=1). 4) Period 3 (57 units) and Period 4 (36 units) orders are significantly overdue. Because the 'In-transit' count ($156 = 57+36+63? 	ext{ No } 156-57-36 = 63$) still includes the lost P1 units, the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' is inflated by 63 units, which will suppress new orders. To fix this, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, calculating (1+L)*mean demand and then adding back the 63 lost units to the 'base_stock' target so the backend orders enough to cover the loss. For L, I'll use 2. Mean demand (last 6 periods) = 73.3. Target base stock for L=2 should be (2+1)*73.3 = 220 + safety stock. I will set mu_hat (explicit) to 283 (220+63) to force the OR engine to order despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Confirmed P1 order (63 units) remains in 'In-transit' but is lost; P3 and P4 orders are currently overdue. Adjusted mu_hat explicitly to compensate for pipeline inflation.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8 (2019/4/1), the product (H&M+ Cora tee) is entering the core spring season. Historical demand shows a clear shift starting Period 1, with recent demand (Periods 4-7) averaging 77.25 units, significantly higher than the initial samples. Lead time is highly volatile: P2 arrived in 2 periods (promised), P5 arrived in 1 period, while P1 (63 units) is confirmed lost, and P3/P4/P7 are currently in-transit. On-hand remains 0, leading to stockouts. The OR engine considers 'In-transit' as 265 units, but since P1 (63 units) is lost, the true pipeline is 202 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 350, derived from (1+L)*E[Demand] + lost_units. With L=2 and E[Demand]\u224882 (anticipating a spring peak), (3*82) + 63 \u2248 309; however, since P3 and P4 are also overdue, I'm boosting mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered despite the high 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Volatile lead times confirmed (P5 lead=1, P2 lead=2, P1 lost). Demand remains in the elevated spring regime (avg 77+). Pipeline inventory is artificially inflated by 63 units due to the lost P1 shipment.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 9 (2019/04/08). Demand context: The HM+ Cora tee is in a high-demand spring regime. Recent demand (P1-P8) average is 76.8, significantly higher than the initial samples (~51). We will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this. Lead time context: Observed actual lead times are 2 (P2) and 1 (P5, P7). The P1 order (63 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed, promised 2). This lost order artificially inflates the 'In-transit' count (241 units), of which 63 units will never arrive. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 63 to 'trick' the backend OR logic (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline) into ordering the missing volume. Current on-hand is 27. Demand is stable in the new regime, so I will calculate Forecast (L+1=3 periods) = 3 * 76.8 = 230.4, then add 63 to get an explicit mu_hat of 293.4. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Pipeline data remains corrupted by the lost P1 order (63 units). Lead time remains variable (mix of 1 and 2 periods). Demand regime (avg ~77) is stable for the spring season.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/04/15), we observe that the Cora tee remains in its high-demand spring regime (averaging ~75-80 units/week). The 'In-transit' figure of 267 units is critically inflated by the lost Period 1 order (63 units), which has now been missing for 9 periods. The current pipeline also contains orders from Period 3 (57 units, overdue), Period 4 (36 units, overdue), Period 8 (85 units, lead time likely 1-2), and Period 9 (26 units). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing stockouts, I must provide a mu_hat that triggers an order despite the inflated pipeline inventory. The OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock; if I set mu_hat to the expected demand across (L+1) periods (approx 240) and accounting for the 63-unit 'phantom' inventory, I need the base_stock to be higher to ensure an arrivals flow. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target that compensates for the lost 63 units and the current stockout streak, aiming for roughly 3 periods of coverage (L=2) at a rate of 78 units/period + the 63 unit offset = 297. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised duration, which remains the safest anchor despite recent 1-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: In-transit inventory remains inflated by 63 units from the lost Period 1 order. Demand regime is stable at ~77 units/week. Lead times are inconsistent (1-2 periods).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019/4/22). The demand for the Cora Tee continues in its elevated spring regime. While Period 10 saw a lower demand of 37, the average since the regime shift in Period 1 remains approximately 72 units per week. I'll use recent_N (N=10) to capture this regime. Lead times have been inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P5 lead=1, P7 lead=1, P8 lead=2, P9 lead=1). I will use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge this variability. The critical issue remains the lost P1 order (63 units), which is still counted in 'In-transit' (186 total - P3: 57, P4: 36, P10: 30 = 123 active; 186 - 123 = 63 lost). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage): 72 * 3 = 216. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (186) from the base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost amount (63) to neutralize the error. Adjusted mu_hat = 216 + 63 = 279.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 12 (2019/4/29). The product is a jersey top (HM+ Cora tee), which is seeing strong spring demand. Looking at the history, demand has remained in an elevated regime starting around Period 5, with an average of approximately 77 units per week over the last 7 periods (P5-P11). The most recent period (P11) saw a high demand of 108 units, so we must maintain a robust stock level. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P8 arrived in 2, P9 arrived in 1). The Period 1 order (63 units) is confirmed lost, as 11 periods have elapsed without arrival. This lost order is still 'In-transit' logically in the backend. Since the OR engine uses 'pipeline_inventory = In-transit + On-hand' to compute orders, we must offset the 63 units that will never arrive to prevent the system from under-ordering. Consequently, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 294, calculated as: ((1 + L=2) * mean demand of 77) + 63. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the phantom units in the pipeline. I will set L to 2 to be conservative against the recent variability and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the higher volatility seen in the spring regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019/5/6), we are managing a jersey top with a profit/holding cost ratio where q=0.5, implying a target base stock at the 50th percentile (the mean). The current demand regime (Periods 1-12) shows a mean of approximately 76.5 units per week, significantly higher than the pre-period average. However, the last two periods (P11-P12) saw spikes of 108 and 100 units, suggesting a potential further upward trend as we move into late spring/early summer. The lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 2 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P8 arrived in 2, P9 arrived in 1). Crucially, the 'In-transit' count of 294 is corrupted by the lost Period 1 order (63 units) and the missing P3 (57 units), P4 (36 units), and P11 (19 units) orders which are now overdue or lost. Total likely lost/stagnant pipeline = 63+57+36+19 = 175 units. Effective pipeline is actually ~119 units (P12 order). To force the OR engine to order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to cover the 3-period window (L+1) at the higher demand rate, while adjusting for the phantom inventory. I set L=2 to be safe given the delivery inconsistency.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Total pipeline corruption estimated at 175 units (P1, P3, P4, P11 orders likely lost or indefinitely delayed). Real pipeline is only the P12 order (89 units). Demand trend remains elevated (avg ~77 last 12 periods, spikes of 100+ recently).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 14 (May 13). Demand for this jersey top remains high (average ~77, recent spikes over 100). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 396 units, but this is heavily corrupted by lost shipments. 

Lead Time Analysis: Recent arrivals (P8, P9, P11) confirm an actual lead time of 1-2 periods. 

Lost Shipments & Pipeline Correction: Based on history, orders from P1 (63), P3 (57), and P4 (36) are definitively lost (all >9 periods old). The order from P12 (89) has not arrived (L=2 would be today). The order from P13 (121) is in transit. Total lost units in pipeline = 63 + 57 + 36 = 156 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 396 includes these 156 lost units, meaning the 'real' pipeline is 240 units (P12 and P13).

Parameter Strategy: To trigger an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' 396 units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the OR engine's (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. L=2 means 3 periods of demand. At 100 units/week, target is ~300. However, the OR engine sees 396 in transit. To force an order for ~80-100 units to maintain the cycle, I set mu_hat to 500 (representing the 'inflated' target to offset the 156 lost units).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption confirmed at 156 units (P1, P3, P4 lost). Real pipeline is P12 and P13. Demand remains elevated (~85 avg last 4 weeks).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Demand for this jersey top remains in a high-demand spring regime, averaging ~84 units over the last 5 weeks and peaking at 121 last period. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (411) is severely corrupted by lost shipments. Analysis of history confirms that orders from Periods 1 (63), 3 (57), and 4 (36) are lost, totaling 156 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline consists of P13 (121) and P14 (104). The OR backend uses the formula: order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). With a reported pipeline of 411 and a base_stock target around 250-300, the backend would order 0 without intervention. To force the OR engine to place an order that covers next period's demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat = 675 (calculated as: 411 reported pipeline + ~260 target inventory for L+1 coverage). This compensates for the 156 lost units and the 0 on-hand inventory, ensuring the backend places a necessary order for Period 15. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the most common recent arrival pattern.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in the peak late-spring/early-summer season for the 'HM+ Cora tee'. Demand has surged, averaging ~110 units over the last 3 weeks (108, 100, 91, 121, 126). The pipeline is severely corrupted. Total 'In-transit' is 675 units, but history shows Period 1 (63), Period 3 (57), and Period 4 (36) orders are definitively lost (156 units total). Furthermore, the P13 (121), P14 (104), and P15 (264) orders are still in the valid lead-time window. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' to subtract from the base stock. With 156 units lost, the backend thinks we have more stock coming than we actually do. To solve this, I will set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that incorporates both the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods and a 'phantom' buffer to cancel out the 156 lost units. Forecasted demand is ~110 units/week. For L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 weeks (~330 units). Adding the 156 lost units as a corrective buffer leads to an explicit mu_hat of 486. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover actual demand despite the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Pipeline corruption remains at 156 units (P1, P3, P4 lost). Real pipeline consists of P13 (121), P14 (104), and P15 (264). Demand regime has shifted higher into a summer peak, averaging ~110 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3), the demand for the Cora jersey tee is in a sustained high-growth phase, likely peaking due to summer seasonality. The average demand over the last 5 periods is ~116 units, with the most recent sample at 140. Pipeline corruption remains a critical issue: the In-transit total of 675 units includes 156 units definitely lost (P1, P3, P4). Furthermore, since P13 (121 units), P14 (104 units), and P15 (264 units) have not yet arrived (and P16 order was 0), on-hand inventory is empty. Lead times oscillate between 1 and 2 periods; I am assuming 2 to be conservative for safety stock. To account for the 156 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as 'in-transit', I will set \u03bc\u0302 to approximately 3 periods of demand (~348) PLUS the 156 lost units, totaling 504. This forces the base stock level (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory. Sigma is set to reflect the high volatility (34.0 std dev) seen in the recent summer regime (~60 for 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak confirmed: last 5 periods (P12-P16) avg 116 units, significantly higher than the spring avg of 77. Pipeline corruption verified at 156 units (P1, P3, P4).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 (June 10). The product is a jersey tee, currently in its summer demand peak. Demand over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) has averaged approximately 115 units, compared to the earlier spring average of 77. The pipeline continues to be corrupted by 156 units (Orders from P1, P3, and P4 which never arrived). In Period 17, the large P15 order (264 units) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, leaving 151 units on hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 411 includes the 156 lost units and the P13 (121) and P14 (104) orders, which are now overdue (placed in early May, 5-6 periods ago). Given the high frequency of lost or significantly delayed shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14), I will treat the 'real' pipeline as zero for this period and set mu_hat explicitly to provide a substantial safety buffer for the summer peak. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 120 = 360 units to cover the next 3 weeks of high demand, while sigma_hat is set high (70) to account for the extreme supply chain volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption confirmed at 381 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 now likely lost or indefinitely stalled). Summer demand regime (June) remains high, averaging ~115 units/week.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), we are in the middle of the summer demand peak for this 'Jersey Flare Top'. The demand average over the last 6 periods (P13-P18) is approximately 118 units, compared to the spring average of 77. The 'In-transit' balance of 411 units is heavily corrupted by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (63), P3 (57), P4 (36), P13 (121), and P14 (104) are all significantly past their promised lead time (2) and recent average lead time (2), totaling 381 phantom units. Subtracting these from the 411 reported units leaves a real pipeline of only 30 units (representing P15 remnants or order errors, though P15 arrived in full at 264 units). Since on-hand is only 33 and demand is ~118, we are at risk of stockout. To force an order despite the Orc-backend's inflated pipeline view, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 740, which is (1+L) * forecasted_demand + phantom_inventory (3 * 120 + 381 = 741). This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety) exceeds the 411 'In-transit' + 33 'On-hand' units, triggering the necessary replenishment for the summer season.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline corruption now estimated at 381 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 lost/stalled). Real pipeline is effectively zero or negligible. Summer demand regime (June) remains consistently high, averaging ~118 units/week.

The lead time remains consistently around 2 periods. The pipeline inventory of 685 is highly corrupted by lost shipments: P1 (63), P3 (57), P4 (36), P13 (121), and P14 (104) are all significantly overdue and likely lost, totaling 381 units. Subtracting these from the current 685 in-transit leaves 304 'real' units in transit (mostly the 274 ordered in P19). Since real pipeline inventory (304) is tracked against a required base stock for Summer demand, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the backend's automated (and corrupted) pipeline subtraction. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, targeting a service level for 136 units/week across L+1 (3 periods) requires approximately 408 units. However, to account for the 381 units of 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine will subtract from its order calculation, I must inflate mu_hat. Actual target base stock (3 periods * 136) = 408. Ghost inventory = 381. Therefore, mu_hat = 408 + 381 = 789. sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle the high demand volatility (IQR of recent demand).

Carry-over insight: Summer demand peak intensified: P16-P19 average demand is 136 units/week. Total confirmed pipeline corruption remains at 381 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 lost).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. The SKU (HM+ Cora tee) is in a peak summer demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P16-P20) has averaged 124.4 units/week, with significant volatility (high of 173, low of 78). The pipeline inventory of 789 units is severely corrupted by lost orders: P1 (63), P3 (57), P4 (36), P13 (121), and P14 (104) are all long overdue and confirmed lost, totaling 381 units. The 'real' pipeline consists of P15 (264 - though P15 arrived in P17, it should be cleared from in-transit, but the system shows 789 remains which indicates many old orders haven't concluded), P19 (274), and P20 (104). The high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($1) implies a 50% target service level (q=0.5), meaning we should aim to stock the mean demand exactly to avoid excessive holding costs. Due to the high pipeline corruption (381 units), I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean + corruption_offset to force the OR backend to place an order that covers the summer peak despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed summer demand volatility (P19=173, P20=78). Cumulative pipeline corruption is verified at 381 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Real pipeline is P19 (274) and P20 (104). Current date marks the start of July, expect high demand to persist for 4-6 more weeks.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), we are in the peak summer demand season for jersey tops. Recent demand (P19-P21) has averaged 110 units/week despite high volatility (173 vs 78). The 'In-transit' figure of 789 units is heavily corrupted: 381 units are confirmed lost/indefinitely stalled (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Real pipeline consists of orders from P19 (274 units) and P20 (104 units), totaling 378 units. The P19 order, placed June 17, should have arrived by Period 21 (promised L=2). Its absence at the start of Period 22 suggests it is delayed or potentially lost. I will set mu_hat to 390 (reflecting a 130 unit/week forecast for the next 3 periods) to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger replenishment given the massive pipeline corruption. sigma_hat is set high to account for recent demand volatility and shipment uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: P19 order (274 units) is now overdue (placed P19, promised L=2, not arrived by P21/start of P22). Real available pipeline is 378 units (P19, P20), while 381 units of the listed 789 in-transit units are confirmed lost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 15, 2019. We are in the mid-summer season. Demand has been high but volatile (P19=173, P20=78, P21=79, P22=52). The recent drop likely reflects stockouts or short-term variance rather than a permanent regime end. The pipeline is heavily corrupted by 381 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). In Period 22, the P20 order (104 units) arrived with L=2, but the larger P19 order (274 units) is now overdue (L=3+). This suggests either shipment loss or severe delay. Total in-transit is 685, but if we subtract the 381 lost units and the 104 units that just arrived, the remaining pipeline is 200 units (representing P19 which is 274, suggesting P19 is partially lost or there's a accounting mismatch). I will assume the 381 units are permanently lost. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the summer peak despite the corrupted pipeline view, I am setting mu_hat explicitly based on the recent high-demand regime (avg ~110-120) and using L=3 to account for the current delay in the P19 shipment. Increasing sigma_hat to 60 to protect against the high volatility seen in June/July.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: P19 order (274 units) confirmed overdue (L=4+ periods since ordering in P19). Cumulative pipeline corruption is now at least 381 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Real pipeline is likely just the P19 remainder, though it is increasingly probable it is lost. Demand volatility spiked in July.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 22, 2019. The 'HM+ Cora tee' (Jersey Fancy top) is in its summer peak. Demand analysis: The last 8 periods (P16-P23) have shown high volatility and a general downward trend from the late June peak (avg ~90 over last 4 periods vs ~118 previously). Lead time analysis: P20 arrived on time (L=2) in P22, but P19 (274 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. Pipeline analysis: Total In-transit is 685. Confirmed/suspected lost orders: P1(63), P3(57), P4(36), P13(121), P14(104), P19(274) = 655 units. The remaining 'real' pipeline is effectively 30 units (685 - 655). With on-hand at 0, a stockout is imminent and actual available inventory is extremely low. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (~90 units/week * 3 periods) to cover (L+1) demand, but I must also use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat because the OR backend's pipeline inventory count (685) is heavily corrupted by the lost units. By setting mu_hat higher, I force the OR engine to place an order despite the high reported (but mostly non-existent) in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Cumulative pipeline corruption increased to 655 units (confirmed losses: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14; new suspected loss: P19). Demand is normalizing to late-summer levels (~90 units/week).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (July 29), we are transitioning from peak summer demand into late summer. Recent demand has cooled significantly (P22: 52, P23: 68, P24: 39), averaging 53 units over the last 3 periods, down from the June average of ~118. In-transit inventory is listed at 925 units, but history shows severe pipeline corruption. Confirmed or highly probable lost orders include P1 (63), P3 (57), P4 (36), P13 (121), P14 (104), and P19 (274), totaling 655 units. Subtracting these from the 925 reported in-transit units gives an 'effective' pipeline of 270 units, which consists of the P24 order (240 units) and potentially some residual fragments. Given Profit=HoldingCost=1.0, the target service level is 50%, roughly aiming for the mean demand. Over a 3-period window (L+1), expected demand is approximately 159 units (53*3). Since the effective pipeline (270) already exceeds this, the OR engine should not place a large new order, but we must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the pipeline corruption. I set mu_hat based on the current 3-week average (~53 units/week * 3 periods = 159) to prevent over-ordering as the season winds down.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand has cooled significantly in late July, averaging ~53 units/week (down from >100). Total pipeline corruption is verified at 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19 lost).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5), demand for this jersey top has shifted from the summer peak (~115+ units) to a late-summer cooling phase. The average demand over the last four periods (P22-P25) is 58.25 units, down from the June/July highs. The pipeline inventory of 925 units is significantly corrupted by lost shipments. Confirmed lost orders include P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19 (63+57+36+121+104+274 = 655 units). Therefore, the 'real' in-transit inventory is 270 units (925-655), which consists of the P24 order (240 units) and the P10/P11 residual overhead. Lead times are averaging 2.0 periods based on recent successful deliveries (P15, P20). I will set L=2 and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current demand slowdown, while ensuring the OR backend's inventory calculation accounts for the real pipeline to prevent further stockouts as summer ends.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed pipeline corruption at 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19 lost). Late-summer demand cooling confirmed: average dropped to ~58 units/week since P22.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 27 (August 12, 2019). The demand for this jersey top has significantly declined from its summer peak (>110/week in June/July) to a late-summer average of approximately 56 units/week over the last 5 periods (P22-P26). The current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 925 units in-transit, but based on historical tracking, a significant portion is lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19 are definitively lost or stalled (total 655 units). The remaining 270 units in-transit consist of the P24 order (240 units) and potentially unidentified remnants. Even if we subtract the 655 lost units, the 'real' pipeline of 270 units is more than enough to cover the current demand regime (56 units/week) across the promised lead time (L=2). Ordering more now would likely lead to excessive holding costs as we transition out of the summer season. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the cooled-off demand state and letting the pipeline (once the OR engine subtracts on-hand + in-transit) naturally suppress further ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Late-summer demand regime (August) is confirmed at ~56 units/week, a 50% drop from the summer peak. Pipeline corruption remains at 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19 lost).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), demand for this jersey top has stabilized into a late-summer cooling regime, averaging approximately 56 units per week since Period 22. Historical patterns suggest this cooling will continue as we enter the transition to autumn. The pipeline remains severely corrupted: 925 units are listed 'In-transit', but the vast majority are likely lost shipments. Confirmed/suspected losses include Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, and 19 (totaling 655 units). The remaining 270 units in the 'real' pipeline are primarily from the Period 24 order (240 units), which is now overdue (L=4 vs promised L=2). Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, stockouts are just as costly as excess inventory; however, the massive backlog of potentially arriving orders (if they are delayed rather than lost) suggests a conservative ordering posture. I will set mu_hat based on the recent cooling trend (last 6 periods, N=6) and use a slightly higher L to account for recent arrival delays, while relying on the OR backend's capped policy to manage the risk of over-ordering against the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Late-summer demand regime (August/September) confirmed at ~56-60 units/week. Pipeline corruption remains at 655 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19 lost). P24 order (240 units) is now 2 periods overdue.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the demand for the 'HM+ Cora tee' has stabilized in a late-summer/early-fall regime, averaging approximately 58 units/week over the last 6 periods (P23-P28), a significant drop from the summer peak. The pipeline inventory of 925 units is heavily corrupted: 655 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19) are confirmed lost. Additionally, the P24 order of 240 units is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P24, promised P26 arrival), bringing total suspected loss to 895 units. The effectively active pipeline is likely zero. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current demand mean of ~60, I need to trigger an order. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat to handle the seasonal cooling and ensure the backend doesn't over-order based on past summer peaks, and 'explicit' L to reflect the severe delivery instability seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline corruption increased to 895 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and now P24 likely lost/stalled). Effective pipeline is near zero. Demand regime is stable at ~60 units/week.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the demand for this viscose jersey top has stabilized into a late-summer/early-autumn regime. The last 8 periods (P22-P29) show an average demand of approximately 57.5 units/week, a significant drop from the summer peak. The pipeline inventory data is severely corrupted. The reported 925 units 'In-transit' consists of orders from P1 (63), P3 (57), P4 (36), P13 (121), P14 (104), P19 (274), and P24 (240). Based on the promised lead time of 2 and historical behavior, P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19 (totaling 655 units) are confirmed lost/stalled as they are many weeks overdue. P24 (240 units) is now 6 periods since ordering (promised 2), which strongly suggests it is also lost or indefinitely delayed. To prevent the OR backend from 'starving' the on-hand inventory due to these phantom in-transit units, I must continue to explicitly increase mu_hat. Given the current demand (avg ~58) and L=2, a typical base stock would be ~174 units. However, with ~895-925 phantom units in the pipeline, the backend would order 0. I will set mu_hat to 1100 to force the backend to place an order that results in a net arrive-to-shelf volume of approximately 180-200 units (effective base stock).

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total pipeline corruption estimated at 895 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24 are all likely lost or stalled indefinitely). Real pipeline is effectively zero. Demand has stabilized at a late-season regime of ~58 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 31 (Sept 9). Current status shows on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 1100 units in-transit. However, based on history, significant pipeline corruption exists. Confirmed/strongly suspected lost orders include: P1 (63), P3 (57), P4 (36), P13 (121), P14 (104), P19 (274), and P24 (240). This totals 895 units. The remaining 'real' pipeline is the P30 order (175 units), which is scheduled to arrive between Period 31 and 33. The demand regime has cooled from summer peaks (>100) to a late-season average of ~56 units per week (P25-P30). Period 30 saw extremely low demand (25), suggesting further cooling as we enter September. I will set L=4 to account for recent arrival instability and ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to cover the persistent stockouts, while using mu_hat to reflect the cooled demand state (~55 units/week).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed late-summer/early-autumn cooling: demand avg for P25-P30 is 51 units/week. Pipeline corruption is stable at 895 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Only the P30 order (175 units) is considered active.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a summer peak (>100 units/week) to a late-summer/early-autumn regime, averaging 51 units/week over the last 6 periods (P25-P30). Pipeline inventory is severely corrupted; out of 1100 units reported, 895 units are verified as lost (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). The only potentially active order is P30 (175 units), which was expected to arrive in P32 but has not yet concluded. Given on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual lead time is volatile (averaging ~2 but with many lost shipments), I set L to 2. mu_hat is set to 153 using the recent_N method (N=6) to capture the current stable demand regime of ~51 units/week across the (L+1) horizon. sigma_hat is also set based on these recent 6 periods to reflect the lower but still present volatility of the autumn season.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 23, 2019. Demand has stabilized into an autumn cooling regime, averaging approximately 51 units/week over the last 8 periods (since late July). The P30 order (175 units) arrived in Period 32, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 115 units for the start of Period 33. The total in-transit quantity of 925 units is heavily corrupted: orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P24 (totaling 895 units) are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled, as they are all significantly beyond the promised 2-period lead time with no arrivals. Subtracting these lost units from the tracked in-transit leaves a 'real' pipeline of 30 units (discrepancy likely from accounting adjustments or very small residual orders). Given on-hand inventory (115) and expected demand (~51), we are currently overstocked for the immediate future. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods to reflect the cooling trend and use the default lead time. Sigma reflects recent variability (std ~16.5). The OR backend will likely place a zero order due to the high on-hand relative to the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed demand regime (Autumn) at ~51 units/week (P25-P32). Total pipeline corruption confirmed at 895 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24 lost). Effective pipeline is near zero.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 30, 2019. The demand regime has stabilized into an Autumn pattern following the late-summer cooling. For the last 9 periods (P25-P33), demand has averaged 53.6 units, showing consistent behavior. Pipeline corruption remains extremely high at 895 units, representing orders from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 19, and 24 which are effectively lost or stalled indefinitely. The on-hand inventory is 49 units. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). Given the stability of the current regime, I am using recent_N (N=9) for demand forecasting to capture the current mean of ~54 units. With a 3-period window (L+1), the target stock should be around 162 units. Since the backend sees 925 units in-transit (895 of which are lost), the capped policy would normally result in an order of 0. However, by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent regime, and using the default lead time, I aim to maintain the service level while accounting for the significant stock-out risk once on-hand inventory is depleted.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this jersey top has decreased as we enter autumn, with an average of 42.4 units/week over the last 5 periods (P30-P34). The current on-hand inventory is 33 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 925 units is significantly corrupted by historically lost or indefinitely stalled orders. Based on the Carry-over Insights, we confirm that 895 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Consequently, the actual effective pipeline is 30 units (925 total - 895 lost). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)). To ensure the backend places an order to meet the (L+1) demand requirement, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that offsets the 895 units of 'ghost' inventory. Forecasted demand for the current regime is ~42 units/week. With L=2, the required base stock would be ~126 units. To trigger an order despite the 925 'In-transit' units, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Real Demand * (L+1)) + Corruption. However, since the OR engine caps orders, I will set mu_hat to 200 to signal a moderate replenishment need while acknowledging the seasonal slowdown. Sigma is set to recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Confirmed demand regime (Mid-Autumn) further cooled to ~42 units/week. Cumulative pipeline corruption remains at 895 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Available on-hand (33) and effective pipeline (30) are low relative to demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, mid-autumn. Demand has cooled significantly, averaging ~42 units over the past 5 periods (P31-P35), consistent with the late-season product life cycle for a jersey top. Pipeline corruption is stable and confirmed at 895 units (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24 are lost). With 925 units listed as in-transit and 895 units lost, the 'real' in-transit inventory is 30 units (representing any stray volume from P30 that might not have been fully accounted for or simply the residual error in the tracking). On-hand inventory is 15. The total effective inventory (on-hand + real in-transit) is approximately 45 units. Given that the promised lead time is 2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (P36, P37, P38). At the current mid-autumn rate of ~40 units/week, we need a base stock of ~120 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 120 (3 * 40) and L to default (2). To fix the backend's calculation which subtracts the 'corrupted' 925 units from its order, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or rely on the fact that if I provide a large mu_hat, the backend will place an order. However, since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level targeted by the OR engine is 50%. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the recent low-demand regime (~42 units) and keep L at default.

Carry-over insight: Mid-autumn demand regime (Oct) confirmed at ~42 units/week (P31-P35). Total pipeline corruption remains at 895 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late October. Demand for this jersey top has significantly declined as part of a mid-autumn cooling trend. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P31-P36) is approximately 35.5 units, continuing the downward trend from the late-summer regime. Inventory levels: On-hand is nearly depleted (2 units). In-transit is severely inflated by 895 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Consequently, 'active' pipeline is effectively zero as no recent orders have been placed after P30. To normalize ordering, I continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 895 units of 'phantom' pipeline. Given the current low demand regime, I will forecast a weekly demand of 35 units. Total (L+1) demand is 3 * 35 = 105. To force the OR backend with a 105 base stock while it sees 927 units of inventory (2 on-hand + 925 in-transit), I set mu_hat to 105 + 895 = 1000. This ensures the backend perceives a need for stock regardless of the corrupted pipeline data.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'HM+ Cora tee' (SKU 294008002) has entered a late-autumn cooling phase, with demand averaging approximately 14 units per week over the last four periods (P34-P37: 16, 18, 13, 10). The In-transit count (998) is severely corrupted by historical lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24 totaling 895 units). Subtracting these lost units, the 'real' pipeline is 103 units, which consists of the Period 37 order (73 units) and a probable residue of 30 units from P30 that was never reconciled. Given the current date is late October, demand is significantly lower than the summer/spring peaks. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the inflated (corrupted) pipeline, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current 14 unit/week regime, and utilize the 'L' parameter to indirectly adjust for the phantom inventory. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*14 = 42 ensures a stable target base stock of approximately 42-50 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Real pipeline is 73 units (P37). Total pipeline corruption confirmed at 895 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Late-autumn demand regime (Oct/Nov) reached a new floor of ~14 units/week.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date is Nov 4, 2019. Demand for this jersey top has significantly dropped into a late-autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P34-P38) averaging 13.2 units/week. On-hand inventory is 64 units, which is ample against the current mean and even the weekly standard deviation (~3). Pipeline inventory is listed at 925 units, but as documented, 895 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24) are confirmed lost or indefinitely stalled. The effective pipeline is zero. Given the low demand and 64 units on hand, we are well-covered for the (L+1) period (approx 40 units needed at 2-period lead time). Mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N=5 to capture the stable low-demand floor while L is set to calculate to reflect the mix of 1-2 period lead times.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has entered a late-autumn/early-winter floor, averaging approximately 12 units/week over the last 5 periods (P35-P39). The product is a jersey top, which typically sees its lowest demand in Q4 compared to the spring and summer peaks observed earlier in the year. The current inventory position is 53 units on-hand, which is more than sufficient to cover immediate demand at this low rate. Regarding the pipeline, the In-transit figure (925) remains heavily corrupted by lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P24), totaling 895 units. The effective pipeline is zero as no recent orders are outstanding. Given that on-hand inventory is approximately 4-5 times the current weekly demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime and maintain a low base stock to minimize holding costs as we approach the end of the year.

Carry-over insight: Late-autumn/winter demand floor confirmed: average demand for P35-P39 is 12.2 units/week. Total pipeline corruption is confirmed at 895 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019, which is deep into the late-autumn/winter season for a jersey top SKU. Demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 10-15 units per week, with the last 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging 11.0 units. Pipeline health: The system reports 925 units in-transit, but 895 of these are confirmed losses (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). There are no active orders in the pipeline beyond these losses. On-hand inventory is 41 units, which covers nearly 4 weeks of demand at the current pace. To avoid over-ordering during this low-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent stable floor. Lead time is set to default (2 periods) as recent successful arrivals (P37) suggest standard fulfillment is operational despite previous losses.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019. Demand for this jersey top has settled into a low winter floor, averaging 10.4 units/week over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). On-hand inventory is 33 units, which provides approximately 3 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. In-transit inventory remains significantly inflated at 925 units, but 895 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). The 'real' pipeline is 30 units (representing the P30 order remainder from P32 or accounting adjustments), though functionally the system sees 925 units in-transit. Because on-hand inventory (33) already exceeds the required base stock for this low-demand regime (approx. 10 units/week * 3 periods = 30), no new order is necessary. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) captures the current winter demand floor. The backend's base-stock calculation will naturally result in a zero order as on-hand + (perceived) pipeline exceeds the target level.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand for this SKU (jersey top) has stabilized at a winter floor, averaging 11.2 units per week over the last five periods (P38-P42). The total in-transit quantity is 925 units, but 895 of these are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline is 30 units (from the Period 30 order of 175, only 145 arrived/accounted for, or P30/P37 remainders). However, the conclude messages show P37 arrived in full. The in-transit figure of 925 minus the 895 lost units suggests a real pipeline of 30 units. On-hand is 17. Total effective stock (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 47 units. Given the low demand regime of ~11 units/week, 47 units covers over 4 weeks of inventory. With L=2, mean demand (1+L) is approximately 33-40 units. Since current effective inventory (47) exceeds the base stock level for this low-demand regime, the OR engine will likely order 0. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand floor (N=5) and sigma_hat to reflect current stability to avoid over-ordering during this seasonal trough.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9), entering the final stretch of the game. On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 43 satisfied demand of 17 units. Demand for this 'H&M+ Cora tee' (Jersey top) has settled into a very low late-autumn/winter floor, averaging 12.8 units over the last 9 periods (P35-P43). Pipeline inventory is listed as 925 units, but 895 units are confirmed lost/stalled (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). A 30-unit order from Period 10 is also effectively lost given it's been over 30 periods. Thus, effective pipeline is zero. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I am setting L to 2 (promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the stable winter demand floor (~13 units/period), resulting in a base stock that covers approximately 3 periods of demand ((1+2) * 12.8 = ~38.4 units). sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Winter demand floor remains stable at ~13 units/week (P35-P43 average). Pipeline corruption remains at 925 units (all current In-transit balance is considered lost/non-arriving).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 (Dec 16), the demand floor for this jersey top remains very low, consistent with the winter season. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is 12.4 units per week. There is zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' balance of 925 units is confirmed as pipeline corruption (lost or stalled orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, and P30's excess). Because the backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (final_order = base_stock - pipeline), and the corrupted pipeline (925) vastly exceeds any reasonable base stock target for a demand of ~13, the backend will place 0 orders unless I intervene. To force an order and replenish on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the corrupted pipeline units as an offset: Target Base Stock (for 12.4 demand and L=2) is approximately (1+2)*12.4 + safety stock (~50 total). To overcome the 925 unit subtraction, I would need an astronomical mu_hat. However, given the game constraints and objective to minimize holding costs, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime (~13 units/week) while acknowledging that no new units will arrive until the pipeline data is effectively ignored or an order is forced. Since I cannot 'clear' the pipeline in the backend, I will set parameters to maintain a lean stock if/when the backend allows an order.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand floor remains stable at ~12-13 units/week (P35-P44 average). Total confirmed pipeline corruption is 925 units (all current In-transit balance).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late December (Period 46). Demand has stabilized at a low winter regime, averaging approximately 13 units/week over the last 10 periods (P35-P45), although a slight uptick to 26 units occurred in P45, likely due to holiday activity. On-hand inventory is zero. The in-transit inventory of 925 units is confirmed to be entirely comprised of lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, and P37 is already accounted for), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. To ensure availability for the current winter demand and the transition into early January, \u03bc\u0302 is set to 40 (based on a conservative estimate of 13 units/week for the review period + 2-period lead time, with a small buffer for the recent holiday variance). L is set to 'calculate' to use historical lead time performance, and \u03c3\u0302 is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Total pipeline corruption of 925 units is confirmed as non-recoverable (Orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24). Demand is stable at a winter floor of ~13 units/week, with minor holiday fluctuations as seen in P45 (26 units).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/30 (Year-end/New Year). The product is a jersey top, currently in its winter demand floor. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P37-P46) shows a stable mean demand of 14.5 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 925 units is entirely comprised of corrupted data from lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, P24, P30, P37 - though P37 arrived, historical totals often lag in these reports). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' to determine the order, and the backend sees 925 units in transit, it will place zero orders unless I adjust mu_hat to be extraordinarily high (which would likely be capped) or use explicit parameters to bypass the pipeline inflation. However, the system instructions specify that the backend subtracts pipeline_inventory from base_stock. Since real pipeline is 0 and on-hand is 0, but the backend thinks pipeline is 925, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered. To offset the 925-unit phantom pipeline and target a base stock of ~45 units (3 weeks of demand at ~15 units/week), I set mu_hat to 970. This ensures (970 - 925) = 45 units base stock before the OR policy cap is applied.
