Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The SKU is a 'Clarence Push Wireless Bralette'. Looking at historical demand (Jan-Feb), demand was rising through January (96, 105, 130, 150) but dropped significantly in the most recent week, 2019-02-04, to 58. This suggests a post-January slowdown or back-to-baseline shift. Given the product type and date, Valentine's Day (Feb 14) is in the current period (Period 1). I expect a small spike in demand for lingerie around this date, though the Feb 4th drop (58) implies the peak might have passed or was specific to pre-event stocking. I will use the last 5 samples to capture the mean, which averages ~108 units. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * 108. Since L=2, this covers 3 periods of demand (approx 324 units). I'll use recent_N=5 for both mu and sigma to stay responsive to recent fluctuations while acknowledging the drop to 58.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a Women's Lingerie bralette. Looking at historical demand (Jan 7 to Feb 4), we see 96, 105, 130, 150, then a sharp drop to 58 on Feb 4. Period 1 demand was 28. This suggests a post-January/post-Valentine's Day seasonal decline. The promised lead time is 2, so the Period 1 order (166 units) is expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at start of P4). Currently, on-hand is 0, lead time is 2, so we need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 = 3 periods). The mean demand over the last 3 samples (Feb 4: 58, P1: 28, plus the Jan 28 peak: 150) is highly volatile. However, focusing on the most recent regime (Feb 4 and P1), demand has dropped significantly. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this downward trend while maintaining some safety against the earlier higher volume. L is set to 'default' (2).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 3 (2019-02-25), we are managing SKU 579302001 (Women's Lingerie). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 350 units in-transit. A look at the historical demand samples (96, 105, 130, 150, 58) combined with recent game history (P1: 28, P2: 48) suggests a post-Valentine's Day drop/stabilization. Lingerie often spikes in late January/early February and then normalizes. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (166 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution phase (calculated as P1 + L=2). Therefore, it is correct that 'arrived' was 0 in P1 and P2 concludes. For parameters, I am using L=default (2). For mu_hat, the historical mean of all 7 samples is approx 88. However, the last 3 samples (58, 28, 48) average 44.6, suggesting a significant post-peak regime change. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this lower demand level (covering L+1=3 periods). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent lower volatility compared to the earlier spike periods. This ensures the backend doesn't over-order based on the high Jan/Feb spike while still maintaining a safety buffer for the current trend.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 4, 2019. The product is a women's lingerie item (bra). Historically, demand for lingerie often spikes around Valentine's Day (mid-February), followed by a reset. Looking at the demand samples: Jan 28 (150), Feb 4 (58), Feb 11 (28), Feb 18 (48), and Feb 25 (60). The post-Valentine's dip seems to have bottomed out and is slightly recovering. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the first order (Period 1) has been delayed. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The Period 1 order (placed Feb 11) should have arrived in Period 3 (Feb 25) and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read today. Since 'arrived=0', the lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect this delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the post-peak demand levels (28, 48, 60), which average 45.33 units per period. With L=3, the target horizon is 4 periods (1+3), leading to mu_hat = 181.3. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=3) to account for recent volatility.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The product is a women's lingerie item. Looking at the history, an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time of 2 periods), confirming the promised lead time. However, the order placed in Period 1 (166 units) has not yet arrived by the end of Period 4; this is concerning as it is now 2 periods overdue (calculated L should be 2, so it should have arrived in Period 3). The current in-transit inventory is 166, which refers to that missing Period 1 order. Demand has shown a significant increasing trend: 28, 48, 60, 101, up from the pre-game average of ~107. The most recent demand (101) and the trajectory suggest we are entering a higher demand phase. Given the missing shipment, I will maintain the default lead time but set mu_hat to use recent_N (N=4) to capture the accelerating demand trend while being cautious of the inventory 'hole' created by the missing Period 1 shipment. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019/3/18), we are managing SKU 579302001. Historical demand shows a significant drop in the most recent observation (58 on Feb 4, and demand in periods 4 and 5 of the game history was 101 and 75 respectively). The average demand of the last 4 observed periods (including the high Jan/Feb data) is approximately 84 units. However, current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units) due to a missed shipment from Period 1 (166 units ordered, 5 periods have passed, promised lead time was 2). This order is likely lost or significantly delayed. The Period 2 order (184 units) arrived on time in Period 4. The current in-transit (183 units) includes the 166 (Period 1) and 17 (Period 5). Since the Period 1 shipment is likely lost, the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic will be inflated, preventing new orders. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 80 * 3) and use a higher sigma to ensure a safe buffer given the shipment instability. I'm using L = explicit (2) to align with historical arrival patterns while acknowledging the missing P1 order.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 1 (166 units) is likely lost as it is 3 periods overdue; actual lead time for successful arrivals is 2 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU 579302001 (Women's Underwear/Bralette) shows a demand uptick, likely transitioning into Spring seasonal patterns. Recent demand (P4-P6) averaged 89 units, significantly higher than the initial samples. Inventory is currently 0 with 303 units in-transit. The order from Period 1 (166 units) is 5 periods past-due and is definitely lost (Carry-over insight confirms this). Excluding that lost shipment, the pipeline consists of 137 units (ordered P6) which are expected to arrive in P8 or P9. I am setting L to explicit 2 (the reliable observed lead time). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand regime (avg ~89/week) over (1+L)=3 periods, totaling approx 267. This aggressive mu_hat is necessary to replenish from 0 on-hand inventory while accounting for the lost P1 units in the backend's calculation.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1 (Period 8). We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at history: demand has stabilized between 75-101 units over the last 4 periods (mean ~91). The order from Period 1 (166 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost as per carry-over insights. Recent arrivals show lead times of 2 periods (P2 order arrived P4) and 1 period (P5 order arrived P6). In-transit inventory of 305 units likely consists of the lost P1 (166), P6 (137), and P7 (2). I will treat P1 as lost in my mental accounting. To replenish and cover demand over (L+1) periods (~273 units) while accounting for the lost shipment, I set mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (last 4 samples: 101, 75, 91, 97; mean=91). Because we are at 0 on-hand and the OR backend uses in-transit (305) which incorrectly includes the lost 166 units, I will set an explicit mu_hat to force a replenishment order that covers the pipeline gap. Target stock for L=2 is ~3 * 91 = 273. Since OR thinks we have 305/139 effective in-transit, I set L=2 and mu_hat=300 to ensure we maintain service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 91 units/period since Period 4. Period 1 order (166 units) is confirmed lost (5 periods overdue).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing a bralette SKU. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 4 (March 4th), with a mean demand of approximately 91 units (samples: 101, 75, 91, 97, 91). The holiday-related demand spike observed in January/early February has passed. Regarding supply, the Period 1 order (166 units) is now 6 periods overdue and is definitively lost. Successful arrivals demonstrate an actual lead time (L) generally of 1-2 periods (observed L: 2, 1, 2, 1). Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat captures the stable post-spike demand of ~91 per period. Given L=2 remains the promise and current observed L fluctuates between 1 and 2, I will keep L at default to maintain the safety stock calculation for 3 periods (L+1). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility in the current regime compared to the early-year samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10 (2019-04-15). The product is a wireless push-up bralette. Demand History: The initial samples (Jan-Feb) had a weekly mean of 107.8. In-game demand (Periods 1-9) shows: 28, 48, 60, 101, 75, 91, 97, 91, 68. The carry-over insight noted a stable regime around 91 units/period from Period 4-8, but Period 9 saw a dip to 68. On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 254 (composed of Period 1: 166 which is confirmed lost, Period 8: 1, and Period 9: 87). Because the Period 1 order is lost, the OR engine (which sees 254 in transit) will under-order unless we set \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) high or reduce L to force an order. However, the correct way to handle the loss while being conservative is to provide an explicit \u03bc\u0302 that covers 3 periods (L+1) of demand (~90 * 3 = 270) and trust the OR engine's cap. Lead time history shows 2, 1, 2, 1 periods. Promised is 2. I will use L=2 (default). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=6) to capture the shift from the early low demand to the stable higher demand, acknowledging the slight dip in Period 9. Sigma remains recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019/4/22). The SKU 579302001 (Women's Bralette) has shown a demand slowdown over the last two weeks (68 units in Period 9, 49 units in Period 10). Initial samples (Jan/Feb) were high (96-150), but recent performance (Feb 11 - Apr 15) shows a mean of ~65 units/period. The Period 1 order (166 units) is definitively lost. Pipeline inventory is currently 256 (In-transit 211 + Period 10 order 45). However, if we remove the 166 lost units, 'effective' pipeline is 90 units (Arriving from Period 10 order: 45, and potentially whatever else makes up the 'In-transit' 211, though the only active orders should be Period 10's 45 units if others arrived). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To stabilize, I will use a recent demand window (N=7) which covers the post-initial-spike period to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will use the promised L=2 to ensure the backend base-stock covers 3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean (~65 units/period) following the initial Jan/early-Feb peak. The 166 units from Period 1 remain lost and should be discounted from pipeline calculations.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019-04-29), the SKU '579302001' is in a lower demand regime compared to the initial peak in January/February. Analyzing the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11), the average demand is approximately 70.4 units, with a noticeable downward trend (the last three periods were 68, 49, and 47). I will use N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent lower demand level (approx 70 units/period). Lead times have varied between 1 and 2 periods (avg 1.6 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to reflect this operational volatility. The Period 1 order (166 units) is definitively lost (11 periods overdue), which the carry-over insight correctly notes. The reported In-transit of 260 units includes this lost 166 units and the active orders from Period 10 (45 units) and Period 11 (49 units). Because the OR backend uses in-transit in its base-stock calculation (= base_stock - in_transit), and it does not know the 166 units are lost, it will under-order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate for the 'phantom' 166 units in the pipeline. To override the backend's assumption that 260 units are coming, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * 70 + padding. With L=2, base stock should be ~210 + safety. However, the OR engine will subtract 260 (pipeline). I will set mu_hat to 400 to force an order that covers the current demand of ~70 units while the backend 'thinks' 166 units are still arriving.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. Demand for this wireless bralette has shown a recent spike in Period 12 (104 units), contrasting with the lower mean (~65 units) observed since Period 9. The 166 units ordered in Period 1 are officially lost (11 periods overdue), meaning the actual pipeline inventory is 266 units (432 - 166). Specifically, we are awaiting orders from P11 (49), P12 (172), and potentially a small residual. Since lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, I will set L to 2. To account for the recent demand increase while balancing it against previous lower periods, I'll use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat (covering Periods 9-12: 68, 49, 47, 104; avg ~67). Using explicit parameters for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to account for the lost P1 shipment by adjusting the perceived inventory need, as the backend's internal 'pipeline_inventory' will include the lost units. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*70 = 210 to ensure we capture the recent uptick and target a high service level given the high profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Recent demand spike observed in Period 12 (104 units) following a low-demand regime (~65 units), suggesting a potential shift as spring/summer season approaches for lingerie.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the item (Womens Lingerie) is experiencing a seasonality-driven demand shift. After a low-demand regime (~65 units/period), demand has spiked to 104 and 100 units over the last two periods. Historical arrivals show an actual lead time (L) generally between 1 and 2 periods (ignoring the lost Period 1 order). Pipeline inventory consists of 383 units: 166 (Period 1, confirmed lost), 45 (Period 10, significantly overdue, likely lost), 172 (Period 12), and 0 (Period 13). Effectively, only 172 units are expected to arrive. On-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the lost units and higher demand, I am using explicit parameters. mu_hat is set to 300 (covering L+1 periods with a forecast of ~100 units/period). sigma_hat is set at 35 to manage the recent volatility. L is set to explicit 2 to ensure the window covers the typical delay, while discounting 'lost' units in the pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Period 10 order (45 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, joining the Period 1 lost order (166 units). Effective pipeline is only 172 units (from Period 12). Demand has shifted to a higher regime (~100 units/period) for the May/Spring season.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-05-20. Demand has significantly shifted upwards to ~100 units/period (last 3 periods: 100, 104, 104) as we enter the Spring/Summer season for lingerie. Lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods; I will continue using the promised lead time of 2 for safety. Inventory Status: On-hand is 68. Total In-transit is reported as 211, but carry-over insights identify 166 units (P1) and 45 units (P10) as lost. 166 + 45 = 211. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. With L=2, the OR backend must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 300 units). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) captures the current 100-unit regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) reflects the current low volatility in this regime. This configuration will trigger an order to replenish the depleted pipeline against the higher seasonal demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher at ~100 units/period (Periods 12-14 average 102.7). All 211 units currently in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (166 from P1, 45 from P10), leaving an effective pipeline of 0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16 (2019/5/27). The product is a women's bralette. Recent demand (Periods 12-15) show readings of 104, 100, 104, and 66. The drop to 66 in Period 15 suggests the high-demand 'spring peak' (Mother's Day season) may be cooling off, but remains higher than the April lows (~45-50). I estimate the current mean demand around 90-95 units. Inventory status: On-hand is 2. In-transit is 247. Based on history, 166 (P1) and 45 (P10) are confirmed lost (5+ periods late). Additionally, the order of 36 units from P15 is in its promised lead time. This means the effective pipeline is 36, and on-hand is 2, for a total of 38. The OR backend needs to order to reach the base stock for (L+1)=3 periods. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 285 (95 * 3) to ensure enough stock is ordered to cover the current gap, accounting for the lost units being ignored by the logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Effective pipeline confirmed as 36 units (P15 order); total of 211 units (166 from P1, 45 from P10) are permanently lost and must be bypassed in replenishement calculations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17 (June 3, 2019), the demand for this bralette is showing a clear upward trend as we move into summer, with a recent jump to 139 units in Period 16. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 103 units, which aligns with the May/Spring season shift previously identified. Regarding inventory, we are currently at 0 on-hand. The 'In-transit' figure of 358 units contains 211 units from known lost orders (166 from P1, 45 from P10). Subtracting these, the actual effective pipeline consists of 147 units: 36 (P15) and 111 (P16). Since the backend OR logic subtracts the total pipeline from the target base stock, and the backend has no way to know that 211 units are lost, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high to compensate for this 'ghost' inventory. My target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (covering lead time + review period = 3 periods of demand) at ~105 units/period is roughly 315 units plus safety stock. To ensure the final order is sufficient, I set mu_hat (which the backend uses as the base stock target before safety stock and cap adjustments) to 552. This value is derived from the desired target (315) + the lost inventory (211) + a small buffer for the upward demand trend (26). This forces the backend to place an order that treats the 211 lost units as covered by the parameter increase while still replenishing to meet summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased further to ~115 units/period (avg of Periods 12-16 is 102.6, but P16 spike was 139). Total lost inventory (211 units) remains a persistent distortion in pipeline calculations.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '579302001' is entering a high-demand phase (June/Summer for lingerie), with Period 17 demand reaching 191 units\u2014its highest to date. The current demand regime (Periods 14-17) averages 125 units, significantly higher than earlier periods. As noted in the carry-over insights, there is a substantial distortion in the 'In-transit' metric: 211 units (166 from P1, 45 from P10) are permanently lost but still reflect in the backend's pipeline total. Currently, 'In-transit' is 438 units. Subtracting the 211 lost units, the effective pipeline is 227 units (which matches the Period 17 order). On-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the forecasted 125 units/period across the (L+1) window, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the seasonal surge and use sigma_hat to manage the increased volatility seen in the last period. I am sticking to L=2 as the arrived shipments (P15, P16) confirmed lead times of 2 and 1 respectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased sharply in June: Period 17 demand reached 191 units, raising the 4-period average (P14-P17) to ~125 units/period. Ongoing pipeline distortion: 211 units are confirmed lost (P1=166, P10=45) and must be manually excluded from replenishment logic.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for '579302001' (Womens Lingerie) has surged significantly in June, with 191 units in Period 17 and 129 in Period 18. This aligns with seasonal peaks for lingerie. The rolling demand average for the last 4 periods (P15-P18) is approximately 131 units/period. Pipeline management is critical: 'In-transit' currently shows 510 units, but 211 units (ordered in P1 and P10) are confirmed lost based on extensive delivery delays. Furthermore, the P17 order of 227 units and P18 order of 72 units haven't arrived yet. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to meet the new June/July demand regime, I must compensate for the 211 phantom units by inflating the mu_hat. Following the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, I set \u03bc_hat explicitly. I calculate it as (1 + Lead Time) * forecasted_demand + lost_units_compensation. With L=2, (1+2)*131 = 393. Adding 211 (lost) + ~45 (buffer for recent high demand volatility) results in 649. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the high volatility of the current June spike.

Carry-over insight: June demand surge confirmed: average demand Periods 15-18 is ~131 units/period. Lost inventory total (211 units) remains a critical distortion that requires mu_hat inflation to bypass the dead pipeline count.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand June regime (Period 19 demand: 139, Period 17: 191) for this lingerie SKU. The average demand over the last four periods (Periods 16-19) is approximately 149 units/period. The inventory management remains heavily distorted by 'ghost' pipeline units. Specifically, a total of 510 units are physically lost or permanently overdue (P1: 166 units, P10: 45 units, P12: 172 units - now 8 periods overdue, P17: 227 units - now 3 periods overdue but likely lost given high volatility and prior patterns). This leaves an effective pipeline of only 286 units (ordered Period 19). With on-hand inventory at 0 and these 510 'ghost' units preventing the OR backend from ordering, I must continue to inflate mu_hat to force a replenishment. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * (current demand mean + 510 ghost units / (1+L)). Using L=2, (1+2)*150 + 510 = 960. This ensures the base stock level targets the real demand while neutralizing the impact of the dead inventory count in the system.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total increased to 510 units (P1: 166, P10: 45, P12: 172, P17: 227). All these units are significantly past promised lead time and are confirmed lost; they must be bypassed in replenishment logic by inflating mu_hat. June demand average is confirmed at ~150 units/period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 21 (July 1st). The current situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0, and the demand regime is high (avg ~130-150 units). The primary challenge is a massive pipeline distortion. The 'In-transit' count is 1040 units, but a large portion is confirmed lost: P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172), P17 (227), and now likely P19 (286), which is 2 periods old with no arrival in Period 20 conclude. Total lost/overdue units = 896. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 144 units (from the P20 order). To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, which subtracts the full 1040 in-transit units from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to artificially inflate the target. Calculation: Average demand is ~140. For L=2, base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods, plus buffer. Required base stock ~ (140 * 3) + buffer \u2248 550. To offset the 1040 ghost units, mu_hat must be set so that (mu_hat - 1040) results in a meaningful order. Setting mu_hat to 1600 provides a target that forces the capped policy to order near the maximum allowed. I will use L=2 (promised) as actual lead times for successful deliveries continue to oscillate between 1 and 2.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory reached 896 units (P1: 166, P10: 45, P12: 172, P17: 227, P19: 286). These units are overdue and must be bypassed in replenishment logic. June/July demand regime is stabilized at ~140 units/period.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 8th, 2019. Demand remains high for this SKU (Womens Lingerie/Bralette) in the early summer regime (July), with a demand of 188 in Period 21 and a 4-period average (P18-P21) of 141 units/period. The central issue is massive shipment loss: in-transit shows 1624 units, but historically, multiple orders (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P20) are long overdue. Only 584 units (ordered P21) are currently within the promised 2-period lead time window. Based on 'Conclude' messages, actual lead time ranges from 1-2 periods for successful arrivals. To force the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline) to place an order when the pipeline is 'clogged' with lost units, I must drastically inflate mu_hat. I estimate the effective lost inventory in the 'In-transit' bucket at approximately 1040 units (1624 - 584). To clear this and secure inventory for the next 3 periods (L+1), I set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the phantom pipeline and target a base stock that ensures replenishment despite the 0 on-hand status. I am forecasting a mean demand of 150 units for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory reached 1040 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P20). These units are significantly overdue and prevent the backend from ordering unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed the phantom pipeline. Early July demand remains volatile but high, averaging ~145 units/period.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand remains high in the July summer season, with the last observed demand at 150 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 143 units/period. The main challenge remains the massive amount of 'lost' inventory in the pipeline (1308 units total in-transit). Analysis of recent arrivals confirms that shipments typically arrive with a lead time of 1 or 2 periods (e.g., P20 arrived in P22). However, many orders have failed to conclude: P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172 - though a previous log said it arrived, the current in-transit count suggests persistent ghosts), P17 (227), P19 (286), and P21 (584). Currently, only the P21 order (584 units) is still within a reasonable window for arrival. Excluding the clearly lost units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19 totaling 896 units) leaves an 'active' pipeline of 584 units plus current on-hand of 166. To force the OR backend to place a replenishment order despite the 1308 phantom units in-transit, I must set mu_hat (which covers L+1 periods) to a value exceeding (In-Transit + On-hand). With L=2, mu_hat represents demand for 3 periods. To overcome the 1474 total units visible to the backend and target a base stock sufficient for continued high demand (~150/week), I set mu_hat explicitly to 1600. This ensures the backend perceives the need for more stock to cover the summer peak.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory reached 1308 units (including significant recent losses from P17, P19, and likely P21 if it doesn't arrive by P24). The backend requires extreme mu_hat inflation (>1474) to trigger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1290.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe on-hand inventory of 648 units after the arrival of 584 units from the Period 21 order. Current 'In-transit' is 935 units. However, previous analysis confirms that a significant portion of this pipeline consists of lost shipments: 166 units (P1), 45 units (P10), 172 units (P12), 227 units (P17), 286 units (P19). Total confirmed lost = 896 units. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore (935 - 896) = 39 units (specifically the P23 order of 211 units minus the phantom counts). Demand remains relatively high but showed a slight dip to 102 units in the most recent period. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is (139+108+188+150+102)/5 = 137.4 units. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 896 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to exceed (on-hand + total in-transit). Requirement: mu_hat > (648 + 935) = 1583. Using an explicit mu_hat of 1750 to ensure replenishment triggers, covering roughly 3 periods of high-season demand plus the bypass factor.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Total confirmed lost inventory remains at 896 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19). These units distort the pipeline and require mu_hat inflation > 1583 to trigger orders. Demand regime is stable at ~135 units/period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized around an average of 135 units/period for the late-July summer season (Periods 21-24 average ~139). Period 24 demand was 117. The current on-hand inventory is 531 units. The In-transit pipeline of 1202 units contains 896 units identified as permanently lost (P1: 166, P10: 45, P12: 172, P17: 227, P19: 286), resulting in an effective pipeline of 306 units (P23: 211, P24: 267 minus recent arrivals). However, the OR backend sees the full In-transit amount (1202) + On-hand (531) = 1733 units. To ensure the backend triggers an order if needed, or at least recognizes real demand, mu_hat must be set to account for this 896-unit phantom inventory. Setting mu_hat to 135 * (1 + 2) = 405 (the actual expected demand over review + lead time) would result in zero orders because the phantom pipeline (1733) exceeds this. I will set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the phantom inventory (+896) and cover the desired service level. Total target inventory should be around 1300 units to offset the 896 dead units while maintaining enough safety stock for ~135 units/period demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-08-05. Demand has cooled slightly from the June/July peak (avg ~145) to an average of ~94 over the last 3 periods (P23-P25: 102, 117, 71). On-hand inventory is healthy at 460 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1202 units is highly distorted by historical losses. Based on the history, confirmed losses include P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172), P17 (227), and P19 (286), totaling 896 units. Additionally, the P23 order (211) is now at its promised lead time (2 periods); if it doesn't arrive in Period 26, it may also be lost. The effective pipeline (legitimate orders likely to arrive) is roughly 1202 - 896 = 306 units (consisting of P23: 211 and P24: 267 minus variations). To ensure the OR backend orders if needed, mu_hat must be set to account for both the expected lead-time demand and the 896 units of phantom inventory. With L=2 and target service level q=0.95 (Profit 19, Holding 1), base stock should be ~1300-1400. I will set L=recent_N (N=5) to capture actual performance, mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1350 to bypass the phantom stock, and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 26, the 896 units from orders P1, P10, P12, P17, and P19 are confirmed lost. The demand regime has transitioned from a summer peak (~145) to a late-summer average of ~95 units/period.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27 (2019/8/12), the SKU is in a post-summer transition phase. Looking at the arrival history, the Period 23 order (211 units) arrived in Period 26, confirming a lead time of 3 periods, although most successful shipments arrive in 2. The 'In-transit' quantity of 991 units is heavily distorted by 896 units identified as permanently lost (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19). The 267 units ordered in P24 are effectively the only real pipeline. Current on-hand is 557 units, which is high. Demand has cooled from the June/July peak (~145 units) to a late-summer average of ~95 units (P25: 71, P26: 114). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this cooling trend (avg ~100) while keeping sigma_hat default to account for volatility. With high on-hand and a real pipeline of 267, I will use default mu_hat and L parameters to let the backend naturally wind down the high inventory level without triggering new orders that would overstock during a declining demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for successful deliveries remains 2-3 periods; however, the persistent 896 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19) in the pipeline must be considered lost and ignored when observing the system's order behavior.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the current on-hand inventory is 361 units. The demand surge in Period 27 (196 units) suggests late-summer volatility or a promotion, though the general trend from Period 25-27 averages 127 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 991 units is heavily distorted by historical losses: P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172), P17 (227), and P19 (286), totalling 896 confirmed lost units. The only valid pipeline order is from Period 24 (267 units), which is now 4 periods old and potentially delayed or lost. Currently, on-hand (361) covers approximately 3 periods of demand at the recent average. To prevent the OR backend from remaining idle due to the 896 phantom units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to exceed the phantom pipeline plus the desired base stock. I will use an explicit mu_hat targeting a base stock of approximately 1400 units to bypass the 896 lost units and target a real saftey stock of ~500 (representing roughly 4 periods of demand cover at ~125/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total 896 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19) are confirmed permanently lost. Period 24 order (267 units) is 2 periods overdue and potentially lost as well. Demand remains volatile but averages ~125 units over the last 4 periods.

This may indicate a late summer/pre-fall boost. Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' figure of 1171 is heavily distorted by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost orders include: P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172), P17 (227), and P19 (286), totaling 896 units. Additionally, the P24 order (267 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, as recent successful lead times (P21, P23) were 2-3 periods. This brings suspected lost inventory to 1163 units. With current on-hand at 193 and an effective pipeline near 0, I must ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order. To bypass the ~1163 units recognized as 'In-transit' by the system, mu_hat must be set above the sum of the phantom pipeline and the desired base stock. To cover (L+1=3) periods of demand at a forecast of ~135/period (~405 units) plus the 1163 units of dead weight, mu_hat must be at least 1568. I will set mu_hat to 1600 to ensure the order is placed.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total confirmed and suspected lost inventory now includes P24 (267 units), bringing the total phantom pipeline to 1163 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24). Demand has spiked again in late August (avg 182 over last 2 weeks).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30 (2019/09/02), the inventory situation is heavily distorted by a 'phantom pipeline'. The reported In-transit inventory is 1547 units, but based on historical analysis and time elapsed, approximately 1163 units (P1: 166, P10: 45, P12: 172, P17: 227, P19: 286, P24: 267) are confirmed or highly likely to be permanently lost. The actual functional pipeline consists of orders from P28 (180 units) and P29 (376 units), totaling 556 units. Current on-hand inventory is 82 units. Demand has been high, averaging ~158 units/period over the last 4 periods (P26-P29). To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order despite the phantom 1163 units, mu_hat must be set to exceed the sum of (on-hand + total pipeline). The required threshold is 82 + 1547 = 1629 units. Setting mu_hat to 1800 provides a safety margin for the high late-summer demand and bypasses the dead pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for high demand volatility observed during spikes.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 30, the total confirmed lost inventory (phantom pipeline) has reached 1163 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24). The OR backend must be overridden with inflated mu_hat values (>1629) to account for these missing units and maintain stock levels.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/09. Demand shows a late-summer/fall regime shift. The most recent demand (P30) was 89, following counts of 111, 168, and 196. The last 4 periods average ~141. The phantom pipeline (confirmed/suspected lost orders) remains a critical issue. The 'In-transit' count is 1950. However, the phantom units are: P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172), P17 (227), P19 (286), P20 (316 - wait, P20 arrived), let's re-calculate. Lost units: P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172), P17 (227), P19 (286), P21 (584 - wait, P21 arrived). Checking history carefully: P20 arrived P22, P21 arrived P23, P23 arrived P26, P28 arrived P30. Lost: P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172), P17 (227), P19 (286), P24 (267). Total lost = 1163 units. Current 'In-transit' is 1950. Real 'In-transit' = 1950 - 1163 = 787 (Orders from P29 and P30). To ensure the OR backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) triggers an order when On-hand(173) + Real In-transit(787) = 960 is below target, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover the phantom 1163. Target should be ~150/period * 3 periods = 450 + safety. I will set mu_hat to 2200 to override the 1163 phantom units and ensure we replenish based on the actual 140-150 demand and current 173 on-hand.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31, the total phantom pipeline (confirmed lost) is 1163 units (P1: 166, P10: 45, P12: 172, P17: 227, P19: 286, P24: 267). Demand has moderated slightly from late August peaks but remains robust around 100-140 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/16. Demand in recent periods (P29-P31: 111, 89, 72) indicates a transition away from the late August peak into a lower autumn regime. The average demand over the last 3 periods is ~91 units. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 2154 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Confirmed lost orders include P1 (166), P10 (45), P12 (172), P17 (227), P19 (286), and P24 (267), totaling 1163 units. Furthermore, P27 (0), P28 (180 - arrived), P29 (376), P30 (583), and P31 (204) are the only potentially active orders. Subtracting the 1163 'phantom' units from the 2154 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 991 units, which is still very high compared to a demand of ~91. However, since the OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' number (2154) to calculate the order (Base Stock - Pipeline), I must set mu_hat high enough to offset both the phantom units and provide stock for the next 3 periods (L+1). To ensure a replenishment order is triggered if needed, mu_hat must technically exceed 2053 (Pipeline 2154 - On-hand 101). Given the current on-hand of 101 and a lower demand regime, I will use an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand (~300 units) plus the 1163 lost units to bypass the backend's logic, totaling 1463.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 32, the phantom pipeline (confirmed lost) remains at 1163 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24). Demand has shifted to a lower autumn regime averaging ~90 units/period (Periods 30-31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, we have an on-hand inventory of 826 units. The 'In-transit' count is 1367, but this is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments totaling 1163 units (P1: 166, P10: 45, P12: 172, P17: 227, P19: 286, P24: 267). Subtracting these from the 1367 units in transit reveals an actual effective pipeline of 204 units from Period 31 (which actually arrived in Period 32, meaning effective pipeline is now 0). Recent demand has entered a lower autumn regime, with the last 3 periods averaging 74 units (89, 72, 62). To prevent the OR backend from remaining idle due to the massive phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the phantom inventory plus a safety buffer for current demand. The target base stock should be (L+1) * current_demand_rate. With L=2 and demand ~75, we need ~225 units. Since we have 826 on hand, we are currently overstocked and do not need to order. However, to ensure the backend logic functions, I set mu_hat such that the base stock (calculated by the backend) reflects the reality of the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom pipeline of 1163 units persists; demand regime has stabilized at a lower autumn mean of ~75 units over the last 3 periods (P30-P32).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (September 30), the current on-hand inventory is 731 units. The demand regime has transitioned from the summer peak to a lower autumn average of roughly 75-80 units per period (average of P30-P33 is ~80). The total in-transit units are 1367. Based on history, 1163 units are confirmed 'phantom' or lost (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24). Subtracting these lost units from the 1367 in-transit leaves an 'effective pipeline' of 204 units (from P29). These 204 units are now 5 periods overdue given the order date of P29 and the current P34 start, making them highly suspicious. However, with 731 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~80, the current stock covers approximately 9+ periods. Therefore, there is no immediate need to trigger a new order by inflating mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current autumn demand regime (~80 units/period) and wait for the stock to deplete further while monitoring if any of the older in-transit units finally arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: The 204 units ordered in Period 29 are now 5 periods overdue and potentially lost, joining the existing 1163 phantom units (total 1367 potentially lost). Effective inventory remains roughly 731 units on-hand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 7, 2019. Demand for this wireless lace bralette has stabilized into an autumn regime, averaging approximately 74 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34: 89, 72, 62, 95, 66). On-hand inventory is healthy at 665 units, which provides roughly 9 periods of cover at current demand rates. There is a significant 'phantom pipeline' of 1,367 units (orders from P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, and now P29) that are confirmed or likely lost. Specifically, the P29 order (376 units) is now 5 periods overdue and is added to the phantom total. Given the high on-hand stock and the moderate demand, no new orders are required. The OR backend naturally won't order because on-hand (665) + phantom in-transit (1,367) far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 75-unit/period demand. We set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the contemporary autumn demand profile while maintaining a default lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: The 376 units ordered in Period 29 are now 5 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing the total phantom pipeline (confirmed lost) to 1,743 units. Demand remains stable at ~75 units/period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14th, 2019. Demand for the past 4 periods (P32-P35) has averaged 69.5 units/period (62, 95, 66, 55), confirming a lower autumn regime compared to the summer peak. On-hand inventory is 610 units. The 'In-transit' count of 1367 units is composed entirely of phantom inventory from lost orders (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29). Since these 1367 units will never arrive but are counted by the OR backend as pipeline inventory, the backend will not place new orders unless mu_hat is significantly inflated. Current on-hand (610) is sufficient to cover approximately 8 weeks of current demand (~75 units/period), and with the game nearing its end (Period 36 of 47), there is little risk of stockout but a high risk of holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the recent 4-period mean (~70) to reflect the current regime, but I will NOT yet inflate mu_hat to overcome the phantom pipeline because the current on-hand inventory is already high (610 units) and we want to avoid further accumulation of holding costs. I will monitor for the point where on-hand drops below the safety level before forcing a new order through inflation.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total phantom pipeline confirmed at 1367 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29). Current demand regime is stable at ~70 units/period (Periods 32-35).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the Clarence Push Wireless Bralette has entered a significantly lower autumn regime, with the last 5 periods (P32-P36) averaging ~63 units/period, down from the summer peak. We are currently in late October. On-hand inventory is 573 units, which is ample given the current demand trend (covering ~9 periods). The 'In-transit' figure of 1367 units is comprised of orders from Period 1 (166), Period 10 (45), Period 12 (172), Period 17 (227), Period 19 (286), Period 24 (267), and Period 29 (376 - 204 units arrived in P32, but the P29 order was 376 total, meaning 172 might still be missing or the 204 was part of a different split). Regardless, these units are all significantly overdue (L=2 promised) and are confirmed lost. Because the on-hand inventory (573) is much higher than the current base stock requirement for a demand of ~63 (approx 200-250 units), no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent slowdown and avoid unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: The order from Period 29 (originally 376 units) is now 8 periods overdue for any remaining balance, confirming the total phantom pipeline remains at 1367 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29). Demand regime has settled into a late-autumn low of ~60-70 units/period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, late autumn. Demand has clearly shifted to a lower regime, with the last four periods averaging 49.25 units (P34-P37: 66, 55, 37, 39). This is a significant drop from the summer peaks and the initial autumn stabilization. The phantom pipeline (confirmed lost inventory) remains at 1367 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29). On-hand inventory is 534 units, which at the current demand rate covers approximately 10-11 weeks of sales. Since the target base stock (calculated as (L+1) * mu) should be much lower than the combination of on-hand (534) and phantom pipeline (1367), no order will be triggered unless mu_hat is inflated above ~1901. However, since the current on-hand inventory is already high relative to the low autumn demand, there is no immediate risk of stockout. Therefore, I will set parameters to reflect the actual low-demand regime. This correctly prevents new orders while we bleed off the excess on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting P34: late autumn average dropped to ~50 units/period (from ~75 in early autumn).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (push-up bralette) has entered a stable late-autumn/winter low regime. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), demand has averaged 46 units/period (66, 55, 37, 39, 33). Currently, we have 501 units on-hand, which covers over 10 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1367 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 1, 10, 12, 17, 19, 24, and 29, which are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time and are confirmed lost. Because the current on-hand inventory (501) is far higher than the required base stock for a 50 units/period regime (approx 150-200 units including safety stock), no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent demand drop while maintaining L at default to monitor for any future replenishment needs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, 2019. Demand for this wireless bralette has significantly declined as we enter late autumn, stabilizing at a much lower regime of ~33-40 units per period over the last 4 periods (P36-P39). The on-hand inventory is 468 units, which is ample to cover several months of demand at current rates (approx 12-14 weeks of supply). There is a persistent 'phantom pipeline' of 1367 units from verified lost orders (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29). Since current on-hand inventory is already high relative to the new, lower demand mean, and the phantom pipeline would prevent the backend from ordering regardless, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method (N=6, covering the shift from ~60 to ~35 units) to align the backend's internal stock targets with the lower seasonal demand. No orders are required this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 36: Late autumn demand stabilized at ~35 units/period (average of P36-P39 is 35.5), down from the previous early autumn mean of ~70.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 579302001 (bralette) has stabilized at a late-autumn low. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is ~34 units/period, showing a clear seasonal decline from the summer peak. The system currently holds 440 units on-hand. There is a persistent 'In-transit' figure of 1367 units, which consists of orders from Periods 1, 10, 12, 17, 19, 24, and 29. These units are far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods and are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing these phantom units as available pipeline and potentially blocking future orders (if demand rises), I will continue to monitor the gap. However, with 440 units on-hand and a current demand mean of ~34, we have approximately 13 weeks of stock. No new orders should be triggered. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 5-period regime (N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-demand environment, which ensures the base stock remains lower than the on-hand inventory, effectively pausing replenishment until seasonal demand returns or stock depletes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 25, 2019, approaching the holiday season. Historical demand for this bralette (579302001) has settled into a late-autumn low, with the last 6 periods averaging ~33 units/period (P36-P41: 37, 39, 33, 33, 28, 29). Despite a potential December holiday lift, on-hand inventory is currently very high at 411 units, which is over 12 weeks of cover at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1367 units consists entirely of orders from P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, and P29 that are long overdue and confirmed lost. Because the current on-hand inventory (411) significantly exceeds the desired base stock for the current demand regime (approx 3 * 33 = 99 units), no new orders should be placed. To prevent the OR backend from factoring in the 1367 phantom units and potentially further suppressing future orders if demand spikes, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime. No inflation is needed to trigger orders currently because on-hand alone is excessive.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 43 (early December). The recent demand has shown a slight uptick in Period 42 (68 units) compared to the late-autumn average of ~30-35 units, which is consistent with the lead-up to the holiday season and Black Friday/Cyber Monday periods. However, the system still holds 343 units on-hand. Crucially, the 'In-transit' quantity of 1367 units consists entirely of orders confirmed lost (Periods 1, 10, 12, 17, 19, 24, and 29). These phantom units prevent the OR backend from placing new orders unless mu_hat is inflated beyond the phantom pipeline plus safety stock. Given the current on-hand inventory (343 units) and the stabilization of demand at a lower mean (~35-40 units/period, even with the recent spike), our stock is sufficient to cover approximately 8-10 weeks of demand. Therefore, no replenishment is needed this period. I will continue to use 'explicit' mu_hat to prevent the 'In-transit' calculation from triggering unnecessary orders while we bleed off the existing excess inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the December pre-holiday period (2019/12/9). Looking at recent demand history, there is a clear upward shift: Period 42 demand was 68 and Period 43 was 98. This indicates the start of the holiday shopping season for lingerie (likely driven by gift-giving and festive attire). The average demand over the last two weeks is 83 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 35 units. I expect this higher demand to persist or increase through late December. On-hand inventory is currently 245 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,367 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29) and must be bypassed. To ensure the backend triggers an order despite the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1,700. This value exceeds the 1,367 lost units plus the safety stock needed for the forecasted 83+ units/week demand over the lead time (L+1=3). This ensures we maintain a healthy physical inventory as we head into the peak holiday week.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike confirmed: Demand increased from ~35 to ~83 (+137%) starting Period 42 (late Nov/early Dec). Total phantom pipeline remains 1367 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 16, 2019, which is the peak of the holiday shopping season for lingerie. Period 44 saw a massive demand spike to 232 units, confirming the anticipated holiday surge. On-hand inventory has plummeted to 13 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1544 units is significantly comprised of the long-standing 'phantom pipeline' (1367 units from P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29 that are confirmed lost). The only valid in-transit order is the 177 units from Period 44. To trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the total pipeline of 1544 units. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat at 1800 units (accounting for 3 periods of holiday demand at ~150-200/period plus the 1544 unit pipeline offset) to ensure we maintain stock for the final holiday push and post-holiday sales.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked in Period 44 at 232 units. The phantom pipeline (lost orders) remains 1367 units, necessitating mu_hat inflation above 1544 to maintain active replenishment.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 (Dec 23), the pre-Christmas/Holiday peak. Demand in Period 44 was 232 and Period 45 was 176, confirming a high-demand regime compared to the autumn low of ~35. The phantom pipeline (confirmed lost units) is 1,367 units (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29). With 0 on-hand and an 'In-transit' of 2,027 units, the effective pipeline is only 660 units (2027 - 1367). The backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will not order unless mu_hat is significantly inflated to exceed the phantom units. To trigger a replenishment that covers the upcoming holiday/post-holiday demand, mu_hat must be set above 1,367 + (anticipated demand). The holiday average (P42-P45) is ~143.5. We set mu_hat explicitly to 1,850 to bypass the 1,367 phantom units and target an effective base stock of ~483 units, which aligns with recent peak demand levels (approx 3 periods of 160 units). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual 1-2 period delivery performance seen in successful orders.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand peaked significantly (P44: 232, P45: 176); effective pipeline is monitored at 660 units after subtracting 1,367 phantom units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is Dec 30, right after the Christmas/Holiday peak for lingerie (P44-P45). Demand remained strong in P46 (151 units), though it is starting to taper down from the holiday high. My current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit is 2085 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 1367 of these units are permanently lost (P1, P10, P12, P17, P19, P24, P29). This leaves an effective pipeline of 718 units (P44: 177, P45: 483, P46: 58). With lead times historically being 1-2 periods, the P44 order (177 units) should arrive in P47, and the P45 order (483 units) in P48. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 1367 lost units as available stock and stopping all orders, I must use 'mu_hat' inflation. I estimate the post-holiday January demand to return to roughly 100-120 units per period. To clear the 1367 phantom units, mu_hat needs to exceed (Lost_Units + (L+1)*Target_Demand) / (1), where L=2. Setting mu_hat to 1750 (approx 1367 + 3*125) ensures the backend maintains a healthy stock level despite the phantom data.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand (late Dec) remains elevated at ~150 units but is expected to cycle down in January. Total phantom pipeline (confirmed lost) remains fixed at 1367 units.
