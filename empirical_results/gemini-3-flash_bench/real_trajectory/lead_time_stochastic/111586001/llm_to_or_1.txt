Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 111586001 (Women's Tights). Inventory is currently 0, and we need to establish initial stock. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 68, 109, 126, 114, 116. The mean of these samples is 106.6 and the standard deviation is approx 22.4. Promised lead time (L) is 2. The standard base stock calculation for (L+1) coverage requires looking at 3 periods of demand. Using the 'default' method for mu_hat will use the mean of all available historical samples (106.6) multiplied by (1+L). Given the product type and February date, there are no immediate massive seasonal spikes expected, but we need to cover the initial zero-inventory position immediately. I will use 'default' for all parameters to establish the baseline until observed lead times or demand shifts are recorded.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Shape Up 30 den 1p Tights', which typically sees steady demand early in the year. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 147 units, which is higher than any of the 5 historical samples provided (range: 68-126). This suggests a possible upward shift or high volatility. With 0 on-hand inventory and 144 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1), we are currently stock-out. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent higher demand while including historical context. For lead time, I will stick with the promised 2 periods (default) until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for these tights has been increasing: 68, 109, 126, 114, 116 (pre-game samples) to 147 and 178 (Periods 1 and 2). This suggests a positive trend, likely aligning with seasonal transitions in late February. The promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (144 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (concluded in Period 4) and the Period 2 order (148 units) is expected in Period 4. Total In-transit is 292. Currently, On-hand is 0, leading to lost sales. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend (avg ~136.2) and scaling it for (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, recent_N=5 captures the increased volatility. L is set to 'default' (2) as we haven't yet confirmed any actual lead time deviations from the 'Period conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Womens Tights) is currently experiencing stockouts as all demand through Period 3 (147, 178, 141) has been lost with 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (144 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase, making them visible in the Period 4 start. However, the 'In-transit' total is 409 units (144 + 148 + 117), and the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the order from P1 (ordered at P1 start) did NOT arrive by the end of P3. Therefore, the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed. Given the historical demand samples (68, 109, 126, 114, 116) and recent active demand (147, 178, 141), mean demand has shifted upwards significantly. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to capture the higher recent demand regime. This will increase the base stock calculation to ensure higher availability once shipments start arriving.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 1: Average weekly demand increased from ~100 to ~155 (+55%). Potential lead time deviation: Period 1 order (L=2) did not arrive by end of Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019-03-11), we see the first shipment arrival. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). However, the Period 1 order (144 units) is significantly overdue and appears to be a lost shipment, as the system reported the Period 2 arrival instead. Current on-hand is low (19), and demand remains consistently high compared to the pre-game samples. Since Feb 11, demand has averaged 148.75 units per week (147, 178, 141, 129), compared to the initial ~100. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this new regime. Because the Period 1 shipment is likely lost, the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard (449) is inflated by those 144 lost units. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (2+1) * 150 = 450, which targets a base stock that ignores the lost pipeline and ensures the OR engine places a replenishing order immediately to bridge the gap and maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 shipment (144 units) most likely lost; Period 2 arrived on time confirming L=2 still holds. Demand regime stabilized around 150 units/week (+50% from baseline).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (2019/3/18), the system is out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 449 units in-transit. Historic demand (samples + game history) shows a shift: samples averaged ~106, while the last 5 periods (P1-P5) averaged 140.4. Specifically, the last two weeks (P4 and P5) showed a cooling trend (129, 107) compared to the initial post-baseline surge (147, 178, 141). The P1 shipment is confirmed lost (promised L=2, now P6 start). P2 arrived on time (L=2). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the reliable P2 arrival while accounting for the missing P1 shipment in the pipeline. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 (covering the game history P1-P5) to capture the higher post-baseline demand average (~140) while acknowledging the recent slight decline. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this regime.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The SKU 111586001 (Shape Up Tights) shows a consistent demand regime since Period 1, averaging ~140 units/week (samples: 147, 178, 141, 129, 107, 139). This is significantly higher than the pre-game samples (mean ~106). Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory (449) consists of orders from Period 3 (117), Period 4 (188), and Period 1's lost 144 units. Note: Period 1's order is clearly lost as lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4), and we are now at Period 7. The Period 3 order was expected in Period 5 but hasn't arrived; the Period 4 order was expected in Period 6 but hasn't arrived. This suggests a potential lead time drift or additional lost shipments. Given the on-hand stockout and the pipeline uncertainty, I will set L to 'calculate' to incorporate observed lead times, and use mu_hat with recent_N=6 to capture the current demand regime (~140/week). I will use a high volatility estimate (sigma_hat) to account for the supply chain instability.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption: Period 1 shipment (144) is confirmed lost. Period 3 (117) and Period 4 (188) orders are overdue (expected L=2, now P7), indicating either lead time drift or further lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 (2019/4/1). A critical supply chain disruption is evident. The Period 1 order (144 units) is confirmed lost. More alarmingly, orders from Period 3 (due P5) and Period 4 (due P6) have not arrived as of the end of Period 7. This indicates either a significant lead-time extension or systemic shipment failures. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 449 units 'in-transit' (representing orders from P1, P3, and P4). Since P1 is lost, effective in-transit is likely ~305. I will set the lead time to an explicit '4' to force the base stock calculation to cover a longer protection interval (L+1=5), accounting for the observed delays. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the pre-game samples. Since P1 (start of game), demand has averaged ~144 units/period (147, 178, 141, 129, 107, 139, 166). I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (~144 mean) effectively while the OR backend applies the 5-period multiplier for base stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Lead time appears to have shifted from 2 to at least 4 periods (P3 and P4 orders are >2 periods overdue). P1 shipment is lost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. The supply chain for SKU 111586001 is severely disrupted. The Period 1 shipment is confirmed lost. Shipments from Period 3 (117 units) and Period 4 (188 units) are significantly overdue. Specifically, the P3 order should have arrived in P5 (L=2) or P6 (L=3), but remains in-transit at P9, suggesting either massive lead-time drift or further losses. However, the last recorded arrival (P2 order) arrived in 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a higher-volume regime (avg ~140-150 units/week) compared to the initial baseline. The 'In-transit' quantity (632) likely includes the lost Period 1 shipment (144) and the heavily delayed P3/P4 batches. To compensate for the lead-time uncertainty and the stockouts, I am setting L to 4 (explicitly acknowledging the drift) and using the recent 8 samples to capture the increased demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand (mu_hat) and increased risk (sigma_hat) during this period of instability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time disruption confirmed: Period 3 and 4 orders are now 4+ periods overdue, suggesting L is at least 4 for current planning purposes despite the official L=2 promise.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), we face a severe supply chain crisis. The Period 1 order (144 units) is confirmed lost. More critically, the Period 3 (ordered 2019/2/25) and Period 4 (ordered 2019/3/04) shipments are now 6 and 5 periods overdue respectively, despite a promised lead time of 2. This confirms a significant drift in actual lead time or systemic shipment failures. While the 'In-transit' quantity is high (700 units), the pipeline is dry at the destination (On-hand: 0). Recent demand (Periods 4-9) fluctuates around a mean of 130.6. I am setting L to 5 (explicitly) to reflect the observed delay, forcing the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers a much longer horizon. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand regime (~130 units), and sigma_hat is also updated to reflect recent volatility. The goal is to aggressively trigger orders to refill the pipeline, as current 'In-transit' stock is likely stuck or lost.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: Actual lead time has drifted to at least 5-6 periods (P3 and P4 orders are >4 periods past due). Total in-transit of 700 units includes potentially multiple lost shipments (P1, P3, P4).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we finally saw a resumption of supply with arrivals from Period 8 (LT=2) and Period 9 (LT=1). This confirms that shipments from Period 1, 3, and 4 (totaling 449 units) are effectively lost, as they did not arrive even when more recent orders did. The current on-hand inventory is 151 units. The demand has stabilized in a regime averaging approximately 135 units/week since Period 1 (N=10). Although recent deliveries showed short lead times (1 and 2), the history of losses suggests we should treat the lead time as 2 for planning safety. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean_demand = (1+2)*135 = 405. sigma_hat is based on the standard deviation of recent demand (~24) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is approximately 42. By using these parameters, the OR backend will calculate a base stock around 405 to cover current and future demand while the pipeline is cleared of the 'phantom' lost stock tracking.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery: Period 8 and 9 orders arrived in Period 10, confirming that orders from P1, P3, and P4 (449 units) are permanently lost shipments. Actual lead time has reverted to 1-2 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Supply chain recovery confirmed. Period 8 arrived with lead time 2, and Period 9 arrived with lead time 1. Period 1, 3, and 4 orders (449 units total) are definitively lost. The reported 'In-transit' of 533 units likely contains these 449 lost units plus the Period 10 order (84 units). Since the OR backend uses pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) to determine the order size, and 'In-transit' is inflated by ghost units that will never arrive, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or adjust L. However, the most robust way to handle lost stock in this specific OR framework is to use an 'explicit' L to account for the risk and an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for the fact that ~450 units of the pipeline are non-existent. Demand has stabilized around 110-120 units recently, but I need to cover the current inventory deficit. Average demand over the last 5 periods is approx 110. I will set L to 2 (promised). I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide enough target stock to overcome the 449 lost units in the pipeline. Calculation: Target = (L+1)*Demand + Buffer + Lost Units. (3 * 115) + (1 * 50) + 449 \u2248 844.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory correction: 449 units (from P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost and remain as 'ghost' stock in pipeline inventory. Future ordering must compensate for this ~450 unit deficit until the pipeline is cleared or adjusted.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU 111586001 has 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit 'pipeline' of 796 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 449 units from orders placed in Periods 1 (144), 3 (117), and 4 (188) are confirmed lost. These units act as 'ghost' inventory in the OR engine's pipeline calculation (796 - 449 = 347 true pipeline units). Additionally, demand has stabilized from an initial mean of ~100 to a new regime of ~125 since Period 1. The recent lead times in Period 10 (2 periods and 1 period) suggest that lead time has stabilized back toward the promised L=2. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 449 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window using the current mean (~125) plus a safety buffer, then add the 449 lost units to that target. Base stock = (125 * 3) + 449 = 824. This forces the engine to order units even though the system thinks the pipeline is full. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Pipeline adjustment remains necessary. True pipeline is 347 units; 449 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost 'ghost' stock. Weekly demand regime since P1 averages 125 units (std ~25).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: On-hand is 0, demand remains stable around 125 units/week. Significant supply chain issues: 449 units (from P1, P3, P4 orders) are confirmed lost/ghost inventory. The current 'In-transit' of 824 includes these 449 ghost units, meaning the actual pipeline is 375 units (P10: 84, P12: 263, P13: 28). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient quantities, I must account for these 449 lost units. The OR engine uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. If I set mu_hat to cover actual demand plus the gap created by ghost inventory, the backend will order correctly. Forecasted demand for (L+1=3) periods is 375. I add the 449 ghost units to the demand forecast to force the backend to 'fill' the hole. Calculated mu_hat = 375 + 449 = 824. Promised lead time L=2 is performing reliably again for recent shipments (P8 and P9), so I stick with L=2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' pipeline: 449 units (P1: 144, P3: 117, P4: 188) are lost but remain in pipeline count. mu_hat must be adjusted upward by this amount to trigger replacement orders.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Tights) has an inventory accounting issue due to confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4, totaling 449 units (144 + 117 + 188). These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure (current: 561), meaning the functional pipeline is only 112 units (representing orders from P10 and P13). To force the OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline) to place a necessary replacement order, I must temporarily inflate mu_hat by the amount of the lost stock. The current demand regime is stable, averaging ~120 units over the last 5 weeks (P10-P14). For P15, with L=2, the required coverage is 3 periods (L+1). Calculation: (3 * 120) + 449 = 809. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure this replacement logic is triggered. Lead time (L) is back to the promised 2 periods. Sigma is set to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction in progress: 449 'ghost' units from P1, P3, P4 are still tracked in in-transit. mu_hat is being explicitly inflated to force replacement orders until the pipeline clears.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (L=2). However, a significant accounting issue persists: 449 units from orders placed in Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline count (the 'ghost' inventory). Current on-hand is 122 and reported in-transit is 629. Subtracting the ghost inventory (629 - 449) reveals an actual pipeline of only 180 units (orders from P13 and P15). Demand since Period 10 has softened slightly, averaging ~97 units per week. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand PLUS the 449 units of ghost inventory. Target base stock = (3 * 100) + 449 = 749. Setting mu_hat to 749 via the 'explicit' method will force the backend to reconcile the gap between the perceived pipeline (629 + 122 = 751) and the target, effectively triggering replacement orders as the current stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Ghost inventory of 449 units remains in 'In-transit'. mu_hat must be explicitly set to (Target Base Stock + 449) until these units are purged from the system to prevent stockouts.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 449 units of 'ghost inventory' from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (144 + 117 + 188) that are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure (629 units). The actual functional pipeline is only 180 units (from P13 and P15). Demand has softened recently (avg ~62 over 4 weeks), but remains higher on a 10-week horizon (~104). To compensate for the 449-unit ghost inventory and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Calculations: Actual Target Base Stock (TBS) = (L+1) * mu + z*sigma. Using L=2, mu=100 (conservative average), and sigma=30, the TBS is approx 360 units. I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - ghost_inventory' results in the desired TBS. Therefore, mu_hat = 360 + 449 = 809. As long as the ghost units are reported in in-transit, this explicit override is necessary to ensure the backend actually places orders when on-hand inventory depletes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-91.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Shape Up Tights) is currently in a lower demand phase compared to earlier in the year, with recent weekly demand averaging approximately 51 units (last 4 periods: 83, 58, 25, 37). Lead times have stabilized at the promised 2 periods (Period 15 order arrived in Period 17). However, the systemic issue of 'ghost' inventory persists. Specifically, 449 units from orders in Periods 1 (144), 3 (117), and 4 (188) are confirmed lost but remains in the 'In-transit' count of 644. Subtracting these ghost units reveals a true pipeline of 195 units (644 - 449). Current on-hand is 128 units. Total usable inventory is 128 (OH) + 195 (True Pipeline) = 323 units. With the OR backend using the capped policy 'final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)', the 'ghost' inventory artificially suppresses new orders because the backend thinks we have 449 units more than we actually do. To force the backend to place replacement orders, I must set 'mu_hat' to (Target Base Stock + 449). Using a 4-week recent demand average (50.75 units) and L=2, a standard base stock would be ~152 units (3 periods of coverage). Adding the 449 ghost units yields a mu_hat of 152 + 449 = 601. I will set sigma_hat to 65 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Continued ghost inventory correction: 449 units from P1, P3, and P4 remain in the systemic in-transit count despite being lost. mu_hat is being explicitly inflated by +449 to bypass the OR engine's pipeline check until these units are purged.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 644 units in-transit. However, based on the historical pattern (confirmed in Period 11 and ongoing carry-over insights), 449 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are permanently lost 'ghost' units. The true pipeline is 195 units (644 - 449). Current on-hand is 99 units. Average weekly demand has shifted significantly downward as the season progresses (Period 16-18 average is ~30 units, compared to the earlier regime of ~125). For Period 19, the promised lead time is 2, so the OR engine targets demand over 3 periods (L+1). A base stock calculation using L=2 and mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (~46 units/week * 3 = 138) would result in zero ordering because the OR engine 'thinks' the pipeline is 644. To force a replacement order and maintain a service level near 50% (since profit=holding cost), mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Units). Using a mean of 50 for the current low-demand summer season, Desired Base Stock \u2248 150. Adding 449 ghost units yields 599. I will use 650 to ensure we stay ahead of the technical cap and maintain inventory for the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Current demand has entered a low-season regime (Period 15-18) averaging ~40 units/week, a 60%+ drop from the previous 125/week regime. Ghost inventory of 449 units remains in-transit count.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Tights) has entered a low-season demand regime, with the last 5 weeks (P15-P19) averaging approximately 33 units per week, significantly down from the earlier 125 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 84 units, which covers about 2.5 weeks of current demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 644 units is heavily distorted by 449 'ghost' units from lost shipments in P1, P3, and P4. The remaining 195 units in the pipeline (ordered in P13, P17, etc.) plus current on-hand already exceed several weeks of demand. Given the low-season regime and the high holding cost (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period window to reflect the lower demand. I will continue using the 'explicit' mu_hat strategy to offset the 449 ghost units: Target Base Stock = (1+L)*mean_recent. With L=2, mean=33, target base stock is ~100. Adding 449 gives an explicit mu_hat of 549. This ensures the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculates a non-negative requirement if needed, though with current stock levels and pipeline, a zero-order outcome is expected and appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a low-season regime (P15-P19) averaging ~33 units/week. Ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) persists in the systemic in-transit count, requiring mu_hat inflation of +449 to normalize order logic.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st. The product is 30 denier tights (Women's Nightwear/Socks & Tights). Demand has significantly dropped into a low-season regime starting around Period 15, with the last 5 weeks (P16-P20) averaging approximately 22 units per week (25, 37, 29, 15, 5), which is a major shift from the Spring average of ~125. The systemic 'In-transit' count of 644 units is heavily distorted by 449 'ghost' units (P1, P3, P4) that are confirmed lost. The true pipeline and on-hand inventory (79 on-hand + (644-449) in-transit = 274 total) is sufficient to cover about 12 weeks of current demand at 22 units/week. Therefore, I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for the ghost inventory to prevent the OR engine from ordering more, while accurately reflecting the low-season demand. Target Base Stock at L=2 (3 periods) at 22 units/week is ~66 units. To neutralize the 449 ghost units in the pipeline calculation (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), I set mu_hat to 515 (66 + 449). This ensures the OR engine calculation (515 - 644) results in no new orders, which is optimal given our current over-stocked position relative to low summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Low-season (summer) demand for tights averaging ~22 units/week (P16-P20). Ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) persists in the systemic in-transit count.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is 2019/07/08 (Period 22). The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which is highly seasonal. Demand has collapsed from an average of ~125 (Feb-May) to ~17/week over the last 7 weeks (P15-P21), and just ~4.5/week over the last two weeks, typical for summer months in the northern hemisphere. The systemic 'In-transit' count is 644 units, but this contains 449 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P1: 144, P3: 117, P4: 188). The true pipeline is 195 units (P13: 28, P17: 83, P21: 0, plus previous recent residuals). On-hand is 75 units. At the current demand rate of <10 units/week, the 75 units on-hand plus ~195 units in the true pipeline are more than sufficient. However, because the OR engine subtracts the full 644 in-transit from its target, it won't order anything until the pipeline clears. To prevent potential future stockouts if demand ramps back up, I continue to use an explicit mu_hat inflation logic: Target Base Stock + Ghost Inventory. For low-season, a target weekly average of 15 units is appropriate. Therefore, mu_hat = (1 + L) * 15 + 449. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 15) + 449 = 494. This offsets the ghost inventory and maintains a 45-unit buffer.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed summer low-season demand: averaged ~8 units/week over P19-P21, down significantly from P15-P18 (~37/week). Ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) still persists in systemic in-transit.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which exhibits significant summer seasonality. As of Period 23 (July 15), demand has dropped drastically to an average of ~7 units/week over the last 4 weeks (P19-P22), compared to 125 units/week in the spring. There is a persistent systemic issue where 449 units from P1, P3, and P4 are 'ghost' inventory\u2014they are recorded in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The total in-transit shown is 644. Subtracting the ghost units (644 - 449) reveals an actual pipeline of 195 units (likely comprising the 28 units from P13, 83 units from P17, etc., though some of these are also severely overdue and may be lost). On-hand inventory is 62 units. Given current demand is <15 units/week, the combined on-hand and actual pipeline (>250 units) is more than sufficient for the summer months. I am setting parameters to hold ordering. mu_hat is set to a value lower than the 'ghost' pipeline to ensure the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) results in zero orders.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-season demand is established at ~10 units/week. Ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) persists in the 'In-transit' count and must be factored into all planning until the system clears them.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 111586001 (Shape Up Tights) is currently in a deep summer low-season. Demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) has averaged approximately 10 units per week (15, 5, 4, 13, 12). On-hand inventory is 50 units, which covers 5 weeks of current demand. However, the system still reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 644 units, which includes 449 units confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4. The actual functional pipeline is only 195 units (644 - 449). While the functional pipeline + on-hand (245 units) is more than sufficient for the summer low, the OR engine sees 694 units (On-hand 50 + Pipeline 644) and will not place orders. Because current inventory is high relative to summer demand, no immediate replacement ordering is required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (covering the transition to and the duration of the low season) to reflect this reduced volume while maintaining the 'calculate' method for lead time as deliveries have stabilized at roughly 2 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. The product (30 denier tights) is in a deep summer low-season. Demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) has averaged approximately 9 units/week (15, 5, 4, 13, 12, 5). On-hand inventory is 45 units, which covers about 5 weeks of current demand. However, the system still reports an In-transit balance of 644 units. As documented in carry-over insights, 449 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. The 'real' pipeline is 195 units (644 - 449). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, mu_hat must be inflated. The base stock target for a lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage) at ~9 units/week is roughly 27-35 units. Since on-hand (45) + true in-transit (195) = 240, which is far above the required stock, no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to 'default' and L to 'default' as the current inventory is more than sufficient even with the lead-time uncertainty and the systemic bias. The ghost units essentially force 'ordered=0' which is the correct action given the overstocked position relative to summer demand.

Carry-over insight: Summer low-season demand (P19-P24) is stable at ~9 units/week. Ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) remains in the systemic 'In-transit' count, but current on-hand + legitimate pipeline is sufficient for the low-season regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is 'Shape Up 30 den Tights', which exhibits significant seasonality. Current date is August 5 (Period 26), which is the end of the summer low-season. Demand over the last 7 periods (P19-P25) has averaged ~10 units/week. However, tights typically see demand increases starting in late August/September (Period 29+). The 'ghost' inventory of 449 units (from P1, P3, P4) is still in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 644). The 'real' pipeline is 195 units (644 minus 449). Current on-hand is 30. Total real position is 225 units. At the current low-season demand of ~10/week, this covers 20+ weeks. Even if demand triples to ~30-40/week for the shoulder season, 225 units provides ample coverage. Therefore, I will use a mu_hat that reflects both the current low-season mean and the 'ghost' inventory to prevent the OR engine from further inflating the stock, while keeping the lead time at the promised 2 periods as recent arrivals (P15, P12) were stable.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is August 12, 2019. We are in the depths of the summer low-season for tights (SKU 111586001). Demand over the last 8 periods (P19-P26) has averaged ~15 units per week, significantly lower than the ~125 units seen in early spring. Period 26 showed a slight uptick to 45 units, but it is not yet a sustained trend. The systemic 'In-transit' count of 644 units contains 449 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4) which will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline is 195 units (P13, P15, P17 orders); however, the OR backend sees 644 units. At a current demand of ~15/week and with 0 on-hand inventory, we need to ensure the system is not blocked from ordering by this ghost stock. However, given the extreme low season, even the legitimate in-transit and existing inventory likely cover the needs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current summer demand regime (~15 units/week) while keeping L at default (2). To bypass the 449 ghost units in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover (Target Base Stock + 449). With L=2, base stock for a 15/week demand is roughly 45. Adding 449 brings the explicit mu_hat to approximately 494. This ensures that if the true pipeline drops below 'natural demand', a replacement order is triggered.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a higher demand regime as we move out of the summer low-season (July/August). Demand in Period 26 and 27 spiked to 45 and 79, significantly higher than the summer average of ~10. Current on-hand is 0. The system reports In-transit as 644, but 'ghost' inventory from early periods (P1: 144, P3: 117, P4: 188) totaling 449 units is confirmed lost. Therefore, the 'true' pipeline is 644 - 449 = 195 units. To trigger a replenishment order that accounts for the fact that these 449 units do not exist, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. For Period 28, I estimate demand at ~80 units per week based on recent signals. Target base stock = (L+1) * 80 = 3 * 80 = 240 units. The OR engine calculates: Order = Base Stock - In-transit. To get 240 units of total actual inventory, I need the backend to see a Base Stock of 240 + 449 = 689. Thus, I set mu_hat explicitly to 689. I use L=2 (promised) as recent shipments (P8, P12, P15) confirmed this lead time after the earlier disruptions.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: Summer low-season ending (P26-P27 demand up to 45-79 from previous ~10). Ghost inventory of 449 units remains in-transit count, requiring mu_hat inflation equal to current desired base stock plus 449.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'Shape Up 30 den Tights' is entering its post-summer peak season (Late August). Demand has surged from a summer average of ~10 units/week to a recent 3-period average of 60 units/week (P26: 45, P27: 79, P28: 56). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports an in-transit pipeline of 689 units, but 449 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost 'ghost' stock. The effective pipeline is only 240 units (689 - 449). To ensure the OR engine places an order, mu_hat must be set to the target base stock plus the 449 'ghost' units. Using a forecast mean of 75 units/period (anticipating continued seasonal growth) and L=2, the target base stock is (1+2)*75 = 225 units. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 225 + 449 = 674. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the increased volatility during this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand surge confirmed: P26-P28 demand averages 60 units/week, up from summer baseline of 10. Ghost inventory of 449 units remains in-transit count.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/09/02. We are entering the post-summer demand regime for tights. Demand in the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 45, 79, 56, 54, averaging ~58.5 units/week. This is a significant increase from the summer low of ~10 units/week. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count is 689, but this includes 449 'ghost' units from P1, P3, and P4 which were confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 689 - 449 = 240 units (likely the P28 order of 45 plus subsequent automated orders not yet shown as 'concluded'). To ensure the OR engine orders enough replacement stock, I must set mu_hat such that the base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) minus the system-perceived pipeline (689) results in an order that meets the new demand regime. The target base stock for a 3-week window (L+1=3) at 60 units/week is ~180 plus safety stock. To bypass the 449 ghost units, I set mu_hat to (180 + 449) = 629. This forces the system to recognize that 449 units currently in 'in-transit' are not available for fulfilling future demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P26-P29) confirmed at ~60 units/week. 449 'ghost' units remain in systemic in-transit count.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for tights has significantly increased as we exit the summer period and move into September (Autumn), with Period 30 demand spiking to 147 units. The post-summer regime (P26-P30) now averages 76.2 units/week, up from the summer low of ~10. However, the system still carries 449 'ghost' units in-transit (from P1, P3, P4) that will never arrive. Current 'In-transit' is 644, but actual valid pipeline is only 195 (644 - 449). To trigger an order that compensates for the lost stock and meets the new higher demand, mu_hat must be set to the desired Base Stock + 449. Assuming a 3-week cover (L+1=3) at the recent average of ~76 units, the target base stock is ~228. Adding the 449 ghost units yields a mu_hat of 677. Sigma remains high due to the recent volatility of the seasonal transition.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand shift confirmed: Demand accelerated from ~60 in Aug to 147 in early Sept. New regime (P26-P30) average is 76.2 units/week. 449 units of ghost inventory persist in 'In-transit' count.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for tights is surging as we move into the peak autumn season (September). Recent weekly demand has spiked from ~60 to 203. The current 5-period average (P27-P31) is 107 units/week, but the most recent two weeks (147, 203) suggest a much higher regime of ~175. I will set mu_hat to cover this higher anticipated demand (L+1 = 3 weeks). A critical systemic issue persists: 449 units from P1, P3, and P4 are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count. To force the OR engine to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat by these 449 'ghost' units. Without this, the engine sees 677 in-transit and 0 on-hand, concludes the pipeline is sufficient (677 > base stock), and orders 0. By setting mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + 449), the logic becomes: Order = (Base Stock + 449) - (True Pipeline + 449), which correctly calculates the order based on actual stock. Required Base Stock for 175 units/week across 3 periods is ~525 plus a safety buffer. Total mu_hat = ~525 + 449 = 974.

Carry-over insight: Peak demand regime confirmed: Sept demand accelerating (147, 203) following summer low. Ghost inventory of 449 units still persists in systemic 'In-transit' count.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 111586001 (Shape Up Tights) is currently in its autumn peak demand regime. Demand has accelerated rapidly from ~60 units/week in August to 215 units in Period 32. The system still carries 449 units of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline count. To ensure the OR backend generates sufficient replacement orders, I must use 'mu_hat' to set an explicit target base stock that bypasses this ghost inventory. Calculation: (Expected weekly demand * (L+1)) + ghost inventory. Based on the last 3 weeks (147, 203, 215), the current mean demand is ~188 units. With L=2, the required physical base stock is approx 188 * 3 = 564. Adding the 449 ghost units results in a mu_hat of ~1013. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 15% of demand to maintain a high service level during this peak season.

Carry-over insight: Peak demand regime for tights confirmed (Sept demand: 147, 203, 215). Ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) persists in the systemic in-transit count, necessitating mu_hat inflation equal to (Target_Base_Stock + 449).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering its peak demand season (September/October), with demand surging from ~60/week to 344/week in the most recent period. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P30-P33) is 227.25 units/week. Systemic 'In-transit' inventory is 1013 units, but 449 of these units (from P1, P3, and P4) are confirmed lost 'ghost' stock that will never arrive. The true legitimate pipeline is therefore 1013 - 449 = 564 units. At the current demand level of ~344, the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of cover) should be approximately 1032 units (344 * 3). However, the OR engine's pipeline check sees 1013 units. To force the engine to order the necessary replacement units, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - Total_In_Transit' equals the desired order. To reach a base stock of ~1032, and accounting for the 449 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1481 (1032 + 449). This ensures the backend covers the real demand while bypassing the 'inflated' pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand has accelerated sharply in P33 (344 units), exceeding the initial post-summer recovery. The 449 units of ghost inventory (P1, P3, P4) remain the primary constraint on the OR engine's automated logic.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '111586001' (Shape Up Tights) is currently in its peak seasonal demand regime (October), with recent weekly demand historically spiking between 200 and 344 units. The primary planning challenge is the 449 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, and 4) that still reside in the system's 'In-transit' count. Since the OR engine's logic is 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)', these 449 invisible units prevent the engine from ordering sufficient stock to meet the current high demand. To bypass this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to the desired 'Target Base Stock + 449'. We estimate the current weekly demand regime around 300 units (mean of P33-P34). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the required safety coverage is for (L+1) = 3 periods. Target Base Stock \u2248 3 * 300 = 900. Adding the 449 ghost unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of ~1349. Sigma_hat is set to a high explicit value of 150 to ensure the policy remains responsive to the current high-volatility peak season. Current on-hand is 0, so maximizing coverage immediately is critical to avoid further stockouts during this high-profit window.

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand (Oct) for tights is established at ~300 units/week (P33-P34). Persistent 449-unit ghost inventory continues to require mu_hat inflation to trigger correct replacement orders.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in peak season (October for tights), with demand averaging ~324 units over the last three weeks (P33-P35: 344, 311, 317). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The systemic 'In-transit' count is 1184 units, but this includes a cumulative 449 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory from P1, P3, and P4 that will never arrive. The actual functioning pipeline is 735 units (1184 - 449), consisting of orders from P33 (72), P34 (468), and P35 (0). Lead time has shown some volatility (L=3 for the P32 order), but L=2 is the best estimate for planning. To trigger a correct order from the OR engine, mu_hat must be inflated to counteract the 449 ghost units. Target Base Stock for L=2 (3 periods of coverage) at ~324 units/week is ~972. Adding 449 units to bypass the systemic pipeline error results in a mu_hat calculation based on (972 + 449) / 3 \u2248 474 per week. I set mu_hat to 1422 (474 * 3) and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure high service levels during the peak stockout-prone period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/10/21, which is deep into the peak autumn season for tights. Recent demand (P33-P36) has averaged 309.5 units/week. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are slightly unstable, with recent deliveries (P32, P33) arriving in 3 periods instead of the promised 2. Our most critical constraint is the 449 'ghost' units from P1, P3, and P4 that remain in the 'In-transit' count; the OR engine thinks these units will arrive, so it under-orders. To fix this, I must explicitly set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + 449). For a (L+1)=3 week horizon at ~310 units/week, the expected demand is 930. Adding safety stock for high volatility and compensating for the 449 ghost units, I am setting mu_hat to 1650 (approx 1200 base stock + 450 ghost). This should trigger an order of sufficient size to replenish stock and cover 2-3 weeks of peak demand.

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand (Oct) confirmed at ~310 units/week (P33-P36 average). Lead time is fluctuating between 2-3 periods. Ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) persists and requires mu_hat inflation of ~450 to maintain correct stock levels.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the peak demand season for tights (late October). Demand over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) has settled at a high regime, averaging approximately 312 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 1650 units. However, this includes 449 'ghost' units from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) that were never purged. The 'true' pipeline consists of orders from P34 (468), P36 (238), and P37 (300), totaling 1006 units. To maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3 weeks of demand), we need a base stock of roughly 936 units (312 * 3). Because the OR engine subtracts the ghost inventory (449) from its calculations, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure it orders enough to cover the actual demand plus the gap created by the ghost stock. I will set mu_hat to 1385 (approx 936 + 449) and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high volatility observed during this peak season (~40-50 per week standard deviation).

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand (Oct/Nov) is stable at ~312 units/week. Ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) continues to distort the systemic in-transit count, requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 111586001 (Shape Up Tights) is in its peak demand season (September-November), with demand stabilizing around 310 units/week despite recent stockouts. The inventory system currently shows 1350 units 'In-transit', but this includes 449 units of 'ghost inventory' from periods 1, 3, and 4 that were confirmed lost in Period 11. To ensure the OR engine triggers necessary replenishment orders, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to bypass this 449-unit systemic error. Observed lead times recently fluctuated between 1-3 periods, so I will maintain L at the default promised 2 periods for planning. The base stock target (\u03bc\u0302 + z\xb7\u03c3\u0302) must be high enough to cover (L+1) weeks of demand (~310 * 3 = 930) plus the 449 ghost units. Setting mu_hat explicitly to 1400 (roughly 950 + 450) will force the backend to maintain a physical safety stock despite the ghost units in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Peak season demand (Oct/Nov) is stable at ~310 units/week. Systemic ghost inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) persists, requiring mu_hat inflation equal to Target Base Stock + 449 to maintain availability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 111586001 is in peak season (high-denier tights in November), with demand averaging ~300 units/week over the last 7 periods (P33-P39). There is a systemic 'ghost' inventory of 449 units from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4) that remains in the 'In-transit' count, which prevents the OR backend's automated logic from ordering sufficient stock. Specifically, the observed pipeline is 1155, but the 'true' actionable pipeline is 706 (1155 - 449). To maintain a target base stock for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at 310 units/week, we need a base stock of roughly 930 units. To force the OR backend [which calculates Order = Base Stock - Pipeline] to ignore the 449 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to effectively cover the intended base stock PLUS the ghost units. Target Base Stock (~930) + Ghost (449) = 1379. Using mu_hat = 1380 ensures that the ordering process proceeds as if the ghost units do not exist, ensuring continuous availability during the peak demand window.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in its peak demand season (Nov/Dec) for tights. Recent demand (P33-P40) is stable at ~312 units/week. A persistent ghost inventory of 449 units (from P1, P3, P4) remains in the 'In-transit' count, which the OR engine incorrectly counts as available pipeline. Lead times have been fluctuating between 1-3 periods (Recent observed: P37=1, P36=3, P32=3, P31=1). To maintain stock for peak season, I need a target base stock that covers (L+1) periods. Using L=2 as the planning baseline, base stock should be ~936 units (312 * 3). To force the OR engine to order this amount while it incorrectly sees 449 ghost units, I must set mu_hat (which approximates base stock when z is low or profit/holding is 1:1) to approximately 936 + 449 = 1385. This ensures the engine doesn't under-order due to the systemic reporting error.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/11/25, which is peak season for tights (30 denier). Demand has been consistently high since late September, averaging ~304 units/week over the last 9 periods (P33-P41). Lead times are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a value of L=2 is a reasonable central estimate. A persistent issue exists where 449 units from P1, P3, and P4 are permanently lost but remain in the systemic 'In-transit' count (1,342 units total). To obtain a target base stock of approximately 912 units (3 periods of 304/week demand), the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) would normally result in zero orders because 1342 > 912. Therefore, I must explicitly set mu_hat to approximately 1361 (Target Base Stock of 912 + 449 ghost units) to force the backend to place an order that replaces sold stock. Since Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the backend targets the 50th percentile (mean), so setting mu_hat is the most direct way to control the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits strong seasonality for tights, currently in the peak winter regime (Oct-Nov demand ~310/week). Demand in Period 42 spiked to 355 units. On-hand is 0, and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline. There are 449 units of 'ghost' inventory from Periods 1, 3, and 4 that are permanently lost but remain in the OR engine's systemic in-transit count. To force the OR engine to order sufficiently for a target base stock of ~950-1000 units (covering L+1 weeks @ 320/week), mu_hat must be set to explicitly override the pipeline distortion. Total systemic in-transit is 1361; subtracting 449 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 912 units. To maintain safety stock and cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (likely including a final December peak before the game ends), mu_hat is set to (Target Base Stock + 449). Target base stock for L=2 (3 weeks coverage) at 320 units/week is ~960. Adding the 449 ghost offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1409. Sigma_hat is set using recent volatility (N=10) to reflect the recent demand range (266-355).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/12/09. Demand is in a high-season peak (Oct-Nov avg ~310/week), though Period 43 saw a drop to 197. Historically, tights/hosiery demand remains elevated through December. The 'ghost' inventory of 449 units (P1, P3, P4) persists in the system's in-transit count (1179 total - 449 ghost = 730 real pipeline). Period 42 (19 units) and Period 43 (48 units) are still in transit and within normal lead time windows. To maintain a base stock that covers ~3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~300 units/week, we require ~900 units. Since the OR engine subtracts the full 1179 (including 449 ghost units) from its base stock calculation, I must explicitly set mu_hat to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Units) = 900 + 449 = 1349. This ensures the OR engine places an order to replace the 449 lost units and cover current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for tights is in peak season, averaging ~300 units/week (last 4 periods: 325, 290, 355, 197, 319). Period 45 corresponds to late December, where demand remains high before a potential post-holiday drop. We continue to manage the 'ghost inventory' of 449 units (from P1, P3, and P4) which remains in the systemic in-transit count but will never arrive. To ensure the OR engine places necessary orders, mu_hat must be set to the desired Base Stock + 449. Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, a safe target base stock for this phase (L=2) is approximately (1+2) * 310 = 930 units. Adding the 449 ghost units yields a mu_hat of ~1379. However, the system's current 'In-transit' is 1316. Since 1316 - 449 = 867 (actual pipeline), and our target is ~930, a small top-up order is warranted. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the peak demand + ghost correction.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday season (Late December) for tights. Demand in Period 45 peaked at 475, significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~310. The last 3 periods average ~330 units/week. With on-hand at 0 and 'ghost' inventory of 449 units still inflating the systemic pipeline (In-transit: 1313 contains 449 lost units), we must adjust our target. True pipeline is 1313 - 449 = 864 units. At a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need (L+1) coverage (~3-4 weeks). A target base stock for this regime is ~1200-1300 units. To bypass the OR engine's use of the inflated 1313 in-transit figure, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Units). Target Base Stock Calculation: 330 units/week * 4 periods = 1320. mu_hat = 1320 + 449 = 1769.

Carry-over insight: Holiday peak demand confirmed: P45 reached 475 units. December average is effectively ~330 units/week. Lead time is averaging ~2.5 periods (ranges 1-3). Ghost inventory remains at 449 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak holiday/winter season for tights, with recent demand averaging ~340 units/week (P43-P46: 197, 319, 475, 462). The 'ghost' inventory of 449 units (from P1, P3, P4) remains in the system's in-transit count (total 1769), which prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders because it incorrectly assumes these units will arrive. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers the desired base stock plus the 449 ghost units. A safe base stock for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) at 340 units/week is roughly 1020 units. Adding the 449 ghost units gives a target mu_hat of ~1469. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the order is triggered despite the systemic error. On-hand is currently 0, and we are experiencing stockouts during this high-demand period.
