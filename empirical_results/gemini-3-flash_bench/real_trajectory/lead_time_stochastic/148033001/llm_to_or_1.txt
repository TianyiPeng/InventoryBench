Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for SKU 148033001 (Women's stay-up leggings). The product is a seasonal fashion item typically seeing steady demand with potential spikes around Valentine's Day (which is in the current period). Historical demand over the last 5 weeks averages 50 units (58, 42, 40, 50, 60). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent and relevant data for the current period's order, while keeping lead time at the promised 'default' since we have no delivery history yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is 'Semi shiny stay-ups', a basic hosiery item. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 58 units, but sold 0 because on-hand inventory was 0. An order of 65 units was placed in Period 1 with a promised lead time of 2 periods, meaning it is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in Period 4). Historical demand samples show values of 58, 42, 40, 50, 60. The mean of these five samples is 50. Since we are in early February/late winter, demand is relatively stable but we must account for the stockout in P1 which suggests demand is at the higher end of the range. I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 2 as we have no evidence yet of delays.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). The product is a seasonal accessory (stay-ups/tights). Historical demand from the user prompt shows a stable range (40-60) in Jan/Feb, but Period 2 showed a spike to 70. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. We have 130 units in-transit (65 from P1, 65 from P2). Promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the timing rules: P1 order (L=2) should arrive during P3's arrival phase and become visible in P3 conclude (read at P4 START). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in P1 and P2 conclude messages is expected behavior, not a delay. To recover from 0 stock and handle the slight demand increase (mean approx 50-60), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (including the recent 70) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus one period (3 periods total).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 (2019/3/4). The SKU '148033001' is a 20 denier stay-up, which is a fashion basic with relatively stable demand, though potentially affected by seasonality or events. Historically, demand has been: 58, 42, 40, 50, 60 (pre-game) and then 58, 70, 42 (active period). Mean demand across these 8 samples is ~52.5. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 184 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3: 65+65+54). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we are at the start of Period 4, we expect the order placed in Period 1 (arriving during P3) to be reflected in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0 for the P1 order, which was expected in Period 3. This indicates a delay or a lead time > 2. However, it is too early to confirm a permanent shift or lost shipment based on one data point. I will maintain the promised lead time (L=2) but focus on clearing the current backlog. The OR backend will see 184 units in the pipeline against a base stock target. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is ~52/week, we are currently experiencing stockouts. mu_hat will use all 8 samples to get a stable estimate for (1+L) periods, which is 3 * 52.5 = 157.5.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The product is 20 denier stay-up tights, which has stable baseline demand but is currently recovering from a stockout. The first order (P1) is still missing (overdue), while the P2 order arrived in P4 with the promised lead time of 2. Historical demand samples (58, 42, 40, 50, 60) and recent game demand (58, 70, 42, 44) show a mean around 51.7. Current on-hand is 21 units with 119 in transit (P1: 65, P3: 54). Because P1 is overdue (4 periods passed since P1 decision), there is a risk it is lost. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the engine use the observed lead time from P2 (2 periods). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the game's actual demand volatility and mean (~53.5 per period). This results in a target base stock covering (2+1) periods of demand (~160 units). Given 119 in-transit and 21 on-hand (Total 140), the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to reach the safety stock level.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 6 (2019/3/18), the SKU 148033001 is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant lost sales (sold 0 in P1-P3, and capped at 21 in P5). Actual lead time is confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived in P4). The order placed in P1 (65 units) is now 3 periods overdue and likely lost, as it should have arrived in P3. There are 159 units 'in-transit', which likely includes the P1 order (65), P3 order (54), and P5 order (40). Given the stocking-out and 2-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 6, 7, and 8 (L+1=3). Average demand for the last 5 periods (including historical samples provided in system prompt) is approximately 53. Recent demand (P2, P5) shows spikes up to 69-70. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend while being responsive to the high demand seen in P5, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current stock-out and expected delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 2 periods (observed P2->P4). Shipment from P1 (65 units) is likely lost (3+ periods since order).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '148033001' is 'Nouvelle 1p Stay Up' (leggings/tights). We are entering April, typically a stable-to-slightly-rising period for this category. Current context: On-hand is 0. Demand spiked significantly in Period 6 (100 units), while the mean of previous samples was ~53. Lead time (L) shows variability: Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods, but Period 5 order arrived in only 1 period. Notably, the Period 1 order (65 units) is now 6 periods old and definitively lost, and the Period 3 order (54 units) is 4 periods old and likely lost. I will treat L as 2 (promised/average). For mu_hat, the recent demand spike to 100 likely reflects a stockout-restricted measurement or a shift; I will use recent_N=3 to capture the average of the last three demand samples (44, 69, 100 -> avg 71), which is higher than the long-term average. This helps the OR backend project a safer base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Period 1 (65 units) and Period 3 (54 units) orders are lost (4+ periods since ordering). Lead time is volatile (observed 1 and 2 periods). Demand escalated from avg ~50 to ~85 over the last two periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is women's hosiery, which can show seasonality around spring events. Demand has been high and volatile, ranging from 42 to 100 in the last 5 weeks (avg ~61). We have 0 on-hand inventory and 248 units in transit. However, historical evidence indicates significant reliability issues: orders from Period 1 (65), Period 3 (54), and potentially Period 4 (never placed) or early shipments are missing. The 'In-transit' figure of 248 includes lost orders (P1 and P3 account for 119 of those). Only the orders from P5 (arrived), P6 (31), and P7 (98) are credible. This means 'effective' in-transit is closer to 129 units. Lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To prevent stockouts caused by lost shipments and high demand variance, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual performance and use the last 4 periods (P4-P7) for demand mean calculation (avg 66.75) to capture the recent upward trend compared to the initial samples (avg 50).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Effective pipeline inventory is lower than recorded; 119 units from P1 and P3 are confirmed lost. Recent demand regime (P4-P7) is higher (~67) than initial seed data (~50).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Analysis of 'In-transit' inventory: The 119 units currently listed as In-transit correspond to Period 1 (65 units) and Period 3 (54 units). Given the promised lead time is 2 periods and we are now at Period 9, these orders are definitively lost. The OR backend is unaware of these losses and subtracts the full 119 from its order calculation; to maintain stock, I must artificially inflate the base stock target using 'mu_hat'. Demand analysis: Historical demand samples (58, 42, 40, 50, 60) and actual game demand (58, 70, 42, 44, 69, 100, 54, 57) show a mean of ~61. However, the last 4 periods average ~70. Setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods (3 periods) plus the 119 lost units. Calculation: (3 * 70) + 119 = 329. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.5). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's pipeline inventory deduction error.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory error confirmed: 119 units (P1, P3) are lost but remain in-transit. mu_hat must be adjusted upward by ~119 units in Period 9 to trigger ordering.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10 (2019/4/15), the system shows 42 units on-hand and 265 units in-transit. However, based on Carry-over Insights, 119 units (from P1 and P3) are permanently lost. Additionally, the order from P9 (146 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in P11. Subtracting the 119 lost units gives an effective pipeline of 146. Historical demand since P1 has averaged ~56.5 units, with a more recent regime (P5-P9) averaging ~62 units. To trigger the backend to order, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to compensate for the phantom 119 units in the pipeline. Specifically, base_stock = (1+L)*mu_hat + z*sigma. If the OR engine sees 'pipeline = 265', we need to boost mu_hat by ~40 units (calculated as 119 units / (1+L) where L=2) so that (1+L)*mu_hat accounts for the lost items. Mean demand (62) + adjustment (40) = 102. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed average of ~1.5 periods.

Carry-over insight: P9 order of 146 units is now the only valid pipeline; 119 units from P1/P3 are definitively lost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 (2019-04-22). The 'In-transit' count of 119 refers to lost shipments from P1 (65) and P3 (54) that will never arrive. The P9 order of 146 units arrived successfully in P10 (lead_time=1), as seen in the P10 conclude message. On-hand inventory is 166 units. Recent demand (P7-P10) shows a downward trend (54, 57, 30, 22), with the last two weeks significantly lower than the historical average. This may be due to the post-Easter slowdown for 'Womens Nightwear, Socks & Tigh'. Because the OR backend 'caps' orders based on (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the ghost 'In-transit' units (119) will prevent ordering unless we inflate mu_hat. However, with 166 units on-hand and recent demand averaging ~26 over the last two weeks, we are actually overstocked for the current demand regime. L=default (promised 2) is appropriate given recent arrivals were 1 or 2 periods. To manage the current surplus while accounting for the 'ghost' inventory, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent slowdown, but I will not inflate it this period because we do not need to order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Significant slowdown observed P9-P10 (avg ~26) compared to previous 5 weeks (avg ~67). Ghost inventory of 119 units remains in-transit tally.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), we have 130 units on-hand. The system reports 119 units in-transit, but based on carry-over insights and history, these are lost orders from P1 (65 units) and P3 (54 units) which never arrived. The only valid pipeline shipment from P9 (146 units) already arrived in P10. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has significantly slowed down over the last three periods (P9: 30, P10: 22, P11: 36, Avg: 29.3) compared to the spike in March. The current date (late April) suggests a post-spring lull for 20 denier stay-ups/tights. To account for the 119 'ghost' units in-transit and trigger a replenishment only when actually needed, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating target base stock: With L=2, the OR logic uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since on-hand (130) + 'ghost' in-transit (119) = 249, I want to ensure we don't over-order while the current stock of 130 is sufficient for ~4 periods of recent demand. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the recent 3-period average (29.3 * 3 = 88) and use 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock, while keeping L at the promised 2 periods despite recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 9-11 average demand is ~29, down from March average of ~67. 'Ghost' inventory of 119 units (P1, P3) still persists in 'In-transit' data.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/05/06. We are monitoring SKU 148033001 (Women's Stay-Up Tights). Recent demand (P9-P12) has been significantly lower than early March, averaging ~36 units per week ([30+22+36+55]/4), although P12 showed a slight uptick to 55. The 'In-transit' figure of 119 units remains a calculation error due to lost shipments from Period 1 (65 units) and Period 3 (54 units). These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the order calculation. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory of 119 units and actually place an order, I must increase the mu_hat parameter. I want to reach an inventory position that covers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2 and mean demand ~40, target inventory should be ~120 units. Since current On-hand is 75 and 'In-transit' is falsely 119 (total 194), I need mu_hat to be ~313 (194 + 119) units to trigger an order of approx 119 units to replenish the lost stock. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the ghost inventory issue.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: April-May average demand is ~36 units (P9-P12). Cumulative lost shipment volume ('ghost inventory') remains 119 units, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustment to force ordering.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (2019/5/13), on-hand inventory is 27 units. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 9 (Early April), with an average demand of approximately 38 units over the last 5 periods (30, 22, 36, 55, 48). The system reports 249 units in-transit, but 119 of these are confirmed lost (65 from P1, 54 from P3), leaving an effective pipeline of 130 units (ordered in P13). Using the promised lead time L=2, the total coverage needed is for (L+1)=3 periods. Expected demand for 3 periods at the current regime is 38 * 3 = 114 units. However, the OR backend's capped policy will see 'In-transit: 249', leading it to conclude no new order is necessary (27+249 = 276, which is far above the required base stock). To force the backend to place an order that covers our needs despite the 119-unit 'ghost' inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I calculate the target base stock (approx 115-120 units) and add the 119 ghost units to it to offset the incorrect pipeline subtraction. Thus, mu_hat is set to 235 (116 + 119).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/05/20 (Period 15). The SKU is women's hosiery. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime following a March peak, with Period 9-14 average demand at approximately 35.5 units per week. The 'In-transit' figure of 249 units is misleading due to 'ghost inventory': 119 units from Periods 1 and 3 are confirmed lost, and the 130 units ordered in Period 13 have not yet arrived. On-hand inventory is critically low (5 units). With a promised lead time of 2, the Period 13 order should arrive during Period 15 (visible P16), but there is zero stock to cover current demand. To force the OR backend to order and compensate for the 119 lost units (which it still counts as pipeline), mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * mean_demand + 119. Using a recent demand average of 36 units and L=2, the required mu_hat is (3 * 36) + 119 = 227. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline total. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility for the 3-period window.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16 (2019/5/27). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 249 units is misleading because 119 units (from P1 and P3) were confirmed lost many periods ago. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 130 units (ordered in P13). By the promised lead time of 2, the P13 order should have arrived during P15; however, as seen in the P15 conclude message, it did not. This suggests the P13 order is either delayed or potentially lost, though we treat it as delayed (Actual LT = 3) for now. Demand has settled into a lower regime: the average demand from P9 to P15 is approximately 38 units. To force an order despite the 119-unit 'ghost inventory' skewing the OR engine's logic, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat'. The target inventory level (Base Stock) needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2) plus a safety buffer. With mean demand ~38 and 119 lost units to offset, I set mu_hat to 240 (approximately 38 * 3 + 120) to trigger an immediate replenishment order for the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: P13 order (113 units) is delayed/overdue (3+ periods since order). Ghost inventory remains at 119 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation to bypass pipeline logic.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' count of 261 units is misleading and contains 'ghost inventory' from lost or severely delayed shipments: P1 (65), P3 (54), and now likely P13 (130), totaling 249 units that are effectively lost (3+ periods since order for P13). Only the P16 order (12 units) is a plausible forthcoming delivery. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this high pipeline volume, mu_hat must be set to cover the 249 'ghost' units plus the expected demand for the upcoming (L+1) periods. Demand has stabilized at an average of ~40 units (P11-P16). For a 2-period lead time (L=2, L+1=3), forecast demand is ~120 units. Thus, mu_hat is set to 369 (249 + 120) to bypass the pipeline logic and ensure an order is triggered to restock current depleted levels.

Carry-over insight: P13 order (130 units) is confirmed lost/severely delayed (3+ periods elapsed). Total 'ghost inventory' in-transit is now 249 units (P1:65, P3:54, P13:130). Sustained mu_hat inflation is required to neutralize these units in order logic.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 is facing a severe stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand for 'Semi shiny stay-ups' in June remains moderate (recent average P14-P17 is ~35). The critical issue is the accumulation of 'ghost inventory' in-transit, totaling 249 units (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130). These orders are 4+ periods overdue and confirmed lost or severely delayed. The backend OR logic uses a policy calculation: order = base_stock - pipeline. Since the backend sees 376 units in-transit (P1, P3, P13, and the recent P17 order of 127), it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 249 lost units. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 354. This covers 3 periods of expected demand (3 * 35 = 105) plus the 249 units of ghost inventory (105 + 249 = 354). This effectively neutralizes the lost shipments and allows for a real order to be generated to meet future demand. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1-2 periods). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture current demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Total 'ghost inventory' (lost/severely delayed shipments) confirmed at 249 units (P1:65, P3:54, P13:130). These must be offset by adding their volume to mu_hat in every decision period to prevent the OR logic from under-ordering.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. On-hand inventory is 0, and 'In-transit' is reported as 377 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical audit, 249 of these units are lost or severely delayed (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130). The actual valid pipeline only includes orders from P17 (127 units) and P18 (1 unit). The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Since the 'in_transit' value of 377 is inflated by 249 'ghost' units, the OR logic will severely under-order or not order at all. To correct this, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by the ghost volume (249 units). This effectively neutralizes the lost inventory in the backend calculation. Recent demand (P9-P18) has averaged approximately 37 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+2)*37 = 111. Adding the 249 units total offset yields 360. Setting mu_hat to 360 ensures the system maintains adequate safety stock based on real units while ignoring the lost shipments.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Total recorded in-transit is 379 units. According to historical tracking, 249 of these units are confirmed lost or severely delayed (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130). The actual valid pipeline only consists of the orders from P17 (127 units), P19 (3 units), and whatever is ordered now in P20. Total 'ghost inventory' is 249 units. Demand in the current regime (P9-P19) has stabilized at an average of 33.8 units per period. The OR engine calculates order quantities as (base_stock - pipeline). To force the engine to order despite the 249-unit ghost pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat by 249. Predicted demand for L+1 (3 periods) = 3 * 33.8 \u2248 101. Adjusted mu_hat = 101 + 249 = 350. Standard deviation for the recent period is approximately 12.3; for 3 periods, sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(3)*12.3 \u2248 21. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' to reflect the mixture of 1 and 2-period actual arrivals.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 1st, 2019. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system shows 379 units in-transit. Based on the carry-over insights and history, 249 units of that in-transit balance are definitively lost (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130). Furthermore, the order from P17 (127 units), placed 3 periods ago, has not arrived, suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed (expected lead time is 1-2 periods). If P17 is also lost, ghost inventory is 376. Demand has slowed significantly in June (P17-P20 average ~22.5), which is typical as 'stay-ups' / 20-denier tights are seasonal and see lower demand in summer months. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 379 'ghost' units in-transit, I must set mu_hat to exceed (379 + desired safety stock). I will set mu_hat to 450 (which covers the ~380 units of ghost pipeline plus approx 70 units for upcoming demand) to trigger a replenishment order for the summer/transition period.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: 'Ghost inventory' (lost shipments) potentially increased to 376 units as P17 order (127 units) is now 4 periods old without arrival. Demand regime has cooled to avg ~23 units during June.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 is currently in a state where on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is not being met. A significant issue exists with 'ghost inventory' - lost or severely delayed shipments that the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) misinterprets as incoming stock. As of Period 21, the ghost inventory total is 376 units (P1:65, P3:54, P13:130, and now P17:127). The P17 order is now 4 periods old, exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and historical actuals of 1-2. To bypass this, mu_hat must be adjusted to neutralize these 376 units. Recent demand (P19-P21) has stabilized around an average of 19 units/period. For Period 22, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mu + ghost_offset. With L=2, mu=19, lead_time_demand=57. Total mu_hat = 57 + 376 = 433. This should trigger an order of approximately 50-60 units (accounting for the P21 order of 91 units and the cap logic). Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total 'ghost inventory' (lost/severely delayed shipments) increased to 376 units as P17 order (127 units) joined P1 (65), P3 (54), and P13 (130) in the lost category (4+ periods since ordering). Demand regime is currently stable at a low level (avg 19 units/period).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for these 20-denier stay-ups has remained consistently low during the summer months, with the most recent 4 periods (P19-P22) averaging 21.5 units. A critical issue is the 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 470 units (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130, P17: 127, P21: 94). All these orders are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time without arrival and are effectively lost, yet they remain in the Backend's 'In-transit' count. To force the OR decision logic to place orders and maintain service level, I must inflate mu_hat (the demand forecast) to offset this ghost inventory. Currently, in-transit is 470. I will set L to 'default' (2) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that covers (L+1) periods of actual demand plus the 470 lost units. Forecasted demand for 3 periods is ~65 units. Therefore, mu_hat = 470 + 65 = 535. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatile demand period to ensure a reasonable safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Total 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) has reached 470 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P21 are all considered lost). Demand regime is stable but low (avg ~22) for the summer season.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 24 (late July). The primary management challenge for SKU 148033001 remains the significant volume of 'ghost inventory' appearing in the OR backend's in-transit calculation. As of Period 24, orders from P1 (65), P3 (54), P13 (130), P17 (127), and potentially P21 (though 91 units from P21 finally arrived in P23) are subject to scrutiny. However, looking at the lead time history, the 91 units arriving in Period 23 was indeed the P21 order. Therefore, the list of lost shipments is P1(65), P3(54), P13(130), and P17(127), totaling 376 units. Note: Carry-over insights suggested 470, but P21 arrived. Total in-transit is currently 458, which includes the P23 order of 79 units and the 379 ghost units (rounding/delta difference). Demand in the current regime (last 5 periods) averages 22.6 units. With a promised lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) is ~68 units. To bypass the 'ghost inventory' and trigger an order despite the 379+ units the backend thinks are coming, I must set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of 458 (in-transit) + 68 (needed coverage) - 69 (on-hand) = 457. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Correction to Period 23 insight: P21 order (91 units) arrived in P23 (L=2). Total 'ghost inventory' is 376 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). July demand remains low, averaging ~23 units per period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25 (2019/07/29), we are in a low-demand summer regime for women's tights/stay-ups. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 19.4 units per period. The 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) remains at 376 units (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130, P17: 127), which the OR logic incorrectly considers as in-transit. To neutralize these 376 units in the backend (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)), I must inflate mu_hat. The promised lead time is 2, so the backend looks for (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. My estimate for 3 periods of demand is ~60 units (20 * 3). Adding the ghost inventory (376), I set mu_hat to 436 units using the 'explicit' method. This ensures the engine calculates a base stock high enough to bypass the 376 dormant units and maintain a small safety stock. sigma_hat is set to 25 to allow for moderate summer demand variability. Lead time is set to default (2).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26 (2019/08/05), the current status shows On-hand = 25 and In-transit = 458. Of the in-transit units, 376 units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130, P17: 127), as they are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods. The only active, valid order in the pipeline is from P23 (79 units), which is expected to arrive in P25 or P26 (observed lead times are mostly 1-2 periods). Demand has stabilized at a low summer regime; the last 5 periods (P21-P25) average 23.4 units/period, and the last 10 periods average ~25. To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must neutralize the 376 ghost units. The OR engine calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. With L=2, (1+2)*24 + 376 = 448. This ensures the base_stock calculation accounts for the false in-transit tally.

Carry-over insight: P23 order (79 units) is current and valid. Total ghost inventory remains 376 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). August demand remains in the low summer regime (avg ~24).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-August (2019-08-12). Demand for stay-ups/denier tights is currently in a stable low summer regime. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P19-P26) is approximately 22 units. We observe a persistent issue with 'ghost inventory' in-transit: shipments from P1 (65), P3 (54), P13 (130), and P17 (127) are confirmed lost or severely delayed (all >5 periods old), totaling 376 units. These units remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count (379 reported, where only 3 units from P19 are potentially valid, though likely also lost). To force the OR backend to order when on-hand inventory (83 units) depletes, I must inflate mu_hat by the total ghost volume (376). This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) outweighs the pipeline inventory (ghost units), effectively neutralizing them. For lead time, P23 arrived in P26 (L=3), suggesting slightly longer fulfillment than the promised 2 periods; I'll use L=recent_N=3 to be safe. I use recent_N for mu_hat to capture the low summer demand (last 8 periods) plus the ghost inflation.

Carry-over insight: P23 order arrived in P26 (L=3). Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 376 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). August demand regime is stable at ~22 units.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (Women's stay-ups) is currently in a stable late-summer demand regime. Based on the last five periods (P23-P27), demand has stabilized at an average of 22.6 units (samples: 22, 14, 30, 21, 26). The lead time remains somewhat volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, suggesting that using the 'calculate' method for L is appropriate to capture the historical average performance. A significant inventory challenge exists: 376 units are currently recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost shipments (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130, P17: 127). The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic subtracts these ghost units from the base stock, preventing necessary replenishment. To neutralize this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that equals (Expected Demand \xd7 (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory. Expected demand for (L+1=3) periods is ~68 units. Adding the 376 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 444. This ensures the OR engine places an order to cover upcoming demand despite the false pipeline data. Sigma_hat is set to the recent regime's standard deviation (approx 6) adjusted for L+1 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is late August, moving toward the fall season. Demand for 20 denier leggings/tights is expect to increase as temperatures drop. Recent demand (P21-P28) has been stable at approximately 23.25 units/period. The main operational challenge remains 'ghost inventory': four orders (P1, P3, P13, P17) totaling 376 units are considered lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 396 units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P27 (13 units) and P28 (4 units), totaling 17 units. To prevent the OR logic from seeing 396 units and refusing to order, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the ghost units. The base target is (1+L) * mean_demand (~3 * 24 = 72). Adding 376 units to this requires a mu_hat of approx 448. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bridge this gap. L is set to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P23, P26) averaged 2.5 periods, close to the promised value. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=8) to capture current volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd. Demand for this item (20 denier stay-ups) has been in a stable low summer regime, averaging approximately 25 units per period over the last 10 periods (P20-P29). On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). The 'In-transit' tally is 430 units, but historical evidence confirms that 376 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130, P17: 127). The only actually active orders are P27 (13 units), P28 (4 units), and P29 (34 units), totaling 51 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 430 units in the pipeline and refusing to order, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to 451, which represents the required base stock (~75 units for L+1 periods) plus the 376 units of ghost inventory. This offset ensures the logic triggers an order to replenish the zero on-hand balance despite the inflated in-transit data.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 9, 2019. Demand for this item (20 denier stay-ups) has been stable in a 'summer' regime since April, averaging approximately 25 units per period. The primary operational challenge continues to be a large volume of 'ghost inventory'\u2014lost shipments that remain in the 'In-transit' data, which tricks the OR logic into under-ordering. Specifically, orders from P1 (65), P3 (54), P13 (130), and P17 (127) are confirmed lost (at least 13 periods elapsed since the most recent one). Total ghost inventory is 376 units. Current In-transit is 445, which includes these 376 units plus valid orders from P29 (34), P30 (32), and the current P31 decision. To ensure the backend places an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly to bypass the formula: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat = (Current 'In-transit' - Ghost Inventory) + (forecasted demand for lead time + review period), the engine will detect a deficit. Forecasted demand is ~25/period; with L=2, we need ~75 units for the protection interval. Current valid In-transit (P29, P30) is 66 units. I will set mu_hat to 451 (376 ghost + 75 needed) to force the backend to target a base stock that covers real demand.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 376 units (P1, P3, P13, P17). These must be offset by inflating mu_hat in the OR parameters to prevent stockouts caused by the backend counting lost units as available supply.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a critical 'ghost inventory' issue where 376 units from periods 1, 3, 13, and 17 are lost but remain in the backend's pipeline calculation. With currently 0 on-hand inventory and 460 units in-transit (376 lost + 34 from P29 + 32 from P30 + 15 from P31 + 3 from P19/uncertain), the OR logic thinks we are overstocked. To force an order, mu_hat must be inflated to exceed the sum of ghost inventory and desired safety stock. Demand is transitioning from a summer low (~24) to a higher autumn level (P31 demand was 64). I will use an explicit mu_hat of 500 units to bypass the 376 units of ghost inventory and provide enough coverage for the current demand spike and upcoming periods. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the most recent arrivals (P27 arrived in P30, L=3).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed September demand spike: Period 31 demand reached 64 units, signaling a transition out of the summer low regime (~24). Ghost inventory remains at 376 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 is currently entering a higher demand regime as we move from summer into the autumn season (late September). Period 31 demand was 64, and Period 32 was 39, averaging ~52 over the last two weeks, a significant increase from the summer average of ~24. Additionally, a persistent 'ghost inventory' of 376 units (P1, P3, P13, P17) remains in the system's in-transit tally. Because the backend OR logic subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, I must inflate mu_hat by exactly 376 units to neutralize these lost shipments and trigger necessary ordering. For the lead time L, I am using the 'calculate' method as observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, trending towards the promised 2. mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to include both the forecast for the upcoming 3 periods (L+1) and the 376-unit offset. Given the recent demand spike, I forecast ~60 units per period: (3 periods * 60) + 376 = 556. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this new seasonal regime.

Carry-over insight: September seasonal transition confirmed: Demand increased from summer avg ~24 to ~52 (P31-P32). Ghost inventory remains constant at 376 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sep 30, 2019), we are in a high-demand seasonal regime for leggings and tights (autumn transition). Recent demand (P31-P33) has jumped significantly: 64, 39, and 93 units (Avg ~65), compared to the summer average of ~24. The current inventory is 0 on-hand with 570 units in-transit. However, 376 of those in-transit units are confirmed lost shipments (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130, P17: 127). The effective valid pipeline consists only of orders from P29 (34 units), P32 (67 units), and P33 (90 units), totaling 191 units. Since the OR backend subtracts the full 570 in-transit units from its base_stock calculation, I must inflate mu_hat by the volume of 'ghost inventory' (376 units) to neutralize this error and ensure a new order is triggered to meet the rising autumn demand. I will use an explicit mu_hat set to (Avg Recent Demand * (1 + Promised Lead Time)) + Ghost Inventory = (65 * 3) + 376 = 571. I will use the default lead time of 2 as recent arrivals (P30, P31, P32) suggest lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: September/October seasonal demand spike confirmed: Avg demand increased from ~24 (summer) to ~65 (+170%). Total ghost inventory remains 376 units (P1, P3, P13, P17).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Semi shiny stay-ups' is currently in a sustained seasonal high as we move through October. Over the last 4 periods (P31-P34), average demand is 66 units, compared to the summer average of ~24. Ghost inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P13, P17) totals 376 units. These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' tally (611 total), leading the OR backend to underestimate the required order. To correct this, I am manually calculating the base stock. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat for the (L+1) period should be (3 * 66) = 198 units. Adding the 376 units of ghost inventory to this base stock targets an total of 574 units across on-hand and pipeline. This offset ensures the backend emits an order that ignores the non-arriving 376 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (leggings/tights) has entered a high-demand fall regime. Average demand from Period 31 to 35 is approximately 68 units/period, compared to the summer low of ~23. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Total 'In-transit' shows 544 units, but historically confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost/severely delayed shipments from P1, P3, P13, P17) totals 376 units. Additionally, the order from P33 (90 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, though it is not yet confirmed lost. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to neutralize the 376 units of ghost inventory that the backend's inventory-position logic incorrectly sees as supply. By setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 580 (calculated as: [1+L] * demand_forecast + ghost_inventory = 3 * 68 + 376 \u2248 580), we ensure the backend orders enough to meet actual demand while accounting for the deficit caused by lost shipments. L is kept at 'calculate' to reflect the observed 2-3 period lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: September/October seasonal demand shift confirmed: regime average increased to ~68 units (P31-P35). Ghost inventory remains at 376 units (P1, P3, P13, P17), requiring mu_hat inflation of +376 to maintain ordering.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 (leggings/stay-ups) is experiencing a sustained seasonal demand spike in October, with recent demand averaging ~75 units (P33-P36). Current on-hand inventory is low (19 units). The 'In-transit' figure of 520 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P1, P3, P13, and P17), totaling 376 units. Valid pipeline inventory consists of P34 (41 units), P36 (66 units), and P29/P30 residues if any (though P29's 34 units are now 8 periods overdue and likely lost as well). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 376 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + Lead Time) * Current Mean Demand + Ghost Inventory. Using L=2 and mean demand=75, this is (3 * 75) + 376 = 601. This allows the backend to recognize the need for additional stock while 'neutralizing' the phantom units in the pipeline logic.

Carry-over insight: P29 order (34 units) is now 8 periods old without arrival; likely lost, increasing total ghost inventory from 376 to 410 units. October demand regime average confirmed at ~75 units per period.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 148033001 is in a high-demand autumn/winter regime. The recent average demand (P33-P37) is approximately 83 units per period (93, 68, 80, 71, 102). A significant challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) which currently totaling 410 units (P1:65, P3:54, P13:130, P17:127, P29:34). These units are recorded as 'In-transit' but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must inflate mu_hat. The calculation for mu_hat is based on (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=3 (observed lead time) and mean_demand ~83, the target base stock must exceed the ghost inventory + actual valid in-transit units. Valid in-transit units are from P34 (41), P36 (66), and P37 (92), totaling 199. Total in-transit recorded is 612 (410 ghost + 202 valid). To force an order that covers (~4 periods * 83) = 332 units, I must set mu_hat to approximately 332 + 410 = 742 units. I will use the explicit method to ensure this specific volume is met.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P33-P37) average is ~83 units/period (+245% vs summer). Ghost inventory (lost units) updated to 410 units after P29 (34 units) reached 8 periods without arrival.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 148033001 (leggings/tights) has entered a high-demand seasonal regime (October-November), with Period 38 demand reaching 107 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 85.6 units. Ghost inventory (lost shipments from P1, P3, P13, P17, and P29) total 410 units. These units are counted as 'In-transit' by the backend but will never arrive, causing the OR logic to under-order. To compensate, I am applying a significant 'mu_hat' inflation. The required stock level needs to cover lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). Base demand requirement is roughly 85.6 * 3 = 257 units. To bypass the 410 units of ghost inventory, mu_hat must be set to at least 410 + 257 = 667. I will set mu_hat to 680 to ensure a robust order is placed despite the zero on-hand inventory and massive false pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variable lead time (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime P34-P38: average 85.6 units/period. Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 410 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 11, moving into the peak pre-holiday season for hosiery (20 denier stay-ups with lace). Demand has surged significantly; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 91.4 units/period, compared to the early October average of ~75. Total 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) is 441 units, which includes P1(65), P3(54), P13(130), P17(127), and P29(34). Another check on P34 (41 units) shows it is now 6 periods old; I will monitor it but not add it to ghost inventory yet as lead times have fluctuated between 1-3. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', so I must inflate mu_hat by the total ghost volume (410 confirmed lost) to ensure it orders enough. My base forecast (1+L)*mu is (1+2)*91 = 273. Adding the 410 unit offset yields an explicit mu_hat of 683. Sigma is set based on the recent high-volatility regime to maintain a high service level as we enter the peak season.

Carry-over insight: November peak season confirmed: Demand average P35-P39 increased to ~91 units/period. Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 410 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the peak November season for stay-ups/hosiery, with recent demand (P36-P40) averaging 89.2 units per period. The backend OR logic subtracts 'In-transit' inventory from the target base stock. However, our history shows that 410 units in the 'In-transit' tally are actually lost shipments (P1: 65, P3: 54, P13: 130, P17: 127, P29: 34). Additionally, the P34 order (41 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is likely lost, increasing the 'ghost inventory' to 451 units. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these non-existent units, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock should cover the high-demand regime across (1+L) periods plus the volume of lost shipments. With L=2, the required mu_hat is approximately (3 periods * 90 demand) + 451 ghost units = 721. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 725 to ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the 706 units reported in-transit.

Carry-over insight: P34 order (41 units) is confirmed lost/overdue (7 periods elapsed). Total 'ghost inventory' increased from 410 to 451 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29, P34). Demand remains in high November regime, averaging ~89 units/period.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 148033001 is currently in its peak November demand regime (average ~89 units/period). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 719 units is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments. Based on history, the ghost inventory total has reached 451 units [P1:65, P3:54, P13:130, P17:127, P29:34, P34:41]. Genuine pipeline inventory consists of P38 (155), P40 (65), and P41 (45), totaling 265 units. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently despite the inflated pipeline, I will set mu_hat to the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the ghost inventory (451 units). Using L=2, demand forecast per period is ~90. Expected demand for 3 periods = 270. mu_hat = 270 + 451 = 721. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility observed in the peak season.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory increased to 451 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29, P34). P38 (155 units) is now 4 periods old; if it does not arrive by P43, it will be added to ghost inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the period ending 2019/11/25 (P42) surged to 159, confirming a Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is approximately 105 units. Total 'ghost inventory' (lost/severely delayed shipments) has increased to 606 units: the previous 451 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29, P34) plus P38 (ordered 155 units, now 5 periods ago with no arrival). The backend 'In-transit' counts these 606 units as valid supply, so mu_hat must be inflated to bypass this logic. To maintain stock for the upcoming December weeks (L+1 = 3 periods of demand at ~105 units/period), we need a 'true' base stock of roughly 315 units. To force the OR engine to order this despite 606 'phantom' units in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately 920. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average lead time of successful deliveries, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture current holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory increased to 606 units as P38 (155 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. November peak demand confirmed (P42 spike of 159), with the current high-demand regime averaging ~105 units/period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44, heading into the December peak season for hosiery (socks and tights). Demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) has averaged approximately 101 units/period, with a significant spike of 159 units in Period 42. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this high November-December regime. The lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will continue using the 'calculate' method to reflect the actual average performance. A critical issue remains the 'ghost inventory': 606 units are currently recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost or severely overdue (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29, P34, and now P38). To prevent the OR backend from seeing these 606 units as available supply and reducing our order, I am explicitly inflating mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory. With L=2 (avg) and mu=101, base mu_hat would be ~303. Adding 606 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 909. This forces the OR logic to place an order despite the inflated in-transit figure (860 units). Check: In-transit (860) < Base Stock (909), triggering an order.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory increased to 606 units as P38 (155 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. November-December demand regime (P39-P43) average is ~101 units/period.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in the peak December holiday season (Date: 2019/12/16). Demand has surged, with the recent 5-period average (P40-P44) at approximately 107.6 units. The product (20 denier stay-ups) is highly relevant for festive winter wear. A critical operational issue persists: total ghost inventory (lost shipments) has reached 606 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29, P34, P38). These units are recorded as 'In-transit' but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this inflated pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat by these 606 units. I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat: (L+1) * 110 units (estimated holiday mean) + 606 units (lost shipment compensation) = (3 * 110) + 606 = 936. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture current high volatility during the peak season.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand holiday season (December). Peak demand was observed in Period 45 (177 units) and Period 42 (159 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 129 units. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains a significant factor in the 'In-transit' figure. As of Period 46, total ghost inventory is 606 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29, P34, P38). To calculate the order correctly, mu_hat must be inflated to neutralize these non-arriving units. Using an average demand of 129 and a lead time of 2, the expected mu_hat would be (1+2)*129 = 387. Adding the ghost inventory offset of 606 units results in a requested mu_hat of 993. This ensures the backend produces an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' volume. Sigma_hat is set to a high recent value to account for holiday volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Peak holiday demand regime confirmed (avg ~129 units/period P41-P45). Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 606 units (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29, P34, P38).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the peak of the winter holiday season (late December). Recent demand (P42-P46) has averaged approximately 137 units per period, representing the highest regime of the year for this SKU (leggings/tights). Total 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P1, P3, P13, P17, P29, P34, P38) is confirmed at 606 units. These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' data (978 units), but only 372 units (978 minus 606) are actually in the valid pipeline (orders from P44, P45, P46). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this data discrepancy, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS an offset of 606 to neutralize the ghost inventory. Estimated demand for the current period and lead time (L=2) is ~135 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat = (1+2)*135 + 606 = 405 + 606 = 1011. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed during this peak season (~35 units/period * sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Peak holiday demand (P42-P46) confirmed at ~137 units/period. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains stable at 606 units through Period 47.
