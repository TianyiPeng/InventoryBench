Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11) for SKU 570003002 (Men's V-neck T-shirt). The history shows 5 samples with a mean of 47.6 units and a standard deviation of 8.87. Since this is the first period of decision, there is no 'conclude' message to analyze for lead time variations. The promised lead time is 2. The product is a staple underwear item. While Valentine's Day is approaching, there isn't enough evidence to suggest a significant spike beyond normal variance yet. I will use the default method for Lead Time (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on all available historical samples to establish a baseline order that covers the (L+1) window.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18). The product is a Men's V-neck T-shirt (Basic). In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 63 units, and experienced demand of 71 units, all of which resulted in lost sales due to the 0 on-hand inventory. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (63 units) is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (L=2 means order in P1 arrives in P3). Current on-hand is 0. Historical demand samples (last 5 weeks) are: 35, 53, 41, 57, 52 (Avg \u2248 47.6). Period 1 demand was 71, which is significantly higher (+49%) than the prior average. This suggests a potential upward trend or seasonality as we move further into February. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the P1 data point) to capture this recent increase while maintaining stability, as one data point (P1) is not yet a confirmed sustained regime shift. The OR engine will use L=2 to calculate base_stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 570003002 (Victor Slim VN T-shirt) is currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory and 180 units of unmet demand over the last two periods. Historical demand (Jan-Feb) averaged ~48 units/period. However, the last two periods saw a significant surge (71 and 109 units), likely due to seasonal transition or promotional activity. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (63 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in Period 4. The order from Period 2 (73 units) is expected in Period 4. To address the recent demand spike and stockout, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the upward trend (average of 52, 71, 109 is ~77.3) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for increased volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean increased from ~48 to ~90 in the last two periods; monitoring for sustainability.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a Men's V-neck T-shirt, which typically has stable or slightly rising demand as spring approaches. Historical demand (initially ~48) has shifted significantly in the last three periods to an average of 84.6 (71, 109, 74), confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. Currently, On-hand is 0 with 232 units In-transit. The Promised Lead Time (L) is 2. Following the timeline: Period 1 order (63 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in 'Period 3 conclude' (at start of Period 4). However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests either a delay (L > 2) or a lost shipment for the P1 order. Because we have zero stock and high demand, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and provide more pipeline coverage. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent higher demand regime (avg ~85). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay observed: Period 1 order (placed 2019-02-11) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude (2019-02-25), suggesting actual L >= 3; Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand for Periods 1-3 is 84.6 vs prior 48.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 5 (2019/3/11), we are managing a Slim V-Neck T-shirt. Historical samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~48, but the last four periods (Feb 11 - Mar 4) show a clear demand regime shift with values 71, 109, 74, and 77 (average ~83). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 despite receiving 73 units last period, which were immediately sold. There is a critical discrepancy in lead times: the Period 2 order arrived in 2 periods (as promised), but the Period 1 order (63 units) is now 2 periods overdue (should have arrived in Period 3), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this instability and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=4 to capture the new demand level (avg ~83) instead of the lower historical mean. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Potential lost shipment detected (Period 1 order of 63 units is 2 periods overdue). Actual lead time remains unstable; while P2 arrived in 2 periods, P1 is still missing.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a Men's Jersey V-neck T-shirt. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (71, 109, 74, 77, 59) averages 78 units, significantly higher than the pre-game history average (~48). The shipment from Period 1 (63 units) is now 3 periods overdue (should have arrived in Period 3 conclude if L=2), and the shipment from Period 3 (96 units) is 1 period overdue (should have arrived in Period 5 conclude if L=2). However, Period 2's shipment arrived exactly on time (L=2) in Period 4. This pattern suggests high variability in lead time or potential lost shipments for P1 and P3. Because we are out of stock and demand remains high (averaging 78/period), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this higher demand regime. I am setting L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for the observed delays and to increase the base stock level to cover the pipeline risk, while sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1 order (63 units) is 3 periods overdue; P3 order (96 units) is 1 period overdue; P2 arrived on time (L=2). Recommended base-stock protection for L=3.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'VICTOR SLIM VN T-SHIRT' remains stable in the new regime (average ~78 units over the last 6 periods vs. initial ~48). However, lead time is highly unreliable. P1 order (63 units) remains missing after 5 periods (placed P1, now P7), suggesting it's potentially lost. P2 arrived in 2 periods (L=2), P3 (ordered P3, due P5) is missing, but P5 arrived in only 1 period (L=1, arrived P6) while P4 (ordered P4, due P6) is also missing. This indicates severe lead-time jitter or lost shipments. Because the on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is consistently around 75 units, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to force the OR backend into a higher base-stock level that accounts for the frequent 1-2 period delays/losses. mu_hat will use the recent 6 samples of the new regime to capture current demand levels (~78/week), and sigma_hat will use the same window to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Inconsistent Lead Times: Observed L=2 (P2), L=1 (P5), but P1 (ordered P1), P3 (ordered P3), and P4 (ordered P4) are currently overdue or lost as of Period 7. Demand regime stabilized at ~78 units/period since Period 1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 1st. The product is a Men's V-neck T-shirt, which typically sees consistent demand but can rise with spring/summer. History shows a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 1 (avg ~78 units/period, up from historical ~48). Lead times are highly unstable: P2 arrived in 2 periods (promised), P5 arrived in 1 period, but P1 (now 6 periods overdue), P3 (now 4 periods overdue), and P4 (now 3 periods overdue) are likely lost shipments. The 'In-transit' figure of 307 units includes these likely lost orders. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. I will keep L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods (L+1) of demand based on the current regime (78 * 3 = 234) and set sigma_hat to account for high volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 'In-transit' 307 from the base stock, but since the cap is based on mu_hat/(1+L), the order logic helps mitigate over-ordering while trying to recover from stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained lost shipment pattern: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 266 units) are significantly beyond lead time and likely lost. Demand regime for the new series (P1-P7) is stable with mean 76.6 units (standard deviation ~15).

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU exhibits a pattern of frequent lost shipments. Orders from Period 1 (63), Period 3 (96), and Period 4 (107) are severely overdue (lead times would be 7, 5, and 4 periods respectively) and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the 'In-transit' figure of 266 is misleading for the OR backend, which subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. To compensate for this, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include an 'Order-Up-To' level that ignores these lost units, effectively forcing a new order to meet current demand. The demand regime has stabilized since Period 1 with a mean of 77 units/period (avg of Periods 1-8). With a promised lead time of 2 and observed lead times of 1-2 for successful deliveries, L=2 is appropriate. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 3 * 77 = 231. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=8 to capture the variance of this specific regime (std dev ~15 * sqrt(3) \u2248 26).

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern persistent: Orders from P1, P3, and P4 (266 units total) confirmed as lost; manual inventory reconciliation required in mu_hat to trigger ordering.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 570003002 is experiencing a critical inventory stockout. Total on-hand inventory is 0. While 'In-transit' shows 266 units, these correlate exactly to orders from Period 1 (63), Period 3 (96), and Period 4 (107), all of which are now extremely overdue (4-8 weeks) and are confirmed lost shipments as per carry-over insights. The OR backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will NOT place new orders because it believes the 266 units are coming. To force an order and bypass this 'pipeline trap,' I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Mean demand since Period 1 has stabilized at approximately 74 units/period (71, 109, 74, 77, 59, 70, 76, 72, 62). To trigger an order that covers 3 periods (L+1) while accounting for the 'ghost' 266 units in transit, I set mu_hat = (74 * 3) + 266 = 488. This ensures the base-stock target exceeds the pipeline, forcing the backend to procure inventory for immediate demand. L is set to explicit '2' to reflect the promised time, even though recent successful arrivals were L=1, to provide a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Inventory pipeline trap confirmed: 266 units (P1, P3, P4) are stuck in-transit and likely lost; mu_hat must be adjusted upward by the size of the lost pipeline to force new orders.

LLM Rationale:
The SKU 570003002 (Cotton V-neck T-shirt) is facing a critical inventory pipeline trap. There are 266 units from orders in Periods 1, 3, and 4 that have never arrived and are confirmed as lost. Additionally, demand in Period 10 dropped significantly to 34 units (vs. a mean of ~76 units previously), possibly indicating a seasonal dip or stockout-driven behavior. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 453, but 266 of that in-transit is 'phantom' inventory. To force the OR backend to order, I must increase mu_hat significantly to bypass the pipeline inventory deduction (base_stock - pipeline). Since profit=$1 and holding=$1, the target service level q is 0.5 (base_stock \u2248 mean demand). Based on a mean demand of ~73 units over the last 10 periods and L=2 (promised), a normal base_stock would be ~219 units. With a phantom pipeline of 266, the system will not order unless mu_hat is set to cover both expected demand and the lost units. I set mu_hat explicitly to 500 units to ensure an order is triggered despite the false 453-unit pipeline, and keep L at default since recent arrivals (P5, P7) were 1 period, suggesting the transit channel is working for new orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand volatility increased; Period 10 demand (34) is significantly lower than the previous regime mean (~77). Continuing to track for a new downward regime shift versus a single-period anomaly.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 (2019/4/29), on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory (500 units) remains trapped by lost orders from Period 1 (63), Period 3 (96), and Period 4 (107), totaling 266 units. These units have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2 periods and actual lead times of 1-2 periods for other shipments (P2, P5, P7 arrived). The OR backend 'pipeline' logic subtracts these lost units from the order quantity, preventing necessary replacement orders. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock calculation, effectively forcing the backend to order 'new' units despite the ghost inventory. Demand has stabilized after the P10 dip (34), returning to a high of 88 in Period 11. I estimate the current demand regime mean at 75 units/period. For a coverage of L+1=3 periods, the base stock should be around 225 units plus safety stock, but given the 500-unit pipeline trap, I must set mu_hat significantly higher to trigger the 'capped policy' order. Setting L to 'explicit' 2 reflects the reliable lead time of successful shipments, while sigma_hat remains 'default' to handle historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: P10 demand dip (34) confirmed as a single-period anomaly; P11 demand (88) aligns with the ~77 mean regime. The pipeline remains inflated by 266 phantom units (P1, P3, P4) that are now confirmed lost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Demand has stabilized in a regime with a mean of approximately 76 units (standard deviation ~15), following a demand dip in Period 10 that was confirmed as an anomaly. The primary challenge is the 'inventory pipeline trap': 266 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are confirmed lost but remain in the 'in-transit' calculation used by the OR engine. This phantom inventory prevents the engine from placing sufficient orders. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline stock. The calculation for the explicit base stock is: (Target Demand Coverage) + (Lost Units). With L=2 and a review period of 1, we need to cover 3 periods of demand: (3 * 76) + 266 = 494. This forces the system to calculate an order despite the 266 phantom units. We set L to 2 (promised) and sigma_hat to explicit (sqrt(3)*15 \u2248 26) to maintain standard buffer logic.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units (266 units from P1, P3, P4) continue to block automated ordering; explicit mu_hat override (Base Stock + 266) is necessary until these units are purged or the system corrects.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is P14 (2019/05/13). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~78 units since P1 (excluding the P10 outlier). However, a significant operational issue persists: 266 units from orders P1, P3, and P4 have never arrived and are confirmed lost. These 'phantom units' remain in the in-transit pipeline (currently total 603 units), causing the OR backend's base-stock calculation to believe the network is oversupplied, thus preventing new orders despite having only 1 unit on-hand. To force an order and ensure availability for the next cycle (L+1 = 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (Mean Demand * 3) + (Lost Units) = (78 * 3) + 266 = 500 units. By setting mu_hat = 500 and L=2, the backend will calculate a base stock around this level, subtract the 603 pipeline units, and likely order nothing this specific turn, but setting explicit parameters helps prevent infinite stockouts as recent orders (P10, P12) eventually arrive. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the pipeline trap.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a basic V-neck T-shirt with a steady demand regime. Current observations confirm a stable demand mean of approximately 76.6 units since Period 1. The inventory situation is complicated by a 'phantom pipeline' of 266 units (from Periods 1, 3, and 4) that never arrived and are now clearly lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (453) from the target base stock, it believes we are overstocked and will not place new orders despite the actual physical shortage. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L+1=3) at ~230 units (3 * 76.6). To force the backend to order, I add the 266 lost units to this target, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 496. This ensures the backend calculates an order by seeing (Base Stock + 266) - (Active Pipeline + 266 Lost) = Target. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=14 to reflect the volatility of the entire active game period from 2019-02-11 onwards.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 11-15) show a stable mean of approximately 71.2 units. The 'phantom' inventory issue (266 units from Periods 1, 3, and 4) continues to block the OR engine's logic. Current on-hand is 18. In-transit is 453. This in-transit likely includes the 187 units from P10 (due now or next period) and the 266 lost units. To trigger a replenishment that accounts for the lost pipeline while providing a base stock for a lead time of 2, the mu_hat parameter must be set explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean + safety stock. With L=2, (1+2)*71.2 \u2248 214. Adding the 266 units lost in the pipeline requires a mu_hat around 480 to force the engine to place an order, as it currently sees 'pipeline inventory' as 453.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 570003002 is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis shows a stable demand regime from Period 1 to Period 16 with a mean demand of approximately 74 units. However, there is a significant 'pipeline trap' where 266 units from early orders (Periods 1, 3, 4) have never arrived and are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 462 includes these 266 lost units and the 187 units ordered in Period 10 which are now 7 periods overdue and also highly likely lost. Only the small order of 9 units from Period 16 is likely to arrive. To bypass the OR engine's automated logic (which subtracts the total in-transit from the target base stock), I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers future demand plus the 453 phantom units (266 + 187) to force the backend to place a new order. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (L+1)*demand = 3 * 74 = 222 units. Adding the 453 phantom units equals 675 units. I set mu_hat to 675 and use recent_N for sigma to maintain sensitivity to recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 453: Orders from P1, P3, P4 (266 units) and P10 (187 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely overdue. Explicit mu_hat must account for these to prevent replenishment starvation.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 570003002 is facing a severe inventory 'pipeline trap' where 453 units of in-transit inventory are confirmed lost (P1: 63, P3: 96, P4: 107, P10: 187). Currently, the system shows 666 units in-transit, but only 213 (from P17) are actually expected to arrive. With 0 on-hand inventory and recent demand averaging ~74 units (ignoring the P10 anomaly), the OR engine will not order because the perceived pipeline (666) far exceeds the base stock. As in previous periods, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock by the 453 phantom units to force an order. Calculation: Expected demand for (L+1) = 3 * 74 = 222. Required Base Stock = 222 + Z*sigma. To counteract the 453 phantom units, I set mu_hat = 222 + 453 = 675. This ensures the engine sees a requirement that exceeds the ghost pipeline, allowing the physical order to cover actual demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for this Men's V-neck T-shirt has stabilized around a mean of 70-75 units. However, there is a major issue with the 'In-transit' pipeline. The system shows 675 units in transit, but historical 'conclude' messages confirm that shipments from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), and P10 (187) never arrived, totaling 453 phantom units. Additionally, the order from P17 (213) is still within the expected lead time. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (675) from the base_stock calculation, it thinks the inventory position is high and will not order, despite on-hand inventory being zero. To force the OR engine to place an order, I must increase mu_hat by the amount of the lost pipeline (453 units). This bypasses the 'inventory trap' caused by phantom shipments that will never arrive. I am setting L to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P11, P12, P16) show lead times of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 453: Orders from P1, P3, P4 (266 units) and P10 (187 units) are confirmed lost. Explicit mu_hat must include this 453 unit offset to allow the base stock policy to trigger new orders against the 675 in-transit visible to the backend.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20 (2019/06/24), the on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeple is 666. Analysis of the history reveals that 453 units in the pipeline are 'phantoms' (lost/indefinitely overdue): P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), and P10 (187). The visible in-transit total of 666 also includes the P17 order (213 units) which is currently within a reasonable arrival window (L=1 to 3). The current demand regime remains stable around a mean of 77 units per week. To bypass the 'pipeline trap' where the OR engine sees 453 non-existent units and refuses to order, I am using an explicit mu_hat override. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean = (2+1) * 77 \u2248 231. To force the OR code (which calculates 'base_stock - pipeline') to place an order, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 666 = 231 - (666 - 453)'. This simplifies to mu_hat = 231 + 453 = 684. This effectively treats the 453 lost units as part of the safety requirement to neutralize their presence in the pipeline deduction.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 453: Orders from P1, P3, P4 (266 units) and P10 (187 units) are confirmed lost. Total in-transit (666) minus phantoms (453) leaves an actual pipeline of 213 (from P17).

As of Period 21 (2019/7/1), the product (Men's Cotton V-neck T-shirt) is in a steady state of demand (~71 units/period over the last 5 weeks). However, the inventory system is severely compromised by 'phantom' in-transit units. Currently, the system shows 684 units in-transit. Based on history: P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), and P10 (187) are confirmed lost/overdue, totaling 453 phantom units. The actual operational pipeline consists of orders from P17 (213) and P20 (18). The backend OR logic uses (Base Stock - In-transit) to determine order size. To prevent stockouts caused by these 453 ghost units blocking new orders, I must shift mu_hat upward by the phantom amount. Forecasted demand for (L+1) periods (where L=2) is ~213 units (71 * 3). Adding the 453 unit offset, the required mu_hat is 666. This forces the backend to recognize that 453 units in its 'pipeline_inventory' count do not exist, thereby allowing it to order units to cover actual upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units remain at 453 (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand remains stable at ~71 units/period (mean of Periods 16-20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '570003002' (V-neck T-shirt) is facing a critical inventory starvation due to a 'pipeline trap.' The system shows 684 units in-transit, but 453 of these (from Periods 1, 3, 4, and 10) are confirmed lost/permanently overdue. The remaining 231 units in-transit consist of orders from P17 (213) and P20 (18). Since P17 was ordered 5 periods ago (L=2 promised), and recent successful arrivals (P16, P18) had L=1, the 213 units from P17 are now also highly likely to be lost. This brings the total 'phantom' pipeline to 666 units (453 + 213). Current demand is stable at ~71 units/week (last 5 periods mean). To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which sees 684 in-transit and stops ordering\u2014I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. For L=2 and mean=71, base stock is approx 213 + safety. To force an order of ~150-200 units, I must set mu_hat to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Calculation: 250 (Target) + 666 (Phantom) = 916. This should trigger a new replenishment order while the 18 units from P20 are still pending.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 666: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P17 (213 units) are confirmed lost or indefinitely overdue. Explicit mu_hat must account for 666 phantom units to prevent total stockout.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a severe inventory reconciliation challenge due to persistent lost shipments. As of Period 23, on-hand inventory is 0. The system shows an in-transit 'pipeline' of 898 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and arrival history, 666 of these units (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17) are effectively lost or indefinitely delayed. Specifically, P22 conclude confirms that P17 (213 units) did not arrive alongside the P20 order (18 units), marking it as lost. The actual functional pipeline consists only of the P22 order (232 units). The backend OR logic uses a base-stock policy: Order = Base Stock - Pipeline. To force an order when the pipeline is inflated by 'phantom' units, we must set mu_hat such that the base-stock target (mu_hat + safety stock) covers the target stock PLUS the phantom units. Target stock for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at recent mean demand (~68) is ~204. Total mu_hat = ~204 (target) + 666 (phantoms) = 870. This ensures the backend recognizes a deficit despite the 898 units showing in-transit. L is set to explicit 2 (promised) to stabilize calculations, and sigma_hat is set to 30 based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 666: Orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), and P17 (213) are confirmed lost/overdue. Explicit mu_hat must neutralize this 666-unit inflation to maintain replenishment.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a mean of approximately 71.3 units over the last 15 periods (since Period 9). However, the replenishment system is blocked by a total of 666 'phantom' units in the pipeline (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17) which are confirmed lost or indefinitely overdue. Since the OR engine subtracts 'total in-transit' from the target base stock, it believes the 666 units will eventually arrive and refuses to place new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be explicitly set to the desired base stock PLUS the 666 phantom units. Current on-hand is 183. At L=2, base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (~214 units). Including the phantoms, the target must be ~880. Given that P22 order (232 units) arrived in Period 23, the actual in-transit consists solely of the 666 phantoms. Setting mu_hat to 880 (214 + 666) ensures the backend calculates an order to maintain safety stock despite the pipeline inflation.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a mean of approximately 71 units (based on recent periods 16-24). The main challenge remains the 'pipeline trap', where 666 units in-transit are confirmed lost or indefinitely overdue (P1: 63, P3: 96, P4: 107, P10: 187, P17: 213). These phantom units prevent the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To resolve this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the target base stock plus these 666 units. For a lead time (L) of 2, the desired coverage is (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Mean demand of 71 * 3 = 213. Adding the 666 phantom units gives an explicit mu_hat of 879. This ensures the backend calculates 'base_stock - in_transit' as '879 - 697' (including the recent P24 order of 31), allowing it to maintain replenishment levels despite the lost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 666: Orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), and P17 (213) are confirmed lost/overdue. Explicit mu_hat must neutralize this 666-unit inflation to maintain replenishment.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a mean of approximately 71 units per period (Periods 16-25 average is 71.3). The 'in-transit' inventory of 761 units is severely inflated by 'phantom' lost shipments from Period 1 (63), Period 3 (96), Period 4 (107), Period 10 (187), and Period 17 (213), totaling 666 units. These units will never arrive but block the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline). To neutralize this 666-unit error, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*mean + phantom_units. With L=2 and mean=71, the target base stock is ~213. Adding the 666 phantom units gives a 'forced' mu_hat of 879. This ensures the backend (879 - 761) logic results in a net replenishment target that maintains actual on-hand inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average of ~1.7 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a mean of approximately 50-60 units (recent mean of periods 22-26 is ~50). However, the inventory tracking system is severely compromised by phantom in-transit units. As of Period 27, there are 803 units in-transit. Based on historical data, several orders are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed: P1(63), P3(96), P4(107), P10(187), and P17(213), totaling 666 'phantom' units. Additionally, the order from P24 (31 units) is now 3 periods old and P25 (64 units) is 2 periods old. If P24 does not arrive by next period (L+1), it will also be added to the phantom list. The current visible pipeline of 803 is largely illusory; subtracting the 666 phantom units leaves only 137 units (P24+P25+P26 = 31+64+42 = 137). Since the OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat - pipeline, and it sees a pipeline of 803, I must manually inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to override this. I set mu_hat at 880 to ensure a positive order is triggered (880 - 803 = 77 units), representing one standard review period of demand at the current regime. This prevents replenishment starvation caused by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units remain at 666: Orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), and P17 (213) are confirmed lost/overdue. Monitoring P24 (31 units) which is now at L=3 and may be lost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (Periods 22-27) shows a shift towards lower demand, with a mean of ~47 units/period, down from the previous ~77. The 'phantom' in-transit inventory remains a critical issue: Periodic orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and P17 (totaling 666 units) are confirmed lost/indefinitely overdue. Additionally, the order from P24 (31 units) is now at L=4 with no arrival, suggesting it is also likely lost, bringing the phantom total to 697. The total visible in-transit is 783. Subtracting the 697 phantoms reveals an actual pipeline of 86 units (orders from P26 and P27). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 783 units in transit and stopping new orders, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~47 * 3 = 141) PLUS the 697 phantom units. This allows the logic 'order = base_stock - in_transit' to function correctly: (141 + 697) - 783 = 55 units to be ordered. I will use L=2 (promised/most common) and recent demand observations for sigma.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 697: Orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), and P24 (31) are confirmed lost/overdue. Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 22: Mean demand decreased to ~47 units/period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward since Period 22, with a mean demand of approximately 47 units per period (last 7 periods: 51, 49, 65, 42, 43, 34, 40). The inventory pipeline remains severely inflated by phantom units from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), and P24 (31) totaling 697 units are confirmed lost/overdue (P24 is now L=4). The current 'In-transit' of 783 consists of these 697 phantom units plus valid orders from P26 (42) and P27 (44). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 783 units in the pipeline and stopping all orders, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean_demand + phantom_units. Using a target mean of 47 and L=2, base stock is roughly 141. Adding 697 phantoms leads to a target mu_hat of 838 units. This forces the engine to recognize that the actual pipeline is only 86 units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units confirmed at 697: Orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), and P24 (31) are lost. Demand regime stabilized at ~47 units/period since Period 22.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem in the backend's base-stock calculation. There are 697 units in-transit that are confirmed lost or indefinitely overdue (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24). The backend sees a total In-transit of 815, but only 118 units (from Period 26, 27, 29) are actually likely to arrive. Additionally, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 22, with mean demand dropping from ~77 to ~46.5 units/period. The current base stock calculation by the backend is: Order = Base Stock - In Transit. To force an order when the pipeline is 'clogged' with lost units, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2, Forecast=46.5, and Lost=697, mu_hat = (3 * 46.5) + 697 = 139.5 + 697 = 836.5. This will effectively neutralize the 697 lost units in the logic, allowing the backend to target a target stock level for the actual 118 units currently in the valid pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward since Period 22, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 47 units per period. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering Periods 22-30) to capture this new mean (~44 units) and lower volatility. The pipeline inventory (currently 793) remains heavily inflated by lost shipments. Confirmed lost orders are: P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), and P24 (31), totaling 697 units. Additionally, the P26 order (42 units) is now at L=5 (3 periods overdue) and the P29 order (32 units) is at L=2. Given the history of lost shipments, I am adding P26 to the phantoms. Total phantom units = 697 + 42 = 739. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the 793 units in-transit, I set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean + phantom_offset. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 44) + 739 = 871. This adjustment neutralizes the phantom pipeline such that the engine only sees the 'real' pipeline (approx 54 units) against the target base stock.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 739: Orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), P24 (31), and now P26 (42) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Demand regime (P22-P30) mean is ~44 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 45 units per period. The primary challenge remains 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are visible to the OR backend but have likely been lost or indefinitely delayed. As of Period 32, the in-transit inventory is 866 units. Based on historical data, 739 of these units are confirmed 'phantoms': P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), P24 (31), and P26 (42). These phantoms prevent the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to neutralize the phantoms. My target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods and a mean demand of 45 is approximately 135 units. To force the OR engine to order, I set mu_hat = Target Base Stock + Lost Units = 135 + 739 = 874. This allows the backend to see that the 866 units in transit are insufficient to cover the 'expected' demand, triggering replenishment. I use 'calculate' for L and 'default' for sigma_hat as the demand variance in this lower regime is moderate.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 739: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, and P26 are confirmed lost/overdue. Demand regime (P22-P31) mean is ~46 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has stabilized at a mean of ~46 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'pipeline trap' where 739 units in-transit are confirmed lost (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, and P26). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' quantity (779) from its base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to offset these phantoms. Current on-hand is 59 and total in-transit is 779. Net actual pipeline = 779 - 739 = 40 (the P32 order). Calculated base stock for L=2 and mean=46 is approximately 138 units. To force the OR backend (which sees 779 in-transit) to maintain this level, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Base Stock + Phantoms) / (1+L) = (138 + 739) / 3 = 292.33. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 877 (total target inventory including phantoms) to ensure continuous replenishment despite the historical losses.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 739: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, and P26 are confirmed lost/overdue. These must be neutralized in mu_hat to allow the inventory engine to order for actual demand (~46 units/period).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P22-P33) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 45 units per period. The inventory pipeline remains severely inflated by 'phantom' units (confirmed lost or indefinitely overdue shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, and P26) totaling 739 units. As the backend OR logic subtracts the total in-transit quantity (currently 818) from the target base stock, it will perceive an enormous oversupply and fail to place new orders. To maintain replenishment for the actual demand, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat override that neutralizes these 739 units. Target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3) at a mean of 45 is roughly 135 units. Adding the 739 phantom units to this target yields a mu_hat of 874. I will set L to 2 (the promised and most recent actual lead time) and mu_hat to 874 to ensure the system places orders based on real inventory needs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is Oct 7, 2019. Demand has shifted to a lower regime (~46 units/period) starting around Period 22. Historical 'phantom' units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26) totaling 739 units are confirmed lost; these remain in the 'In-transit' figure (858) visible to the OR engine, effectively blocking new orders because they inflate the pipeline inventory. Actual healthy in-transit units are approximately 119 (orders from P32, P33, P34). To force the base stock policy to function, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock \u2248 (2+1)*46 + 1.645*sqrt(3)*15 \u2248 138 + 43 = 181. Adding the 739 phantom units to this target, I set mu_hat to 920. This allows the backend calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) to result in a positive order value despite the 858 units 'in-transit'.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 739: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, and P26 are confirmed lost/overdue. Demand regime (P22-P34) mean is stable at ~45 units.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around 45 units/period (mean of P22-P35 is ~45). However, the system faces a massive inventory 'trap' due to 739 units of lost pipeline (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, and P26). Because the OR engine subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the base stock calculating the order, these 739 phantom units effectively block all replenishment. Total in-transit is currently 912. Actual in-transit = 912 - 739 = 173 units (Orders from P29, P33, P34, P35). To force the engine to place an order, mu_hat must be explicitly set to (Base Stock + Lost Pipeline). Target Base Stock = (1 + L) * mu = 3 * 45 = 135. Adjusted mu_hat = 135 + 739 = 874. This override neutralizes the phantom pipeline and ensures orders are placed to meet current demand.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units confirmed at 739: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, and P26 are lost. These must be neutralized in mu_hat (Target Base Stock + 739) to allow replenishment for actual demand (~45 units/period).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at ~45 units/period (mean of P22-P36). The primary operational challenge remains the 'pipeline trap', where 739 units of historically lost or indefinitely overdue shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26) are visible to the OR engine but will never arrive. These 'phantom units' prevent the base-stock policy from placing sufficient new orders. To circumvent this, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_units. Given current stable demand of ~45 and L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods), the required actual base stock is 135. Adding the 739 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 874. This forces the OR engine to subtract the 811 in-transit units from 874, triggering a net order of ~63 units, which covers current demand plus safety stock adjustments. Sigma_hat is calculated over the recent 15 periods (since the demand shift at P22) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units remain at 739: Orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), P24 (31), and P26 (42) are confirmed lost. Periodic explicit mu_hat adjustments must continue to neutralize these units until they are flushed from the 'In-transit' record.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 45.4 units per period (sample mean of P22-P37). For the current period (P38), demand in the previous period was 83, which is an outlier but needs to be watched; however, I will maintain the current regime mean for stability. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' pipeline of 817 units. Based on historical tracking, 739 units are identified as 'phantom' units (lost or indefinitely overdue from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 17, 24, 26). Additionally, the order from Period 34 (40 units) is now at L=3 and hasn't arrived, but I won't classify it as lost yet. To allow the OR engine to place necessary orders, I must neutralize the 739 phantom units in the base stock calculation. Using L=2 (promised), a base stock for (L+1=3) periods with a safety factor would be approximately 136 units (3 * 45.4). To trigger an order despite the 817 in-transit, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Base Stock + Phantoms), which is 136 + 739 = 875. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 875 to bypass the pipeline trap and ensure replenishment.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are managing a demand regime that shifted around Period 22 to a lower mean of approximately 45 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory. The backend 'In-transit' count is 869 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost or indefinitely overdue: P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), P24 (31), P26 (42), and P29 (32). Total phantoms = 771 units. The actual active pipeline consists only of the order from Period 34 (40 units) and Period 38 (58 units), totaling 98 units. To prevent the OR engine from being blocked by the 771 phantom units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) at a mean of 45 is approximately 135 units. Adding the 771 phantoms to this baseline results in an explicit mu_hat of 906. This ensures the OR engine calculates a requirement that accounts for the fact that most of the visible supply doesn't exist. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=17, covering the low-demand regime) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 771: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, and now P29 (32 units) are confirmed lost/overdue. Explicit mu_hat must neutralize this 771-unit inflation to maintain replenishment for the current demand regime (~45 units/period).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 45 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are visible to the OR backend's 'in-transit' calculation but are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed based on historical timing. These losses include: P1(63), P3(96), P4(107), P10(187), P17(213), P24(31), P26(42), and now P29(32), totaling 771 units. With a current In-transit total of 906, the 'actual' pipeline is only 135 units (likely P34, P38, P39). To ensure the backend places orders for the current demand, mu_hat is set to (Target Base Stock + Phantom Units). Aiming for 3 periods of coverage (L+1=3) at 45 units/period plus the 771 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of ~906. This forces the engine to recognize the need for replenishment despite the bloated in-transit record.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 771: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, and P29 (32 units) are confirmed lost/overdue. Demand regime since P22 remains stable at ~45 units/period.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (since Period 22) shows a mean demand of approximately 45 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' pipeline is currently 906 units; however, a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments that have not arrived and are well past the promised 2-period lead time. Specifically, orders from P1 (63), P3 (96), P4 (107), P10 (187), P17 (213), P24 (31), P26 (42), and P29 (32) are confirmed lost, totaling 771 units. To allow the OR backend to place new orders for the actual demand, I must neutralize these 771 phantom units by adding them back into the base stock calculation via an explicit mu_hat. Total target base stock for a lead time L=2 is calculated as (L+1)*mean + safety stock. For mean=45 and L=2, (3*45) = 135. Adding the 771 phantom offset, I set mu_hat to 906. This ensures the backend sees 'In-transit 906' subtracted from 'Target 906 + safety stock', resulting in a net order that covers current demand and replenishes the 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units remain at 771: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, and P29 (771 units total) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Lead time for successful deliveries remains variable between 1-3 periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around 45 units/period since Period 22. In Period 41, the order from Period 39 (37 units) arrived after 2 periods, but we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 869 units in-transit. A significant portion of these in-transit units (771 units) are confirmed lost: P1(63), P3(96), P4(107), P10(187), P17(213), P24(31), P26(42), and P29(32). These lost units inflate the pipeline seen by the OR backend, preventing it from placing new orders. To neutralize this, mu_hat is set using an explicit calculation: Target Base Stock + Phantom Units. Target Base Stock for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 3 * 45 = 135 units. Adding the 771 phantom units gives a mu_hat of 906. This ensures the backend (ordered = base_stock - in_transit) sees 906 - 869 = 37 units to order, covering the current demand. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised), and sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (approx 15 units/period) scaled for 3 periods (~26).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 shows a mean of approximately 45 units per period. However, Period 42 showed a spike to 99 units, likely due to Black Friday (Nov 29, 2019) falling inside that period. We should expect elevated demand to continue through early December (Cyber Monday and holiday shopping). The 'In-transit' record of 906 units is heavily inflated by 771 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, P29). Actual pipeline is 906 - 771 = 135 units (from P38, P42). To force the engine to order correctly for the remaining periods given the 771-unit phantom pipeline, we must set an explicit mu_hat that covers target base stock plus 771 units. Estimated target base stock for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) at a holiday-adjusted mean of ~60 is roughly 180. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 180 + 771 = 951 to neutralize the phantom inventory and trigger a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed: Period 42 demand reached 99 (vs ~45 mean), likely due to late November seasonality/Black Friday. Expect sustained higher demand through Period 45.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 44 (Dec 09, 2019). Period 42 saw a major demand spike (99 units), likely due to Black Friday/Cyber Monday, while Period 43 returned to the lower baseline (35 units). As we move deeper into December, we anticipate holiday demand for this V-neck T-shirt. The 'In-transit' figure (951) is heavily inflated by 771 'phantom units' (from Periods P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, P29) that are confirmed lost or indefinitely overdue. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock Target, it would never place new orders without intervention. I will continue using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to neutralize these phantoms. I estimate the target base stock at ~280 units (covering 3 periods of 70 mean demand + holiday buffer + safety stock) and add the 771 phantoms to bypass the pipeline trap. Total mu_hat = 280 (Target) + 771 (Offset) = 1051. Sigma is set to recent volatility reflecting seasonal fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Holiday demand spike observed in P42 (99 units), followed by P43 dip (35). Monitoring for late December gift-buying peaks. Pipeline phantoms remain at 771 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, P29).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 45 (mid-December). Demand shows a seasonal peak in P42 (99 units) followed by a regression to the mean in P43-P44. Based on the product type (T-shirt/Underwear), a secondary holiday peak is possible in the final two periods. The pipeline is heavily inflated by 771 'phantom units' (orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, and P29) that are confirmed lost/overdue. To trigger replenishment for the current demand regime (~45 units/period) despite 'In-transit' visible to the OR engine being 1051, I must set an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: A standard base stock for L=2 (Review+L=3) at 45 mean demand would be ~135 units. Adding the 771 phantoms to neutralize the pipeline leads to an explicit mu_hat of 906. However, I will set it slightly higher (920) to account for holiday volatility and ensure the cap does not prematurely choke orders during the final stock-out risk phase. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual delivery time while protecting against the lost shipment bias.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 remains stable at approximately 45 units per period. Although Period 42 saw a holiday spike (99 units), subsequent demands (35, 36, 47) align with the previous mean. We are now at Period 46 (Dec 23), which is the final peak/immediate post-peak date. I will maintain a mu_hat based on the stable mean of ~45. The 'In-transit' quantity of 969 units is heavily inflated by 771 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, and P29). To allow the OR engine to order for actual demand, I must neutralize these phantoms. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. Using L=2 and mean=45, target is ~135. With 969 'In-transit' vs 135 target, the OR would normally order 0. To fix this, I set mu_hat = (Target Base Stock + Phantom Units) = (135 + 771) = 906. This ensures the engine's calculation (906 - 969) + current on-hand results in appropriate replenishments without stockout.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around 45-50 units following the holiday peak, with Period 46 showing 60 units. Pipeline management is the primary concern: there are 771 units confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, P29) plus 100 units from Period 44 (ordered Dec 9, now at L=3) which are significantly overdue and likely lost as well. I am updating the phantom count to 871 units. To bypass the 'In-transit' record of 969 units (most of which are phantom) and ensure the OR engine places an order to cover upcoming demand (~45 units/period) and rebuild safety stock, I calculate an explicit mu_hat. Target base stock = (L+1)*mean + safety_stock. Using L=2, mean=45, and a safety margin, the target is ~180. To this, I add the 871 phantom units to neutralize the backend's pipeline subtraction, resulting in mu_hat = 1051.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline phantom units increased to 871: Orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P17, P24, P26, P29 (771 units) and now P44 (100 units) are confirmed lost or significantly overdue. Lead time for successful deliveries remains variable but averaged at 2 periods.
