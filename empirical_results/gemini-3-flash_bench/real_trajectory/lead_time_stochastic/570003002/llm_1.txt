Since we are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the promised lead time is 2 periods, I need to cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time (P2, P3). Total demand to cover = 3 periods * ~48 units/period = 144 units. To account for potential variance and avoid stockouts during the lead time, I will add a small safety buffer.

Current inventory is 0 on-hand, and since arrivals happen after the decision phase, I will face backorders/stockouts for Period 2 and likely Period 3. To maintain a target inventory that covers approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1 + safety stock), and assuming demand stabilizes around 50-60 units/week, I need a pipeline of roughly 180-200 units.

  "rationale": "Product Analysis: The SKU is a 'VICTOR SLIM VN T-SHIRT', a basic men's underwear/jersey item. These items generally have stable year-round demand but can see slight upticks in spring (late March). Demand Regime: Historical data (P1-P6) show an average demand of approximately 77 units (71, 109, 74, 77, 59, 70). The 'regime shift' noted in Carry-over insights seems to be a stabilization around a mean of 75-80, though it remains volatile. Lead Time & Pipeline: Order P1 (160) is lost. Order P2 (50) arrived in P4 (L=2). Order P5 (85) arrived in P6 (L=1). This indicates actual lead time is 1-2 periods. Current Pipeline: On-hand = 15. In-transit = 475 (P3: 110, P4: 85, P6: 120, P7: TBD). Expected arrivals (assuming L=1 or 2): P7 resolve: Order P3 (110) or P4 (85) should arrive. If P3 (110) arrives, total OH availability is 125. If L=2 holds for P3, it should have arrived in P5. Since it didn't, P3 is likely lost. Order P4 (85) should arrive in P6 or P7. P6 saw P5's order arrive early (L=1), but P4 (85) hasn't arrived. There is a high risk of lost shipments (P1 lost, P3 likely lost, P4 possibly lost). Inventory Strategy: Pipeline is nominally very high (475), but reliability is low. However, ordering more now adds excessive holding cost risk if the pipeline clears. Since the current OH (15) is very low against a mean demand of ~75, and we have 475 units coming (which is ~6 periods of cover), I will place a conservative order to bridge potential gaps while waiting for the pipeline to resolve.",

April 1 (Period 8) marks the beginning of spring, usually correlating with a steady or slightly increasing demand for basics as weather warms. b) Demand Analysis: Historical demand from 2019-02-11 to 2019-03-25 is [71, 109, 74, 77, 59, 70, 76], yielding an average of ~77 units/period. The current regime is stable around 75-80. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Lead times are highly unreliable. P1 (160 units) and P3 (110 units) are confirmed/likely lost. P2 arrived in 2 periods; P5 arrived in 1 period. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 550 total units. In-transit Breakdown: P4 (85), P6 (120), P7 (75). The extra quantity (possibly from P1/P3 drifting in or miscounted) keeps the pipeline total at 550. Given the high loss rate, safety stock must remain high. e) Final Order Logic: Target inventory for (L+1) = 3 periods at ~80 units/period = 240 units. Since 550 units are technically 'in-transit' but historical data shows a ~40-50% loss rate (270 units lost out of 525 ordered in P1-P5), the 'effective' in-transit is likely much lower (approx 200-280 units).

Evaluation of the pipeline: Total 'In-transit' is 465, but history confirms P1 (160), P3 (110), and P4 (85) are lost (total lost: 355). Actual viable in-transit is therefore 465 - 355 = 110 units (P10: 70 units, P12: 40 units). On-hand inventory is 20 units. Total viable stock (On-hand + Viable In-transit) = 130 units. Given a lead time of 2 periods, I need to cover demand for P13, P14, and P15. Forecasted demand is approximately 85 units/period. Required coverage for 3 periods = 85 * 3 = 255 units. Gap = 255 - 130 = 125 units. I will order 125 units to restore safety stock and account for the high historical shipment loss rate.",

The system-reported In-transit of 990 contains 890 units from historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P14, P17, P19, P24). Given the recent demand surge and a lead time of 1-3 periods, I need to cover the next 3 weeks (L+1 + safety). Expected demand for the next 3 periods is estimated at 180 units (accounting for the recent spike). Total functional pipeline is 100 units. To cover the remaining 80 units and rebuild a safety buffer against high fulfillment risk (~50% loss rate), a larger order is necessary.",
