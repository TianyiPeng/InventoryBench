Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 (2019-02-11). The SKU is a 'Kelly Shirt,' which is a cotton blouse. Historical demand shows a clear upward trend leading into February: 0 -> 2 -> 10 -> 16 -> 24. This suggests the product is transitioning from a low-demand phase to a higher spring-season demand phase. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a promised lead time of 2 periods, we need to order immediately to meet this rising demand. The average demand over the last 3 samples is approximately 16.7 units. For Period 1, I expect demand to follow the current trend (continuing to increase or stabilizing at the current level). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent growth rather than the long-term average, which is skewed by the zero-demand start. $L$ is set to default (2).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2 (2019-02-18). Looking at the history, the demand for the 'KELLY SHIRT' (a cotton blouse) has shown a significant upward trend over the last five weeks (0, 2, 10, 16, 24, and most recently 20 in Period 1). This suggests a transition from a low-demand winter period into early spring fashion seasonality. In Period 1, we ordered 29 units with a promised lead time of 2. This order is in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 3 (visible in P4). We currently have 0 on-hand and faced an unmet demand of 20 in Period 1 (stockout). To address the rising demand and mitigate stockouts, I will use 'recent_N' for demand estimation focusing on the last 4 periods where the trend became clear. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) factor and the upward trajectory, forecasting average weekly demand at approximately 22 units. With L=2, (1+L)=3, so mu_hat = 3 * 22 = 66. Sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand for the 'KELLY SHIRT' (airy cotton, long sleeves) has surged significantly from 0-24 in the pre-game samples to 20 in P1 and 55 in P2, likely driven by the approaching spring season and warmer weather. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales (75 units total) because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (29 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution phase, and the order from P2 (32 units) in P4. To capture the recent upward trend and avoid stockouts as seasonality kicks in, I will use recent demand history (N=2) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since no orders have concluded yet, I will stick with the promised lead time L=2 (default).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Cotton Blouse) is entering Period 4. Historical demand analysis shows a significant upward trend: P-1 (20), P-2 (55), P-3 (81). Combined with pre-game samples (0, 2, 10, 16, 24), we are seeing a clear seasonal ramp-up as we move into March (spring fashion). The current demand regime shift is sustained over 3+ periods. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (29 units) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase (to be visible now at the start of Period 4), but the conclude message for Period 3 shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the first shipment is delayed/lost. Given the 'airy cotton blouse' description, demand will likely continue to climb. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 360 (forecasting an average of 90 units/week over 1+L periods, where L=3) and L to an explicit 3 to account for the observed delay. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to reflect the steepening demand curve.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand grew from ~20 to 81 (+300%) over the last 3 periods (Feb to early March). Lead time is verified as > 2 periods (Period 1 order of 29 units not yet visible at Start of Period 4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5 (March 11). The product is a 'KELLY SHIRT', a seasonal spring item (airy cotton, long sleeves). Demand has increased sharply from 20 in Week 1 to 144 in Week 4, indicating a strong seasonal uptrend as we move into spring. The Period 4 observation showed that the Period 2 order arrived (L=2), but importantly, the Period 1 order (29 units) is missing/delayed, as it should have arrived in Period 3 or 4. This resulted in a stockout where we only sold 32 units against a demand of 144. To capture the current high-demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat based on the last three periods of demand (55, 81, 144). Since the lead time for the P2 order was 2 periods, I will stick with the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate observed data. Given the high volatility of this seasonal ramp-up, I will use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to ensure a higher safety stock to prevent further lost sales during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed: demand increased from 55 to 144 over 3 periods, suggesting a spring seasonal peak. Order from Period 1 (29 units) is confirmed lost or significantly delayed (should have arrived by P3/P4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/3/18 (early spring). The SKU 'KELLY SHIRT' is an airy cotton shirt, which is seasonally relevant for spring. Historical demand has surged significantly from low double digits in early February to a peak of 144 in early March, settling at 89 last period. The demand regime shift is confirmed. Crucially, inventory management is struggling: Period 1's order (29 units) is lost, Period 2's arrived on time in Period 4 (but was immediately sold out), and Period 3's order (79 units) is delayed (it should have arrived in Period 5). This suggests lead time reliability is poor or currently averaging 3+ periods if Period 3 arrives this period. I will set L to 3 to account for this systemic delay. For demand, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~104) while being slightly conservative versus the all-time peak of 144 to avoid massive overstock if the peak is passing.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability observed: P1 order lost; P3 order delayed (not arrived by P5 conclude). Actual lead time trending toward 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/3/25), the SKU (Kelly Shirt) is in a significant uptrend likely tied to spring seasonality. Demand in Period 6 spiked to 157. Lead time has been highly unstable: P1 (ordered P1, 29 units) is lost. P2 (32 units) took 2 periods. P3 (79 units) and P4 (141 units) are missing past their promised window (L=2), yet P5 (98 units) arrived in just 1 period. On-hand remains 0, with a pipeline of 379 units (P3, P4, P6). Excluding the lost P1 units, the realistic 'effective' pipeline is likely 350. The demand average of the last 3 periods is 130. Given the high volatility (sigma) and risk of stockouts (ending on-hand has been 0 for 6 consecutive periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-period regime to capture the current high-demand state, while using 'calculate' for Lead Time to allow the backend to incorporate the mix of L=1 and L=2 deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain volatility confirmed: Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2+ periods (P5 took 1, P2 took 2, P3/P4 delayed > 2). Period 1 order (29 units) is formally considered a lost shipment.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of April 1st (Period 8), the demand for the cotton 'KELLY SHIRT' continues a strong upward trend, which is consistent with spring seasonality. Last period's demand reached its highest point yet (184 units). We are currently out of stock (0 on-hand) due to chronic stockouts and supply chain issues. Regarding lead times: the Period 1 order is confirmed lost; Period 2 arrived in 2 periods; Period 5 arrived in 1 period; but orders from Periods 3, 4, 6, and 7 are currently in-transit. This inconsistency suggests high lead time volatility. Given the 1-period arrival (P5 to P6) and 2-period arrival (P2 to P4), lead time remains unstable but sits around 2 periods on average. To protect against the stockouts seen in Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7, I am adopting a more aggressive demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~128.5/period) and 'calculate' for lead time to let the engine account for the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak sustained: Average demand for the last 4 periods (P4-P7) reached 143.5 units (+140% vs initial weeks). High supply volatility: 57% of orders since P1 (4 out of 7) have either been lost or are significantly delayed beyond expected lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The date is 2019/4/8, transitioning into mid-spring. This SKU (airy cotton shirt) is in its peak seasonal demand regime. The demand history shows a clear upward trend: 20 -> 55 -> 81 -> 144 -> 89 -> 157 -> 184 -> 190. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is approx 153 units, with the most recent three periods (P6-P8) averaging 177 units. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this high-velocity spring peak. Regarding Lead Time: The promised L=2 is unstable. We have observed arrivals in 1 and 2 periods (P2 arrived in 2, P5 arrived in 1, P6 arrived in 2, P7 arrived in 1), but notably, P1 (29 units), P3 (79 units), and P4 (141 units) are missing and should have arrived by now. Although some orders arrive early (L=1), the unreliability of the supply chain suggests we should treat the lead time conservatively. I will keep L at default (2) but use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility in demand and supply shown in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand peak for airy cotton shirt confirmed: March/April demand is averaging ~177 units (up from ~80 in Feb). Supply chain reliability remains low: 3 of the first 4 orders are missing or significantly delayed despite recent orders (P5, P6, P7) arriving in 1-2 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 15, 2019. The product is an airy cotton shirt, which is experiencing high spring demand. Demand in the most recent 6 periods (P4-P9) has averaged approximately 150 units, significantly higher than the initial weeks. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Specifically, 4 orders (P1, P3, P4, P8) appear lost or heavily delayed, as they have not arrived despite the 2-period promised lead time. However, recent successful arrivals (P5, P6, P7) showed lead times of 1-2 periods. To protect against the high stockout risk (On-hand is 0) and the loss of inventory in the pipeline, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to represent the promised target, but use an 'explicit' mu_hat to account for the current high demand regime (avg ~150/period). I will set mu_hat to 450 (which is (1+L)*150 where L=2). Since demand volatility is high (standard deviation of recent periods is ~40), I will set sigma_hat explicitly at 70 (approx 40 * sqrt(3)) to ensure a higher safety stock and buffer against further lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain reliability remains poor: 50% of orders placed before Period 9 (P1, P3, P4, P8) are overdue or lost. Period 10 status shows 0 on-hand, creating near-certain stockouts if arrivals do not recover.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (airy cotton shirt) is in its peak spring season (April). Recent demand (Periods 7-10) has averaged 162.5 units. Period 10 conclude shows a healthy ending on-hand inventory of 149 units due to the arrival of orders from P8 and P9. However, the supply chain remains volatile: we have observed lead times of both 1 and 2 periods, while several earlier orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. To handle this, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-2 period variance. For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=4 (spanning the last month) to capture the current high-demand regime of ~162 units/period. Over the (L+1) horizon, this equates to roughly 486 units. Given on-hand (149) and in-transit (249, though some may be lost), a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat are necessary to maintain a high service level for this seasonal product.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau observed: Demand has stabilized at a high level (avg ~163 units) over the last 4 periods (P7-P10). Supply chain recovery: P8 and P9 orders arrived successfully within 1-2 periods, reducing the immediate risk of stockout seen in P9.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a 'KELLY SHIRT' (airy cotton shirt), which is entering its peak seasonal demand during the spring and early summer period. Historical demand analysis shows a clear regime shift from early February (~20-50 units) to a sustained high plateau starting in mid-March. Demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 166.8 units (184, 190, 135, 141, 184). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 381 units (P10 ordering 0, P11 ordering 132, and previously missing/delayed orders). Supply chain reliability has been inconsistent: while P8 and P9 arrived quickly (1-2 periods), many earlier orders (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost. Due to the high demand and the risk of stockouts shown in P11 (ending on-hand 0), I will target the sustained high demand regime (last 5 periods). Setting L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals have stabilized around this. I chose mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 167 units/period) to cover the L+1 period lead time risk.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand plateau confirmed: Average demand since Period 7 (late March) is 166.8 units per period, representing the established spring seasonal level for the airy cotton shirt.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (Kelly Shirt) is in a high-demand spring seasonal plateau (May 6). Average demand over the last 6 periods (P7-P12) is 175.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, with 540 units in-transit. Comparing the in-transit units to history: P11 order (132 units) and P12 order (159) are likely to arrive in the next 1-2 periods, as recent actual lead times have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9 all arrived within 1-2 periods). However, P1, P3, and P4 orders are still missing and likely lost. The OR backend needs to account for the current high-demand regime (~175/period) and the 1-2 period lead time. To mitigate the stockout risk seen in P11-P12 and handle the high volatility (sigma), I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable seasonal regime (last 6 periods). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average of observed successful deliveries (~1.6 periods).

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand plateau for Kelly Shirt confirmed: Avg demand 175.5 units (P7-P12). Lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized between 1-2 periods, despite early game losses.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Kelly Shirt (airy cotton) is in its peak spring/early summer season. Current date is May 13, and demand has stabilized at a high plateau with an average of 175 units over the last 7 periods (P7-P13). The supply chain has stabilized slightly, with recent orders (P8, P9, P11) arriving within the promised 1-2 period window, though stockouts occur due to demand outstripping supply or lumpy arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. There are 429 units in transit (P12 order of 159, P13 order of 21, and older unresolved orders). Specifically, P12 is expected to arrive during P14, making it visible at the start of P15. With demand averaging ~175, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current seasonal volume. I'll maintain L=default (2) while monitoring if P12 arrives as expected to ensure the base stock calculation properly accounts for the (L+1) exposure period (total ~525 units).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (Kelly Shirt) is in a high-demand spring seasonal phase. Demand in Period 14 reached 232 units, the highest recorded yet. The average demand over the last four periods (P11-P14) is 196.25 units, indicating that the previous plateau (~175) has shifted upward. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 395 units in-transit (P13 order of 21, P14 order of 125, plus likely lost/delayed units from P1, P3, P4). Recent successful deliveries (P11-P12) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. To capture this recent demand surge and account for the 2-period lead time (L=2, calculation window of 3 periods covers demand across L+1), I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to reflect the ~196 units/period average and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (135 to 232 range). Lead time 'L' will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed performance of 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Seasonal plateau has increased from ~175 to ~196 units avg (+12%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (KELLY SHIRT) is currently at a high-demand seasonal peak, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaging 210 units per period. The most recent demand (P15) reached 268 units, though zero inventory resulted in zero sales. Historical demand has consistently shifted upwards from ~175 to ~210 units. Supply chain lead times for completed deliveries have stabilized at 2 periods (as seen in P13 and P14 arrivals). Period 15 conclude shows 0 on-hand and an arrival of 0 units, which is expected since the P13 order was small (21 units) and P14/P15 are still in transit. With in-transit stock at 632 units (covering P13-P15 orders), we need to maintain a high base stock to account for both the L=2 lead time and the current demand surge. mu_hat is set to 630 based on recent_N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (~210/period * 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: Average demand has reached ~210 units per period (P11-P15) compared to the previous ~175 avg. Current inventory stockouts (P15) are due to demand exceeding earlier order quantities.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Kelly Shirt is currently in a high-demand early summer period (June). Recent demand has spiked significantly, with Period 15 and 16 demand reaching 268 and 270 units, well above the previous plateau of ~175 units. This represents a clear regime shift. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large in-transit pipeline (741 units), we are currently stocking out. The most recent demand average (last 4 periods: P13-P16) is 233.5 units. Lead times have mostly stabilized at 2 periods (P11 and P12 both took 2). Given the significant demand increase, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volatility and volume, and stick to the default lead time of 2. This setup targets a base stock that accounts for approximately 700 units (3 periods of ~233 demand) to bridge the wait for the large pending in-transit arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Early summer demand (late May/early June) has increased significantly to ~270 units per period, up from the previous ~196 units (+37%).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 10, 2019. The SKU is the 'Kelly Shirt' (airy cotton, long sleeves), which is clearly in its peak summer season. Demand has been highly volatile but generally increasing. In Period 17, demand was 195 units, following a peak of 270 units. Over the last 4 periods (P14-P17), demand has averaged 241 units. Although P17 saw a dip to 195, we are still in a high-demand regime relative to earlier months. Lead times have stabilized significantly compared to the early game, with the last two deliveries (P15, P16) arriving in 2 and 1 periods respectively. Period 1, 3, and 4 orders remain lost. With 151 units on hand and 427 in-transit (P13, P14, P17 orders, plus older lost ones), we must ensure we cover the lead time + review period demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the high summer demand mean and volatility, while setting Lead Time to 'calculate' to reflect the recent stabilization towards 1.5-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand (late May/June) is averaging ~240 units per period, despite a single-period dip to 195 in P17. Lead time has stabilized to 1-2 periods for recent successful shipments.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/17 (summer season for 'airy cotton shirts'). Demand has surged significantly since May (P14-P18), averaging ~229 units per period despite a dip in the most recent week (180). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 625 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P17, P18). P13 (21 units) and P14 (125 units) are now 'overdue' (5 and 4 periods since order, respectively), suggesting likely loss or severe delay given the recent 1-2 period lead time stability for P15/P16. Recent actual lead times are averaging 1.5 periods (P15 took 2, P16 took 1). I will set L to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this stabilization around 1.5-2 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the early summer demand shift, which averages 229 units per period (P14-P18). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand summer regime. This ensures the base stock (approx (1+L)*mu) targets coverage for a 3-period window (~687 units), factoring in that 146 in-transit units (P13, P14) may be lost.

Carry-over insight: Early summer demand plateau (P14-P18) confirmed at ~229 units avg. P13 and P14 orders (146 units cumulative) are likely lost as they exceed the recent stabilized 1-2 period delivery window.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. The SKU is a 'Kelly Shirt in airy cotton', representing a seasonal summer garment. Demand has recently moved from a spring plateau (~175) to a summer regime. Over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), demand has averaged 224.8 units, though single-period variability is present (highs of 270, lows of 180). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 549 units in-transit. Arrivals in the last three periods (P17-P19) show lead times of 1 or 2 periods, confirming the stabilization noted in carry-over insights. However, orders from P13 and P14 (totaling 146 units) are now clearly lost, as they are 5+ periods overdue. These lost units must be excluded from the pipeline for the OR engine to place a corrective order. By setting L to 'calculate', the engine will use the actual observed lead times (averaging ~1.6 periods). Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 targets the current summer demand average of ~225 units per period. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering L+1 periods) reflects the current seasonal peak and accounts for the missing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 13 and Period 14 (146 units) are confirmed lost (5+ periods since placement without arrival). Summer demand regime (June) is stable at an average of ~225 units per period.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1, 2019. We are moving into the peak of summer for the 'Kelly Shirt' (airy cotton, likely high demand in hot weather). Recent demand (P17-P20) shows a slight cooling or fluctuation (avg ~180 units) compared to the late May/early June peak (avg ~240). However, the zero on-hand inventory at the start of Period 21 following a demand of 135 in P20 indicates a continued stockout situation. Historical lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized at 1-2 periods (average approx 1.6 periods). We have 736 units in-transit (orders from P19, P20, and possibly residual older volumes, though P13/P14 are confirmed lost). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I am using a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=5) to capture the current summer plateau while accounting for recent variability, and 'calculate' for lead time as the system has settled since the early-game instability.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand (late June/July) for early summer garments shows high variability but stabilizes at a lower plateau (~180 units) compared to the late May peak (~270 units).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Kelly Shirt (airy cotton) is currently in a mid-to-late summer demand phase. Demand has trended downwards from May/June peaks (~240 units) to a July level of approximately 144 units (average of the last 4 periods). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and a substantial 736 units in-transit. A critical auditing of the pipeline shows that orders from Period 1, 3, 4, 13, and 14 (total 353 units) are highly likely lost as they are many periods past the promised and observed lead times. After accounting for these losses, the 'effective' in-transit inventory is approximately 383 units (orders from P19, P20, and P22). To avoid excessive holding costs as demand continues to cool into late summer, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window to capture the local demand average (~144) and maintaining a 2-period lead time estimate. The high level of in-transit relative to the current lower demand regime should naturally lead the OR engine to pause or reduce ordering.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime shift (July): Demand has stabilized at a lower plateau of ~144 units (P18-P21), decreasing from the June average of ~225 units. Lost shipment tally updated: P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 orders (353 units total) are considered lost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Kelly Shirt (airy cotton) is currently in a mid-to-late summer demand decline. Recent demand samples show a clear downward trend: Period 19 (211), Period 20 (135), Period 21 (103), and Period 22 (84). This confirms the mid-summer demand regime shift noted in Carry-over insights, coinciding with the typical lifecycle of seasonal cotton garments in July. The 4-period average (P19-P22) is approximately 133 units, but the most recent two periods suggest a floor closer to 80-100 units. Regarding the supply chain, while recent orders (P18, P20) arrived with 1-2 period lead times, many historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) are confirmed lost, totaling 353 units. These lost units represent 64% of the current 'In-transit' figure (549 units). Therefore, of the 549 in-transit, only about 196 (Order P19: 122 units, though possibly late/lost, and Order P22: 0, wait - checking history... P19 was 122, P20 was 187 arrived, P21 was 0, P22 was 0) are potentially viable. Actually, the backend 'In-transit' includes undelivered units; my records show P19 (122) and maybe P17 (32) are the only recent ones left besides the old lost ones. Since demand is dropping and we have 103 on-hand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the decline, and use 'calculate' for lead time as recent deliveries have stabilized to 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline in July confirmed: Weekly demand dropped from ~211 (mid-June) to ~84 (mid-July), establishing a late-season low-demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is July 22, 2019. Demand for the 'airy cotton shirt' (KELLY SHIRT) is in a clear end-of-season decline, dropping from a peak of ~270 (Period 16) to 50 in Period 23. The last three periods of demand (103, 84, 50) show a sustained downward regime shift as the summer season concludes. In-transit inventory is high (549 units), including orders from Period 19 (122 units) and recent orders. Although 146 units from Periods 13-14 are confirmed lost, the current pipeline plus on-hand (53) is extremely high (602 units total) relative to the new low-demand regime of ~50-80 units/period. The current pipeline covers more than 7 periods of current demand. Therefore, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average 1-2 period delivery speed of successful shipments, and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the sharp seasonal decline (avg ~79 units per period). This will result in zero or minimal new ordering while the system bleeds off excess stock to avoid high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand decline confirmed: Demand dropped from a June average of ~225 to a July average of ~79 units (-65%). Supply chain has stabilized to 1-2 periods for active shipments.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Kelly Shirt (airy cotton) has entered a late-summer low-demand regime as of July 2019. Demand has dropped significantly from a June peak of ~225 units to a July average of approximately 70 units per period (P21-P24: 103, 84, 50, 43). At the start of Period 25, we have 10 units on-hand and 549 units in-transit. These in-transit units are from previous high-demand orders that may still arrive, despite several historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) being confirmed lost. Given the sharp downward trend in demand and the massive pipeline relative to current sales rates, the priority is to stop ordering to avoid excessive holding costs on a seasonal item nearing the end of its cycle. I will set L to 'calculate' (historically 1-2 periods) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current low-demand plateau (~70 units/week). However, because the pipeline (549) already vastly exceeds the target base stock, the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in zero new orders.

Carry-over insight: Significant late-summer demand decline: Demand dropped from ~225 avg (June) to ~70 avg (July), a ~69% reduction, signaling the end of the seasonal peak for the airy cotton shirt.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'KELLY SHIRT' (airy cotton shirt) is clearly exiting its seasonal peak. We are now in Period 26 (August 5). Historical data shows demand peaked in late May/June (~225-270 units) and has plummeted throughout July, reaching a low of 34 units in Period 25. The mid-summer demand regime (July) averaged approximately 70 units, but the most recent two periods (P24, P25) show demand slowing even further to ~38 units. Consequently, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (P23-P25) to capture this 'end-of-season' baseline. Pipeline inventory is currently 549 units, which is extremely high (mostly from late orders placed during the peak that are now arriving or in-transit). With zero on-hand inventory but a Massive pipeline (549 units) against a projected demand of ~40/week, the OR backend's capped policy will correctly result in 0 new orders. I will use a calculated lead time as recent arrivals have stabilized between 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor reached: Late July/Early August demand for airy cotton shirt has stabilized at ~40 units per period, down from >200 in June. Stock levels are currently dominated by a large pipeline (549 units) relative to current low sales velocity.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Kelly Shirt (airy cotton) has entered its end-of-season phase as of mid-August. Demand has plummeted from a June peak of ~225 units to a current stabilized floor of ~35 units per period (average of the last 4 periods: 50, 43, 34, 24). The 'In-transit' pipeline currently contains 549 units (orders from P19 and likely later, given earlier losses like P13-14 are confirmed). Since the current demand is very low (~35 units) and the pipeline inventory (549 units) is already equivalent to over 15 periods of supply at the current rate, additional ordering is unnecessary and would only incur holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=4) to prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders. Lead time is kept at default as recent shipments (P18, P20) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor confirmed: August demand for the airy cotton shirt has stabilized at an average of ~38 units (P23-P26), down from the spring/summer peak.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Kelly Shirt (airy cotton shirt) has entered its end-of-season phase, with demand plummeting from a June peak of ~225 units to an August average of ~23 units (P26-P27). The product is highly seasonal and currently in a sharp decline. There are 549 units in-transit (reflecting lost shipments from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and potentially P17/P19, totaling 549 units across the history that have not arrived within a 5-period window). Given the in-transit units are essentially 'lost' and the current on-hand inventory is 0, we must maintain a low ordering profile to match the new low-demand regime of ~25 units per period. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 (covering P25-P27) to reflect the current floor and using explicit sigma_hat to account for the low volatility in this stage. L remains at default (2) as the system's logic for in-transit subtraction is already skewed by the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor updated: Mid-August demand has dropped to ~23 units per period (P26-P27), indicating the final clearance or dormancy phase of the summer seasonal cycle.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Kelly Shirt) is currently in a late-season dormancy/clearance phase. Demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 20-30 units per period following the summer peak. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 549 units, which is extremely high (equivalent to >20 periods of current demand). This massive inventory is the result of late-spring/early-summer orders that are finally flushing through the system or represent significant over-ordering during the demand drop-off. My primary objective is to stop all new ordering to allow the business to liquidate existing stock and avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit per period). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method (N=7, covering August) will align the target base stock with the current low-demand regime (~25 units/period), and since pipeline inventory (549) vastly exceeds this, the OR backend's capped policy will correctly output an order quantity of 0.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor confirmed: Late August demand (P26-P28) stable at ~24 units per period. Pipeline inventory (549 units) is significantly bloated relative to current demand velocity.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Kelly Shirt in airy cotton) is clearly in a deep end-of-season decline as of early September. Demand has dropped from a June peak of ~225 units/period to a late August average of ~28 units (P26-P29). Crucially, the system shows 549 units in-transit. These stem from Period 17 and 19 orders (32 + 122 units) which are now ~11-13 periods overdue and likely lost, plus the Period 20 order (187 units) which arrived in P22, but the most significant weight is the discrepancy in 'In-transit' accounting. Given that on-hand is 0 and demand is very low (~30/period), the existing pipeline (even if partially lost) massively exceeds the requirements for the remaining periods. Ordering more would only incur holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current low-demand floor without triggering new orders, as the pipeline inventory (549) is far above any reasonable base stock level calculated from a mean of ~28 units.

The SKU 697564010 (Kelly Shirt) is entering early September. Historical demand for this 'airy cotton shirt' peaked in late May/June (~270 units) and declined sharply through July and August (~24-39 units). However, the last two periods (P29-P30) show a slight uptick from 39 to 48 units, which could indicate a minor late-summer clearance or back-to-school interest, but it remains far below the initial seasonal highs. Current on-hand inventory is 0, but there is a massive 'In-transit' pipeline of 549 units. This pipeline is significantly bloated relative to the current low demand regime (avg ~35 units over the last 5 periods). Since the backend OR controller uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide orders, maintaining the current parameters will correctly result in 0 new orders being placed, allowing the existing pipeline to satisfy the remaining end-of-season demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture this current low-velocity stabilized state.

Carry-over insight: End-of-summer demand stabilized at a floor: Late August/Early September demand (P26-P30) is averaging ~32 units per period, a 85% reduction from the June peak. Pipeline inventory (549 units) is sufficient to cover >15 periods of current demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Airy Cotton Shirt) is in its end-of-season/dormancy phase as of mid-September. Demand has stabilized at a floor, with the last 6 periods (P26-P31) averaging approximately 28.1 units. A significant pipeline inventory of 549 units remains (likely from earlier delayed/unaccounted shipments or a large previous order), which is vastly disproportionate to current demand. With on-hand inventory at 0 and demand slowing, the massive in-transit volume (covering roughly 20 periods of current demand) means any further ordering would result in excessive holding costs. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the current low-demand floor, while the pipeline will naturally prevent the backend from placing new orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand floor for Airy Cotton Shirt maintained through mid-September: P26-P31 average is 28 units/period, down from summer peak of >220. Pipeline inventory (549 units) dominates supply position.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Airy Cotton Shirt) is clearly in its end-of-season/dormancy phase as of late September. Demand has plummeted from a June peak of ~225 units to a stabilized floor of approximately 27 units per period over the last 7 periods (P26-P32). The current supply position is dominated by a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 549 units. While this pipeline is largely composed of likely lost orders from the early/mid-season (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14 totaling 353 units), the remaining 196 units (from P19 onwards) still significantly exceed the demand forecast for the remainder of the season. At a current demand rate of ~27/period, even ignoring potential lost shipments, the pipeline covers over 20 periods. Therefore, the priority is to avoid any further ordering to minimize holding costs. Setting L to the promised 2 periods and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=7) will result in a base stock level far below the existing pipeline, correctly triggering zero new orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The Kelly Shirt (airy cotton) is in its end-of-season/dormancy phase as of late September (Period 34). Demand has reached a very low floor, averaging ~10 units per period over the last 3 weeks (P31-P33), significantly down from the peak summer demand. Current inventory status shows 0 on-hand but a massive in-transit pipeline of 549 units (orders from P17, P19, or potentially P32/P33 if backend automation occurred, though our log shows 0 ordered recently). Given the pipeline is >50x the current weekly demand, any further ordering must be halted. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the low-demand floor (~20-25 units/period including lead time), which will ensure the base stock calculation remains low and prevents new orders from being triggered by the OR backend. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed 1-2 period delivery window.

Carry-over insight: End-of-season demand floor matured: September demand (P31-P33) has dropped further to an average of ~10 units per period, down from the August floor of ~30. The product is now in a dormancy phase.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Airy Cotton Shirt) is clearly in a deep end-of-season dormancy phase as of early October. Demand has fallen from its June peak of over 200 units/period to a consistent floor of approximately 9 units/period over the last four periods (P31-P34). The current 'In-transit' pipeline of 549 units (representing delayed or lost orders from earlier in the season that the OR backend still tracks) is vastly disproportionate to this demand. Even if only a fraction of that pipeline arrives, it would cover months of current demand. My objective is to prevent any further ordering. I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent dormancy level (~9.5 units/period), and setting sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the low volatility of this floor. If the OR engine attempts to order, the pipeline inventory will negate the need for a restock.

Carry-over insight: Dormancy phase confirmed: October demand (P31-P34) has stabilized at ~10 units per period. Pipeline inventory (549 units) remains extremely excessive (~57x coverage).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU (Airy Cotton Shirt) is now deep in its dormancy phase (October). Demand has consistently stabilized at approximately 7-10 units per period over the last five weeks (P31-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 0, but there is a massive in-transit pipeline of 549 units stemming from unresolved historical orders. Even if only a fraction of this pipeline arrives, it will vastly exceed the current demand velocity (coverage > 50 periods). Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from generating orders, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the dormancy regime (~8.4 avg demand), and maintaining L at recent levels. Since pipeline > base_stock, the capped policy will result in an order of 0.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 697564010 (Kelly Shirt) is in a clear dormancy phase as of late October (Period 37). Demand has dropped significantly from the early summer peak (>200 units/period) to a stabilized low average of approximately 7 units per period over the last 4 weeks (P33-P36). The current inventory position shows 0 units on-hand but a massive pipeline of 549 units in-transit. These in-transit units strictly represent stalled or lost shipments from peak periods (specifically the orders placed in Periods 15, 17, and 19 totalling 549 units, which are now 18-22 periods overdue). Given that the current inventory position (pipeline) already covers over 75 periods of current demand and the product is at the end of its seasonal cycle, no further orders are required. The parameters are set to reflect this dormancy: mu_hat uses the recent_N average (N=4) to capture the current ~7 units/period velocity, and sigma_hat is minimized to prevent unnecessary safety stock triggers. The lead time is kept at default.

Carry-over insight: Dormancy phase intensified: October demand (P33-P36) further declined to an average of 7.75 units per period. Large pipeline (549 units) consists entirely of significantly overdue/lost shipments from June/July.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Airy Cotton Shirt) is now deep in its end-of-season dormancy phase as of late October. Demand has dropped from a summer high of >200 units to a negligible average of ~6-7 units per period over the last 3 weeks. There is a massive pipeline inventory of 549 units, which consists entirely of shipments that are now significantly overdue or effectively lost (orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19, and P20). Due to the extremely low demand velocity and the potential for any subset of these overdue 'lost' units to arrive and incur heavy holding costs ($1/unit/period vs $4 profit), the optimal strategy is to maintain a zero-order policy. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current dormancy regime (~7 units) to ensure the base stock calculation remains below the existing pipeline level, preventing any new orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Airy Cotton Shirt) is in its deep dormancy phase as of early November. Demand has been consistently low, averaging approximately 6.5 units per period over the last 5 weeks (P34-P38). There is a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 549 units, but as noted in the Carry-over Insights, these are largely confirmed lost or significantly overdue shipments from the June/July summer peak that have never arrived. Current on-hand inventory is 0. However, given the current demand is extremely low and the season has ended, the priority is to avoid ordering any new stock that would incur holding costs for the remainder of the year. I will set mu_hat to capture the current low-demand floor (N=5 for P34-P38) and maintain lead time at the default promised value, as no new orders are intended. Even if the 'missing' pipeline arrives, it would vastly exceed any possible remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Dormancy phase baseline: Late October/Early November demand (P34-P38) has stabilized at a floor of ~6.5 units per period. The 549 units in-transit are confirmed long-term losses/delays from the summer peak.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep dormancy phase as of November 11th. Demand has stabilized at a very low floor, with the last 6 periods (P34-P39) averaging approximately 7 units per period (7, 6, 6, 6, 8). The total 'In-transit' quantity of 549 units is comprised of historical orders (specifically P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) that have long exceeded their expected lead times and are effectively lost or permanently delayed. However, the OR backend's capped policy calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) uses the 'In-transit' value. If I use 'default' or standard 'recent_N' calculations, the backend will see 549 in transit against a demand forecast of ~7 units, resulting in zero orders\u2014which is the desired behavior for a dormant seasonal product. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the current low-demand regime, ensuring no new capital is committed to this SKU.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep dormancy phase as of mid-November. Demand has stabilized at a floor of approximately 6-8 units per period (P34-P40). The 549 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from the summer peak (P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P15, P16, P19), as they are now 20-40 periods overdue. Despite the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard, zero physical arrivals have occurred for 18 periods (since P22). Therefore, I must use an explicit L to signal that we do not expect current pipeline arrivals to satisfy demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P34-P40) to reflect the current winter dormancy baseline. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will calculate a base stock sufficient for the dormancy level, but the 'In-transit' bloat will prevent new orders from being placed unless the backend recognizes that pipeline does not cover demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to lock in the low-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Dormancy floor confirmed for November: Demand for Airy Cotton Shirt (697564010) is stable at ~7.5 units per period (P34-P40). All 549 in-transit units are confirmed lost/permanent delays from the summer season.

The Kelly Shirt (airy cotton) is in its off-season dormancy phase during late November. Current demand is extremely low, averaging 7.2 units over the last 5 periods (P37-P41). All 549 in-transit units are from orders placed between Periods 1 and 19 (early summer peak and prior) and are confirmed lost or effectively permanent delays. There is no reason to restock this item given the seasonality. I will set parameters to reflect the current low-demand floor (approx 7.5 units/period) while acknowledging the high pipeline (549 units), which will prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L)*7.5, which is far below the existing 549 pipeline units, resulting in an order quantity of 0.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Kelly Shirt) is currently in a deep dormancy phase as of December 2nd. Demand has stabilized at a very low floor, with the last 9 periods (P34-P42) averaging approximately 7 units per period. Historically, this product saw a significant peak in June (>220 units) but has since declined. The 'In-transit' quantity of 549 units consists of several shipments from early to mid-summer (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19) that are now months overdue and must be considered permanently lost. To prevent the OR backend from factoring these ghost units into its ordering logic (which would suppress necessary new orders if demand returned), the parameters are set to ignore the pipeline. However, since current demand is minimal and the product is likely out of season, I am setting mu_hat to capture the current dormancy regime (recent_N with N=9) to cover the 3-period lead time window (L+1). L is set to 'default' (2 periods) as recent successful deliveries followed that window, and sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility of this floor phase. No new orders are expected or desired given the current low sales velocity.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'Airy Cotton Shirt' (697564010) is in a dormancy phase as of December (Period 44). Demand has consistently hovered between 6 and 8 units per period throughout November and early December. The last 10 periods show an average demand of 7.2 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 549 units consists entirely of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from the summer peak (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, etc.), and since they have not arrived for over 20 periods, they will never fulfill current demand. However, the OR backend's 'cap' logic and base stock calculation will be influenced by this pipeline inventory. To ensure the system can actually place new orders if needed (though existing on-hand is 0), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to reflect the current low-velocity regime (N=10). Because the 549 units effectively block the OR engine from ordering due to the 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction (final order = base_stock - pipeline), and we know these units are lost, the only way to trigger an order would be to set mu_hat to an extremely high 'explicit' value, but since demand is only ~7 units and the end of the game is near (P47), placing large orders now would only result in high holding costs or units arriving after the game ends. Therefore, I will maintain parameters aligned with the current low demand regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product (Kelly Shirt) is in a deep dormancy phase as of December 16, 2019. Demand has consistently stayed at very low levels (averaging ~6 units per period over the last 5 weeks). The in-transit inventory of 549 units is confirmed to be composed of lost orders from the spring/summer peak (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P7, P13, P14, P17, and P19 were either lost or significantly delayed and never arrived). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and the OR backend subtracts the pipeline (549 units) from the calculated base stock, it will not place any new orders. This is appropriate given that current demand is negligible and the 'pipeline' is non-recoverable. No parameters need to be adjusted to prevent ordering, as the large (ghost) pipeline already effectively caps any replenishment. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and sigma to reflect this late-year low-volume regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is in a deep winter dormancy phase as of late December. Recent demand (P41-P45) has averaged approximately 5.0 units per period, a slight decline from the late autumn levels of ~7 units. The 549 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from the high-demand summer peak (Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19). Because 'In-transit' counts against the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of these 'ghost' units will prevent the system from ordering new stock even if demand returns. However, with current demand at a seasonal floor and on-hand inventory at 0, no new orders are desired to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit/period vs $4 profit) on a product with extremely low velocity. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised) to prevent the backend from inflating the base stock based on historical delays. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current dormancy mean (~5 units), which results in a mu_hat of ~15 (3 * 5). Sigma_hat will use the last 5 samples to reflect current low volatility.

Carry-over insight: Mid-winter dormancy confirmed: December demand (P43-P45) has fallen to an average of 4.3 units per period, down from the November average of ~7 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '697564010' (Kelly Shirt) is in a deep winter dormancy phase as of December 30, 2019. Demand has consistently declined from its June peak (>200 units) to a current floor of approximately 4 units per period (average of P43-P46 is 3.5 units). On-hand inventory is 0. However, there is a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 549 units. Following the carry-over insights, these units represent cumulative orders from early in the game (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19) that are effectively lost shipments. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to calculate orders (final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the presence of these 549 lost units will prevent the system from placing any new orders even if demand increases, as the pipeline exceeds any reasonable base stock for this demand level. While demand is currently minimal (~4 units), I must set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the true winter floor and avoid unnecessary holding costs, but the primary constraint is the ghost pipeline. No new orders are expected or needed given the current dormancy.
