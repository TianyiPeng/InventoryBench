  "rationale": "For Period 1 (2019-02-11), we are managing SKU 689389004 (Denise Shirt), a soft viscose blouse. Historical data shows demand increasing: 60, 56, 82, 71, and most recently 107 (Feb 4). The average demand over these 5 weeks is approx 75 units, but the trend is upward as we approach the spring season (Feb is a pre-spring retail period where light apparel starts to gain traction). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the L+1 logic (Lead Time + 1 for current period demand), I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Given the recent spike to 107 and the seasonal trend, I will forecast an average of 90-100 units per week. Target inventory for 3 weeks = ~300 units. Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will place an order for 300 units to establish a pipeline that meets demand starting in Period 3 (assuming lead time 2).",

(b) Demand Analysis: Historical samples (60, 56, 82, 71, 107) and the recent Period 1 demand of 86 show a rising trend as spring approaches. Mean demand over the last 6 points is ~77, but the move from ~60 in Jan to 80-100+ in Feb indicates a growth regime. (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The 300 units ordered in P1 are expected to arrive in P3 (P1 decision -> arrives during P3 resolution -> visible P4). I currently have 0 on-hand. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: I am currently stocked out (Ending inventory P1 = 0, sold 0). Total units needed to cover demand for P2, P3, and P4 (until the next possible order arrives) at an estimated 95 units/period is ~285. (e) Final Order Logic: I have 300 in-transit arriving in P3. This covers the next 3 periods of expected demand. However, I have missed 86 units of demand in P1 and will likely miss demand in P2. To ensure I don't stock out again in P5 (following the P2 order's arrival), I will order a small amount to maintain a buffer, accounting for the growth trend.",

Current Period 3 demand is estimated to be around 130-160 units based on current momentum. On-hand is 0, but the 300 arriving units will cover P3 demand. However, with demand trending upward (possibly due to spring fashion cycles), I need more inventory to cover P4 and P5. Total inventory coverage needed (L+1 = 3 periods) is roughly 450-500 units.

Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 520 units in-transit. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on 'conclude' messages: P1 order (300 units) should arrive in P3 resolution but P3 conclude shows arrived=0; however, based on the timeline rules, a lead time of 2 for an order placed in P1 means it arrives during P3 and its arrival is only visible at the start of P5. Therefore, no orders are technically overdue yet. I expect the P1 order (300 units) to arrive in the next period (P4 conclude, visible at P5 start). Current demand is averaging roughly 100-110 units per week. Target pipeline (L+1 = 3 weeks) should be around 330-400 units. Since 520 are already in-transit and I have 0 on-hand, I am already over-buffered for the immediate future once these shipments land. I will place a small order to maintain flow and account for potential lost shipments or sustained high demand, but I must avoid overstocking due to the $1.0 holding cost which equals the profit margin (1:1 ratio), making overstocking extremely punitive.",

As of Period 5 (March 11), we are entering the spring season where light blouses typically see steady or increasing demand. Inventory status: We have 38 units on-hand.

The current In-transit balance of 860 consists of: P10 (150), P11 (150), P12 (120), and the legacy lost orders (440). Therefore, only (150+150+120) = 420 units are actually likely to arrive.

At an L+1 horizon (3 periods) and an estimated upper-end demand of ~100-120 units/period (accounting for spring seasonality), I need ~360 units of coverage.

I anticipate demand will continue to rise as the transition to fall fashion begins, typical for long-sleeved tops. Regarding logistics: The 'In-transit' figure of 830 units is largely comprised of historical lost shipments (P1: 300, P3: 120, P4: 20, P10: 150, P13: 120 = 710 lost units). The effective pipeline consists only of the orders from P26 (60 units) and P27 (60 units). On-hand inventory is critically low (15 units), which is insufficient to cover the current period's demand (expected ~50-65). We are facing a stockout in Period 28 because the P26 order (expected arrival L=2) will not arrive until the resolution phase of Period 28 and thus cannot be sold until Period 29.

Based on the 2018 historical data for early February (demand 86, 151), the autumn peak for this category is likely to reach or exceed ~100 units/period.

Historical demand from the same time in previous periods and recent trends (P37-P40: 32, 23, 14, 9) show a significant seasonal decline as winter approaches. Current on-hand inventory is 233 units, which provides over 20 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate (~10 units/period). The 'In-transit' figure of 1010 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments (950 units confirmed lost from P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P26, and P29). Even accounting for these losses, the 60 units remaining in valid in-transit status plus the 233 on-hand are far more than sufficient to cover the remaining 7 periods of the game. No further orders are required, and the focus is now on minimizing further holding costs.",

  "rationale": "The SKU '689389004' is a long-sleeved shirt entering the late winter season (late November). Historical data and recent trends show a significant decline in demand for this item as it moves into the year-end low-volume regime. Average demand over the last three periods (P39-P41) is approximately 11.6 units per period, down from the autumn peak of 60+. On-hand inventory is currently 221 units, which provides over 18 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.00 each) and there are only 5-6 periods remaining (game ends Period 47), the primary objective is to minimize holding costs by liquidating existing stock rather than ordering more. The in-transit inventory of 1010 units is almost entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (950 units identified in carry-over insights), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is negligible, but this is irrelevant as the on-hand inventory is already excessive for the remaining horizon.",

Historical data and calendar context indicate that the peak seasons for this item are spring (March-April) and autumn (September), with demand dropping significantly in winter. Current period 43 (Dec 2) marks the start of the winter low-volume regime. Recent weekly demand from P39 to P42 has been 14, 9, 12, and 13 units, establishing a clear low-volume regime averaging ~12 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 208 units provides approximately 17 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate, which is excessive given the holding cost of $1.0/unit. The in-transit pipeline officially shows 1010 units, but based on carry-over insights, 950 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P13, P26, P29). Subtracting these lost units, the effective in-transit quantity is 60 units (likely from P34). Even without those 60 units, the existing 208 units on hand are more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods of the game (ending at P47). Therefore, no further units should be ordered to minimize holding costs.",
