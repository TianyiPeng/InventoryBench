Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (60, 56, 82, 71, 107) and the actual demand in Period 1 (86) show a mean demand of approximately 77 units.

Total expected demand for 3 periods (~231 units). Current pipeline is 109. If I order 108 now (total pipeline 217), I will be slightly under-stocked if demand remains around the recent peak of 107 or if Period 1's missed sales (86 units lost due to 0 inventory) create some latent demand. However, given high holding costs ($1) relative to profit ($1), the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting a lean inventory strategy.

Based on the 2-period lead time, the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P4 start). No conclusions on actual vs. promised LT can be made yet.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (60, 56, 82, 71, 107) averaged 75.2. However, observed demand in P1 (86) and P2 (151) shows a significant upward trend. The P2 demand of 151 is a major spike, possibly related to the 'Spring/Summer' season for a viscose blouse or a regime shift. The OR baseline is likely underestimating this surge because it uses all historical samples equally.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Pipeline is 217 (P1: 109, P2: 108). Total target stock needs to cover L+1 (3) periods. At the new elevated demand level (approx 120-150), we need ~360-450 units in the pipeline.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 46 units is too conservative given the P2 demand of 151 and the fact that we are currently stocked out (Sold=0).

I should have seen its arrival in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Since the message says 'arrived=0', the order is either delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. \n2. **Inventory Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P1: 86, P2: 151, P3: 78) has resulted in lost sales because no inventory has arrived yet. Total in-transit is 327 units (Orders from P1, P2, and P3). \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical samples averaged ~75. Period 2 saw a spike to 151. Given the product is a 'soft viscose shirt' and we are moving into March (Spring), demand is likely to remain steady or increase. \n4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 0 units because the pipeline (327) far exceeds its calculated base-stock level (approx 280-300 units). \n5. **Adjustment**: Although the pipeline is technically full, nothing has arrived yet. However, placing *more* orders when the first three are already late/in-transit increases holding cost risk once they finally arrive.

Interestingly, the Period 1 order (109 units) has not yet been recorded as arrived. Since P1's order was due in P3, and P4 shows no arrival for it, there is a strong possibility that order 1 is delayed or lost. \n2. Inventory & Demand: Current on-hand is 46 units. Pipeline is 219 units (consisting of the missing P1 order of 109 and the P3 order of 110). Historical demand (including pre-game samples) averages around 82 units per week. Recent demand in the game (P1-P4) averages 94 units. \n3. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the pipeline (219) + on-hand (46) as more than enough to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand. However, if the Period 1 order (109 units) is indeed lost, my effective pipeline is only 110 units. With current on-hand of 46, I have 156 units to cover lead time. At an average demand of ~85-90, I need roughly 270 units to safely cover 3 periods.

Analysis of history confirms that orders from P1 (109), P3 (110), and P10 (20) are lost (total 239 units). The active pipeline consists of orders from P13 (80 units) and P14 (35 units), totaling 115 units. Since P13 was placed 5 periods ago and P14 was placed 4 periods ago, these are significantly overdue and also likely lost, or at best, highly unreliable.\n2. Demand Analysis: Demand has shifted from ~85 units/period to ~40 units/period (average over last 5 periods: 27). The product is a 'viscose shirt/blouse', which usually experiences higher demand in spring/early summer. The drop in May/June suggests either a stockout-induced demand suppression (though on-hand was positive) or a genuine seasonal decline as the 'Divided' collection shifts to new arrivals.\n3. Inventory & OR Review: On-hand is 14. Even with the conservative 27 units average demand, we are at risk of stockout. OR recommends 0 because it sees 354 units in pipeline. However, as established, that pipeline is ghost inventory comprised of lost shipments. \n4. Strategy: I must ignore the OR recommendation. To cover 3 periods of demand (L+1) at a rate of 30 units/period, I need ~90-100 units in 'true' inventory. Current true inventory (on-hand + realistic pipeline) is 14 + 0 = 14.

Carry-over insights and history show that orders from P1, P3, P10, P13, and P14 (totaling 354 units) have not arrived despite 4-18 weeks passing; these must be considered lost. The 'In-transit' of 429 units includes these 354 lost units plus the 75 units ordered last period (P18). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 75 units.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift was identified at P13, with demand dropping from an average of ~85 to ~40. Recent data from P15-P18 (25, 17, 27, 11) suggests a further decline, averaging only 20 units/period. The SKU is a 'soft viscose shirt', likely a transitional spring/summer item. Given we are in mid-June (P19), demand is likely stabilizing or slightly declining further.\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is critical at 3 units. With an effective pipeline of 75 units (ETA P20), the total inventory to cover demand until P21 (L+1 periods) is 78 units. \n4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it treats the entire 429 in-transit units as valid, resulting in an 'inventory + pipeline' that far exceeds the base stock. By adjusting for the 354 lost units, the OR base stock logic would actually suggest ordering. \n5. **Quantity Calculation**: To cover the next 3 periods (P19, P20, P21) at a projected demand of 25 units/period (total 75), we currently have 78 units (3 on-hand + 75 expected). While this looks balanced, the high risk of shipment loss requires a small safety order to maintain stock if the P18 order (75 units) also fails or if demand slightly exceeds the recent low average.",

Subtracting the lost units identified in previous carry-over insights (109+110+20+80+35 = 354 units) leaves an effective pipeline of 40 units (the order placed in P19).

The 2019/6/24 date suggests we are in the summer season for this 'viscose weave shirt'. Demand remains low but consistent.\n4. **Inventory Strategy**: Current on-hand is 59 units.

The current in-transit inventory (514 units) includes these ghost units (109+110+20+80+35+40 = 394 units) and the P18 order (75 units) which already arrived in P19. The actual viable pipeline consists only of orders from P23 (75 units) and P24 (45 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P22-P24) has averaged ~40 units/period, while the overall average since the regime shift in P13 is approximately 30 units. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~40 units, I need 120 units available. The reliable pipeline is 120 units (75+45).

Historical demand analysis shows a recent regime of approximately 65-70 units per period (P29-P34 average is 60.5, but recent peak demand reached 87). The current in-transit amount of 664 units is highly misleading. Based on the Carry-over Insights and Game History, the following units are confirmed or highly likely lost: P1(109), P3(110), P10(20), P13(80), P14(35), P19(40), P24(45). Total lost = 439 units. Total in-transit (664) - Lost (439) = 225 units remaining in the 'real' pipeline (orders from P26, P29, P32, P33, P34). Current on-hand is 0. With a realized lead time of 1-2 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 35, 36, and 37. Expected demand for 3 periods is ~200 units. While the 225 units in the pipeline theoretically cover this, the chronic unreliability and the fact that we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory require an immediate buffer to break the stockout cycle.

{
  "rationale": "The SKU 689389004 currently has 120 units on-hand with a significant reported in-transit quantity of 599 units. However, consistent with historical patterns noted in Carry-over Insights, a large portion of this pipeline is likely lost. Specifically, orders from Period 1 through Period 34 (totaling 574 units) are considered lost as they have exceeded the observed lead time of 1-3 periods by a wide margin. The effective pipeline consists only of the Period 38 order (25 units), which is now 5 periods old and also potentially lost. Despite the pipeline unreliability, current inventory is high relative to the recent demand regime. Over the last 4 periods (P39-P42), demand has dropped significantly, averaging approximately 12 units per period (14, 9, 12, 13). With 120 units on-hand, we have roughly 10 periods of cover at current sales rates. The OR recommendation is 0, which aligns with the need to burn through existing stock given the $1/unit holding cost and the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 47). No further orders are required to meet expected demand through the remaining periods.",

{
  "rationale": "The SKU 689389004 is a soft blouse, and we are currently in Period 44 (December 9). Recent demand history (P39-P43) shows a significant decline, averaging around 13 units per period, down from the previous regime of ~30-40. This is likely due to seasonality (winter months favoring heavier garments over light viscose blouses). My current on-hand inventory is 103 units, which provides approximately 8 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Although the reported 'In-transit' pipeline is 599 units, the vast majority (574 units) are confirmed lost according to historical tracking and carry-over insights. The effective pipeline only includes the P38 order (25 units), which is 6 periods old and likely also lost. However, even with an effective pipeline of 0, the current on-hand inventory of 103 units is far more than enough to cover the remaining 3 periods of the simulation (total demand expected < 50 units). The OR recommendation is 0, which correctly reflects the high current inventory relative to low demand.",

The reported pipeline of 599 units is entirely composed of lost orders from periods 1 through 38, as established in the carry-over insights; therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. However, even with an effective pipeline of 0, the current on-hand stock is more than sufficient to cover demand through the end of the game (Period 47).
