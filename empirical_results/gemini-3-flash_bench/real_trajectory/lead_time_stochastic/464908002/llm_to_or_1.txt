Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019/2/11). The product is a 3-pack of women's thong briefs ('Underwear'). Initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Historical demand from Jan 7 to Feb 4 shows a clear downward trend (83, 59, 64, 50, 36). The average demand over these 5 weeks is 58.4 units. The most recent sample (Feb 4) is 36, significantly lower than the starting point. Given the post-holiday/early-year cooling period and the recent downward trend, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean and volatility, rather than the full historical average. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2 (2019/2/18) for SKU 464908002 (Womens Thong 3pk). The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, 87 units were ordered and 32 units of demand occurred, but since on-hand was 0, zero units were sold. The 87 units ordered in P1 are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (P1 + 2 = P3), appearing in the 'Period 3 conclude' message which I will see at the start of Period 4. Demand data for the last 5 weeks: 83, 59, 64, 50, 36. Demand in Period 1 (historically 2019/02/11) was 32. There is a clear downward trend from early January (83) to mid-February (32). I will use recent_N=3 for the demand forecast to capture this lower volume (mean of 50, 36, 32 = 39.33) rather than the 'default' which would include the high early-Jan values. Parameters L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat will be set to ensure we cover demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 3 periods).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0, with 132 units in transit (87 ordered in P1, 45 ordered in P2). Demand for the first two periods was 32 and 40, which is relatively consistent with the pre-game samples (avg ~58). Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of the current period (P3). We will not see this arrival confirmed until the Period 3 conclude message at the start of Period 4. Therefore, there are no overdue shipments yet. The product is Women's Lingerie (3pk Thong), which typically shows stable demand but could see a post-Valentine's dip. Historical samples show a slight downward trend (83 -> 36). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (including historical data + game history) to capture the trend while maintaining enough buffer for the lead time (L+1=3).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is women's thong underwear. Current date is March 4, 2019. Historical demand shows a declining trend from Jan (83, 59, 64, 50) into Feb (36). Observed demand in the last three periods (32, 40, 42) reflects a stabilization around 38 units per period. We are currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a significant backordered pipeline (152 units). Promised lead time is 2 periods. The Period 1 order (87 units) was placed on Feb 11 and is expected to arrive during Period 3 or 4. Per the 'conclude' message logic, an arrival during Period 3 would be visible at the start of Period 4. Since Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0', the shipment is either delayed or precisely following the 2-period lead time (arriving during Period 4, visible in Period 5). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand estimation to capture the recent stable regime (approx 38 units) rather than the higher January levels. For lead time, I will stick to 'default' as we haven't confirmed a deviation yet.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is March 11, 2019. The product is women's underwear (thongs), which usually has stable demand but can be influenced by stockouts. Looking at history, demand has been relatively consistent: 32, 40, 42, 40 (Avg: 38.5) despite early stockouts in Periods 1-3. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). However, the Period 1 order (87 units) is significantly overdue (it should have arrived in Period 3). Since it wasn't listed as arrived in the Period 4 conclusion, I suspect it may be a lost shipment. Total in-transit is currently 107 (likely P1: 87 + P3: 20). If P1 is lost, actual pipeline inventory is only 20. To prevent future stockouts while accounting for the missing P1 shipment, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the steady demand of ~40 units. I will set L to 'default' as the one successful arrival (P2) arrived in 2 periods. Mu_hat will target (1+L)*40 = 120 units to cover the risk of the missing P1 order not arriving.

Carry-over insight: Potential shipment loss: Period 1 order (87 units) has not arrived as of Period 4 conclude (expected Period 3). Sustained demand observed around 40 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze SKU 464908002. Context: The Period 1 order (87 units) is now 3 periods overdue (expected P3, currently P6 start). It is highly likely lost. The Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2). The Period 3 order (20 units) was placed with L=2 and should have arrived in P5 (visible in P5 conclude), but P5 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests either a lead time drift to L=3+ or another lost shipment. Inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts. Demand History: Recent samples are [32, 40, 42, 40, 24]. Excluding the latest drop (likely due to stockout or random variance), the mean is approx 35-40. To account for the likely loss of the 87 units from P1 and the delay of the 20 units from P3, I will set 'L' to an explicit 3 to buffer the pipeline. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime (approx 35.6/week). Sigma_hat will use recent_N to reflect actual volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed shipment loss/delay. Period 1 order (87 units) is 3+ periods overdue and considered lost. Period 3 order (20 units) is 1 period overdue. Lead time shows instability (one on-time, two delayed/lost).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 7 (2019/03/25), the inventory situation for SKU 464908002 remains critical with zero on-hand inventory. The lead time is unstable: Period 2's order arrived in 2 periods, Period 5's order arrived in 1 period, while Period 1 (87 units) and Period 3 (20 units) orders are significantly overdue and likely lost or severely delayed. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged 32.33 units, which is a slight drop from the initial 40+ levels but remains significant given the stockouts. To recover, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to account for the observed delivery instability and to force a larger pipeline. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (approx 32 units/period) while ignoring early samples that might inflate the variance due to the different early-season pattern.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Lead time instability confirmed. Observed L values of 1 and 2, but also likely lost shipments from P1 and P3. Recent 3-period demand average is 32.3 units, down from initial 40+.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/4/1 (Period 8). The SKU is women's thong underwear. Analysis of arrival history shows significant supply chain disruption: Period 1 order (87 units) and Period 3 order (20 units) are overdue by 5 and 3 periods respectively, confirming they are likely lost. Actual lead times for successful deliveries were 2 periods (P2 order) and 1 period (P5 order). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 148 units are in-transit (reflecting recent aggressive ordering to compensate for losses). Demand is relatively stable but slightly lower than the initial baseline: the last 5 periods average ~29.4 units/week. Given the recurring stockouts (on-hand is 0) and the risk of lost shipments, I need to maintain a higher base stock. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average of successful arrivals, and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (period 3-7) to capture the current demand regime (~31 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of approx 94. The OR backend's inventory balancing will account for the large 'in-transit' pipeline, though if those shipments are also lost, we will remain out of stock until fresh orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Supply reliability remains poor. Orders from P1 and P3 are officially considered lost. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 31 units per week over the last 5 weeks compared to the initial 40-50 range.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9 (2019-04-08), we are managing SKU 464908002. Historical demand reveals a downward trend from an initial average of ~40-50 units/week to a more stable recent average. Over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), mean demand is 35.8 units, while the very recent 3-period average (P6-P8) is 38.3 units. Given the seasonality of lingerie and the transition into spring, I will use a recent_N of 5 to estimate demand (average 36), resulting in a mu_hat of ~108 (36 * (1+2)). The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from P1 (87 units) and P3 (20 units) are considered lost, leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. The In-transit balance of 107 likely represents these lost units + any new orders. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to 'phantom' pipeline inventory that will never arrive, I must maintain a high service level. The actual lead times observed have been 1 and 2 periods, but with frequent losses. I will stick to the promised L=2 but use recent_N=5 for mu and sigma to capture the current demand volatility and prevent stockouts caused by recent supply failures.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10 (2019/4/15), on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has trended upward significantly over the last three weeks (38, 44, 49), averaging 43.7 units, compared to the 31-unit average noted in Period 8. This likely reflects spring seasonality for lingerie/undergarments. Supply reliability is poor: orders from Period 1, 3, 4 (implied zero), and 7 (implied zero) have resulted in lost or non-existent shipments. Current in-transit units (119) include the Period 9 order (12) and potentially older, unreliable quantities. Since we have sold out immediately upon arrival (P8 arrived 41, sold 41), we are currently in a stockout. I will increase mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand (last 3 samples) and set sigma_hat to explicit to provide a higher safety buffer given the supply instability and demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: 3-week average increased from 31 to 44 (+42%), likely seasonal spring growth for womens lingerie. Supply remains highly unreliable with multiple lost shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Liza Thong Low (Malva) 3pk' (Womens Lingerie) is exhibiting a clear seasonal upward trend since April (Period 8-10). The last three demand samples are 44, 49, and 53, following a brief period of stability in the low 30s. This suggests a new demand regime where the average is roughly 48.7 units/period. Supply reliability is a major concern: orders from Period 1 (87 units) and Period 3 (20 units) are confirmed lost. While recent orders (P6, P9) have arrived with lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively, the high stockout frequency (on-hand is 0) necessitates a higher safety stock. I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current growth, and L to 2 (promised/observed max) to ensure sufficient coverage during these stockout-heavy periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased significantly in April, averaging 48.7 units over P8-P10 compared to 31.0 in March (+57%). Supply reliability is poor with 2 known lost shipments (P1, P3).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12 (2019/4/29), we are seeing a significant and sustained increase in demand for this item (Womens Lingerie), which aligns with late spring seasonality. The last 4 periods (P8-P11) have shown demand of 44, 49, 53, and 60, confirming a steady upward regime. The current 3-period average (P9-P11) is 54 units/period. Supply remains highly unreliable: shipments from P1, P3, and now likely P10 (expected P12 conclude) are experiencing issues. Currently on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent persistent stockouts during this growth phase, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the uptrend (avg ~51.5), which results in a base stock covering (1+L) periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals observed so far, though the main constraint is the recurring lost shipments, for which I must rely on the OR backend's inventory balancing against pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand growth confirmed through April: Demand increased from 30s in March to an average of 54.0 units over the last 3 periods (P9-P11), representing a significant seasonal trend.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is May 6, 2019. We are in a high-growth seasonal phase for women's lingerie. Demand has surged from an average of ~31 units in March to ~54 units in April, and most recently peaked at 81 units in Period 12. Combined with the provided historical samples (Jan/Feb), the demand is clearly accelerating. Supply reliability is low: orders from Period 1 and Period 3 were lost, though recent arrivals (P2, P5, P6, P9) show lead times of 1-2 periods. I am setting L to 2 (promised/observed max). For mu_hat, the 3-period average (P10-P12) is 64.6, but the growth is steep (60 to 81), so I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the upward trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 3 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this growth phase. The on-hand is currently 0 with 165 units in-transit (P10: 25, P11: 21, P12: 12, P13: ?), but given previous lost shipments, robust base stock parameters are necessary to recover service levels.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge confirmed entering May: 3-period average rose to 64.7 units, with P12 hitting a series high of 81 (+35% vs prior week). Growth matches seasonal expectations for 'Liza Thong' in late spring.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14 (May 13), the 'Liza Thong' is experiencing a significant seasonal demand surge as we enter late spring. The last 4 periods show mean demand of 59.3 units (60, 81, 43, mean-approximated), which is a clear upward shift from the ~31 unit average in March. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from P1, P3, P10, and P12 are overdue and likely lost (In-transit remains 195 units, far exceeding recent arrivals). Current on-hand is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the next 3 periods of demand (L+1) must be covered. Given the seasonal peak, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand regime, setting \u03bc\u0302 to (1+2)*59.3 \u2248 178 to ensure the OR backend orders enough to combat constant stockouts and account for the high loss rate. Lead time shows variability between 1 and 2 periods, so I will stick with the promised L=2 for safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateaued/corrected in Period 13 (43 units) after a peak of 81, but remains 35% higher than the early-season mean. In-transit volume (195) vs. historical arrivals confirms a high loss/cancellation rate (approx 50-60% of units ordered never arrive).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is May 20th. The product is a 'Liza Thong 3pk' (Womens Lingerie). Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has been 53, 60, 81, 43, 55, averaging 58.4 units per period. This is significantly higher than the early-season mean of ~35, confirming a seasonal spring/summer demand surge. Regarding logistics: The promised lead time is 2, and recent actual lead times have been 2, 2, 1, 2, showing some stability around the promised value after early instability. However, historical performance shows a high rate of lost orders (P1, P3). In-transit inventory is high (190), including orders from P13 (51 units), P14 (7 units), and several older stalled orders. Since the OR backend uses a capped policy based on (1+L)*mu, and we have 0 on-hand, I must ensure mu_hat reflects the current high-demand regime (~58 units/week). Setting N=5 for mu_hat captures this recent regime. Setting N=4 for L reflects the consistent recent behavior of 1 or 2 periods. Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 captures the increased volatility during this peak period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher seasonal mean: P10-P14 average is 58.4 units/week, up from ~35 in early spring (+67%). Supply lead time has stabilized to 1-2 periods for recent arrivals, though cumulative shipment loss remains significant.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16 (2019/5/27), we are in a high-demand seasonal period for 'Liza Thong' (Womens Lingerie). The demand has stabilized in a higher range, with an average of 57.8 units/period over the last 5 weeks (P11-P15: 60, 81, 43, 55, 52), significantly up from the mid-30s earlier in the year. Supply remains a massive constraint: current on-hand inventory is 0 despite continuous demand. There are 196 units in-transit, but many are likely lost (notably the orders from P1, P3, and P13/P14 are overdue or missing). Historical lead times for successful arrivals are 1 or 2 periods (avg ~1.7). To optimize order levels via the OR backend, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the sustained higher demand regime (avg ~58). I am setting L explicitly to 2 to ensure we account for the full promised lead time plus the review period, as recent arrivals have clustered around L=2. This strategy aims to maximize the base stock calculation to trigger the maximum allowed order volume given the current stockouts and high demand, while acknowledging that many in-transit units are likely phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed for late Spring: P11-P15 average demand is 58.2 units, a 66% increase over the base period. In-transit reliability remains poor with an estimated 40-50% shipment loss rate.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for the 'Liza Thong' has reached a sustained high-demand regime for late Spring/early Summer, with the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging 57.0 units per week. Despite this high demand, we are currently stock-out (On-hand: 0) and the pipeline effectiveness is questionable. Recent actual lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (P11, P12 arrived in 2 periods), however, substantial volume (mostly from earlier periods P1 and P3, but also potentially more recent orders) has never arrived, indicating a high shipment loss rate (~45% based on total ordered vs total arrived). With 196 units currently 'in-transit', the OR backend's inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will likely prevent any new orders if it counts all 196 units as valid. To counteract this and capture the current demand surge (~57 units/week), I am using an 'explicit' L of 2 to match the recent effective lead time and 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (1+L)*57 = 171 to reflect the high-seasonal baseline. I will set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked to 106 units, the highest in the series, occurring in early June. This confirms a significant late-spring/early-summer demand surge for this Womens Lingerie item. On-hand inventory remains 0, and despite 190 units being technically 'in-transit', the history shows a critical pattern of lost or significantly delayed shipments (P1, P3, and likely P13 orders have not arrived). Specifically, the P13 order of 51 units is now overdue (placed Period 13, promised L=2, expected arrival by Period 15 conclude). Because the backend OR engine subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the base stock calculation, it will likely not order enough to meet this new demand level if it believes those 190 units are coming. To compensate for the high loss rate and the demand spike, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a higher forecast and 'explicit' L to account for the erratic supply chain behavior observed in the 'conclude' messages. Demand for the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averages 62 units; I will set mu_hat based on a 70 units/period forecast over (L+1) periods to ensure the OR engine targets enough inventory to satisfy the seasonal peak and bypass the 'phantom' pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 17 saw a series high of 106 units, bringing the late-spring average to 62 units/week (+77% over baseline). Supply chain remains highly unreliable; Period 13 order (51 units) is now 2 periods overdue and likely lost, confirming a persistent 40%+ shipment loss rate.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19 (June 17), demand has surged dramatically, hitting a series high of 139 units in Period 18. The last three periods' demand (54, 106, 139) indicates an accelerating seasonal peak (Summer/Holiday prep for Lingerie). The 3-week average is now ~100 units/week. Supply reliability remains the primary constraint: in-transit stock is 247 units, but the Period 13 order (51 units) is now 3 periods overdue and considered lost. The Period 14 (7 units) and Period 15 (6 units) orders arrived on time or are not large enough to bridge the gap. I must aggressively set mu_hat to account for the new demand mean (~100 units/week) and the high likelihood of lost shipments. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (N=3 captures the current surge) and sigma_hat to reflect this growth while mitigating the impact of the 40%+ shipment loss rate observed in the carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge accelerated in mid-June: Period 18 demand hit 139 units, with a 3-week average of 99.7 units (+180% vs early season; +50% vs May average). Period 13 order (51 units) is officially considered lost (4 periods since order, promised L=2). Supply reliability remains extremely poor with a confirmed ~45% aggregate loss rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 (late June). Demand for the 'Liza Thong' has surged significantly as we move into summer, with a recent three-period average of 109.7 units (P17: 106, P18: 139, P19: 84), a roughly 3x increase from the early-season mean. The inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and sold units have been capped by restricted supply for several consecutive periods. Furthermore, supply reliability is extremely poor; roughly 45-50% of ordered units are lost (P1, P3, and P13 orders are confirmed lost). To compensate for the combination of high lost-sale opportunity costs ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) and systemic shipment attrition, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 360. This represents a weekly forecast of ~120 units (current regime) multiplied by (1+L) where L=2. By inflating mu_hat, I force the OR backend to place larger orders that account for the high probability of shipment failure and the current demand peak. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as recent successful arrivals have returned to the 1-2 period range, though the volume must be high to survive the attrition.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime confirmed: 3-period average sustained at 109.7 units (+215% over baseline). Shipment loss rate remains high (~45%), necessitating significant over-ordering to meet service levels.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '464908002' (Liza Thong) is in a peak mid-summer demand regime. Current date is July 1st, 2019. Over the last three periods (P18-P20), demand has averaged 107 units/week (139, 84, 98), which is significantly higher (+200%) than early-season levels and aligns with Carry-over Insights. A critical issue is supply chain reliability; the aggregate shipment loss rate is approximately 45-50% (e.g., P1, P3, and most notably the P13 order of 51 units are lost). This means the 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by ghost inventory that will never arrive. The current in-transit is 414, but at least 51 units (P13) and potentially others are dead stock in the pipeline. To compensate for the high loss rate and current zero on-hand inventory during a peak demand period, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the 100+ units/week trend. sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for recent high volatility (84 to 139). Lead time (L) is set to 'explicit' at 2 to provide a safety buffer, given the frequent delays and the high cost of stockouts relative to holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime sustained: July 1st demand remains high, with the P18-P20 average at 107 units/week. Supply reliability remains the primary constraint; the P13 order (51 units) is officially confirmed lost after 7 periods (promised L=2). Effective pipeline inventory is ~50% of the reported 'In-transit' value due to historical loss rates.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (July 8, 2019), the SKU '464908002' is in a high-demand mid-summer regime, with an average demand of 111.3 units over the last 3 periods (P19-P21). However, the major challenge is a confirmed supply reliability issue. Historically, approximately 45-50% of the units ordered never arrive (e.g., P1, P3, and now P13 orders are officially lost). The OR backend calculates orders based on 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit), but if 50% of In-transit units are ghost inventory, the backend will under-order, leading to stockouts (current on-hand is 0). To compensate for this, I must artificially inflate the demand parameters (mu_hat) so the underlying base-stock calculation accounts for the expected loss rate. I am setting mu_hat to approximately 2x the recent demand average to offset the ~50% shipment loss rate, ensuring the OR engine triggers a sufficient order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. L is kept at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P18) show lead times are still within 1-2 periods when they do arrive.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime (July) sustained at ~110 units/week. Supply reliability remains critical: aggregate shipment loss rate is confirmed at ~45-50%, meaning nearly half of the 'In-transit' balance is effectively lost and will not arrive.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 (July 15), we remain in the peak mid-summer demand regime for 'Liza Thongs'. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) has averaged 109.4 units, confirming a sustained shift from earlier levels. Supply reliability is the primary concern; approximately 45-50% of orders continue to be lost (e.g., P1, P3, P13). At Period 22 START, 'In-transit' was 281. P22 ordered 363, and 109 arrived, leaving (281 + 363 - 109) = 535 'In-transit' logically, but the system reports 668. This discrepancy likely reflects 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments that never concluded. Applying a ~50% reliability factor to the 668 in-transit units suggests an effective pipeline of ~334 units. To ensure the OR engine commands sufficient inventory to meet demand (~110 units/week) despite these losses and a base-stock target covering L+1 (3 periods), mu_hat is set to roughly 3x the current mean. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level and set L to 'explicit=4' to artificially extend the protection window, which compensates for the high shipment loss rate by increasing the safety stock and order trigger levels.

Carry-over insight: Mid-summer demand regime is stable at ~110 units/week (P18-P22 average: 109.4). Supply reliability continues to be the dominant issue with an estimated 45-50% shipment loss rate, requiring inflated base-stock targets to maintain service levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 24 (July 22), the product ('Liza Thong') remains in its mid-summer peak demand regime. The 5-week average demand (P19-P23) is 103 units, which is consistent with the established seasonal trend identified in recent carry-over insights (~110 units/week). Period 23 saw a large arrival of 363 units from the P22 order (lead time = 1), finally alleviating the chronic stockouts. On-hand inventory is now 256 units. However, supply chain reliability remains the critical bottleneck: historically, roughly 45-50% of the 'In-transit' volume is lost. With a current In-transit balance of 305 units, we must assume only ~150 units will actually arrive. To maintain service levels against a weekly demand of ~105-110 units while accounting for the high shipment loss rate, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P19-P23) to capture the current plateau. I'm using L = 2 (promised) as the base, but since the OR engine's order logic is [base_stock - pipeline], and the pipeline is inflated by phantom 'In-transit' units that won't arrive, I am choosing 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to effectively 'over-order' to compensate for the expected 50% loss of the pipeline inventory. The mu_hat value (360) targets enough stock for 3 weeks (L+1) at ~120 units/week to provide a buffer against the loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Inventory recovery in P23 (363 units arrived) ended a prolonged stockout. Demand remains stable in the mid-summer regime (P19-P23 average: 103 units). The 45-50% shipment loss rate remains a persistent factor affecting the reliability of the 'In-transit' metric.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25 (late July), the demand for the 'Liza Thong' remains in its mid-summer regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P20-P24) is 99.6 units, reflecting a stabilization from the June peak but still significantly higher than earlier seasons. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 174 units following the arrival of a large shipment in P23, which resolved a long-standing stockout. However, supply reliability remains a critical bottleneck, with an estimated 45-50% cumulative shipment loss rate (e.g., the P1, P3, and P13 orders never arrived). The 'In-transit' balance of 305 units likely contains 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments. To maintain service levels while accounting for high volatility and shipment unreliability, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the relevant summer demand mean (~100/week) and variance. L is kept at the default (promised 2) as recent visible arrivals (P22-P23) have shown lead times of 1-2 periods, despite the reliability issues.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the 'Liza Thong' remains in its high summer demand regime, though there is a Slight downward trend in recent weeks (P24: 82, P25: 94) compared to the mid-June peak (>100). The last 3-period average is 94.3 units. On-hand inventory is 80 units, and the pipeline shows 305 units in-transit. However, historical data confirms a ~45% shipment loss rate (e.g., P1, P3, P13 orders never arrived). The OR backend's capped policy uses pipeline inventory to reduce orders; if I don't account for these 'ghost' units, the system will under-order. Therefore, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock to compensate for the expected 45% loss rate and the stabilized but high demand. I set L=2 (promised), mu_hat to (1+L) * 100 / (1 - 0.45) \u2248 545, and sigma_hat using recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this transition toward late summer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late summer (P23-P25) at an average of 94.3 units/week. Shipping reliability remains the primary operational risk with a confirmed ~45% aggregate shipment loss rate, requiring base-stock targets to be inflated by ~80% (1/0.55) to maintain availability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27 (mid-August), the demand for 'Liza Thong' is showing initial signs of a post-summer slowdown, dropping to 61 units in Period 26. The 3-period average is now 79 units, down from the June/July peak of ~110. Supply reliability remains the primary operational challenge; historical analysis shows an aggregate shipment loss rate of ~45-50%. The current 'In-transit' figure of 485 is misleadingly high because 115 units from Period 19 (ordered 8 weeks ago) and 180 units from Period 26 are the primary components. Specifically, the P19 order is almost certainly lost. This persists the need to inflate the base-stock target. Using mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) captures the recent deceleration while maintaining enough safety stock to handle lead-time variability. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'calculate' is used as recent successful arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration observed in August: P24-P26 average is 79 units, compared to the P21-P23 average of 111. SHIPMENT LOSS CONFIRMED: Period 19 order (115 units) is now 8 weeks overdue and officially considered lost, bringing the cumulative loss rate to ~48%.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (August 19, 2019), the SKU '464908002' is in a seasonal decline following a mid-summer peak. Recent demand (P24-P27) has dropped to an average of 74.3 units/week, down from the ~110 units/week observed in July. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward trend (average demand ~74, scaled by 1+L). Supply reliability remains the critical challenge: with an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit balance of 485, the 'in-transit' metric is highly deceptive due to a confirmed ~48% cumulative shipment loss rate. Specifically, the P19 order (115 units) and P21 order (which was 0) leave the P26 order (180 units) as the only realistically expected pending arrival. To compensate for the ~50% reliability, I am using L=explicit=5. This 'inflates' the base stock calculation by expanding the protection window, which effectively forces the OR backend to order more units to offset the high probability of shipment failure, ensuring we maintain service levels despite the frequent losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed in August: 4-week average (P24-P27) is 74.3 units, a 32% decrease from the July peak of 110. Supply reliability remains a permanent constraint with a ~48% aggregate shipment loss rate; the 'In-transit' figure is roughly 50% accurate.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is late August (2019-08-26). Demand has entered a clear deceleration phase after the July peak (~110 units). The 4-week average (P24-P27) is 74.3 units, but the most recent two weeks showed demand stabilized near 60 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect this downward trend (average ~71 units). Supply reliability remains the critical issue: of the 485 units 'In-transit', 122 units (orders from P19 and P20) are far past their lead time and likely lost, while the P26 order (180 units) is due now/next. The aggregate shipment loss rate remains near 50%. To compensate for this 50% loss rate and high demand volatility during the transition to autumn, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly slightly higher than the raw recent stats. This ensures the OR backend targets a base-stock that accounts for the fact that roughly half of the pipeline inventory is phantom.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed through August: demand shifted from a July peak of ~110 units to an August mean of ~71 units (-35%). Shipment loss rate is sustained at ~48-50%, meaning the OR 'In-transit' metric overestimates actual future arrivals by approximately 2x.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019-09-02. Demand has officially decelerated from the July peak (~110 units) to an August mean of 63.3 units (P26-P29). We are entering September, which typically sees a further cooling or stabilization in summer underwear categories. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0), and we have 485 units In-transit. However, historical performance shows a ~48% shipment loss rate; therefore, the effective pipeline is only ~250 units. While the OR engine sees 485, it will refrain from ordering. This is appropriate as 250 units covers nearly 4 weeks of current demand (L+1 = 3 periods). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the August deceleration (average 63.25), and keep L at default (promised 2) since recent successful arrivals showed 1-2 periods. This strategy ensures we don't over-order during a seasonal decline while the backend perceives a large (but partially phantom) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed for late summer/early autumn: August mean demand is 63.3 units/week, down 42% from the July peak. Effective pipeline is estimated at 50-55% of the reported 'In-transit' value due to persistent shipment losses.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 31 (Sept 9, 2019). Demand has transitioned from a summer peak of ~110 units/week to a late-summer/early-autumn mean of approximately 63 units/week (last 4 periods: 60, 61, 71, 61). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 485 units reported 'In-transit'. However, historical data shows a massive shipment loss rate of approximately 50%. Notably, the 180 units ordered in Period 26 are now overdue (P30 conclude showed 0 arrivals; expected arrival was P28/P29). The Period 19 order (115 units) is confirmed lost. Given this, the current 'In-transit' of 485 is highly unreliable. To counter the loss rate and demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the 60-70 unit regime. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent delays and losses, which forces the OR backend to look further ahead and place larger orders to compensate for the 'thin' actual pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for early autumn (Sept) at ~63 units/week, down 42% from July peak. Shipping reliability remains the primary bottleneck; the Period 26 order (180 units) is overdue and potentially lost, maintaining the cumulative loss rate at ~50%.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is September 16, 2019. Demand has transitioned from a summer peak (~110 units) to an autumn level of ~63 units/week (last 5 periods: 60, 61, 71, 61, 43). I am currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The primary challenge is the 'In-transit' figure of 485, which includes the Period 19 order (115 units, now 13 weeks old) and the Period 26 order (180 units, now 6 weeks old). Based on historical performance and carry-over insights, the shipment loss rate for this SKU is approximately 50%. This means of the 485 units in-transit, roughly 240-250 units are likely phantom inventory that will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to signal the need for a higher base stock. Given a stabilized demand of ~60 units and a lead time (L) of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 180 units. However, because ~50% of the recorded pipeline is lost, I need to adjust mu_hat upward to roughly double the expected demand (360) to force the OR calculation (base_stock - pipeline) to actually generate an order. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized for early autumn (Sept) at ~55-60 units/week, down from the summer peak. Shipping reliability remains critical: Period 19 (115 units) and Period 26 (180 units) orders are significantly overdue and confirmed lost, maintaining the ~50% aggregate shipment loss rate. The 'In-transit' metric currently overestimates real arrivals by ~295 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Liza Thong' has continued to decelerate since the July peak (~110 units), stabilizing into an early autumn regime. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P30-P32) is 47.3 units, down from the June/July highs. The primary operational challenge remains extreme supply unreliability. As noted in the carry-over insights, orders from Period 19 (115 units) and Period 26 (180 units) are significantly past their promised lead time (L=2) and are officially considered lost. This brings the cumulative shipment loss rate to approximately 50%. The current 'In-transit' balance of 485 units is misleading because 295 of those units (P19 + P26) are confirmed lost, leaving only 190 units of potentially valid pipeline. To compensate for this 50% loss rate and the current stockout (On-hand = 0), I am setting mu_hat using an 'explicit' value. This value is calculated as (1 + Promised_L) * Current_Demand_Mean * (1 / Arrival_Probability). With L=2, Demand\u224854, and Arrival_Prob\u22480.5, the targeted base stock must be approximately 324 [(1+2)*54*2]. Setting mu_hat to 324 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high variance in both demand and supply ensures the OR engine places a large enough order to overcome the 'In-transit' phantom inventory and the high probability of shipment failure.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Sept average (P30-P32) is 47.3 units/week. Supply loss rate confirmed at 50%: Orders from P19 (115 units) and P26 (180 units) are lost. Effective in-transit is 190 units, not 485.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 34 (Sept 30, 2019), the demand has entered an autumn stabilization phase, with the last 4 periods (P30-P33) averaging 49.5 units. This is a significant drop from the summer peak of ~110 units. Supply chain reliability remains extremely poor. Orders from P19 (115 units) and P26 (180 units) are confirmed lost after exceeding promised lead times by several weeks. Total in-transit is reported at 485, but with 295 units (115+180) lost, the effective pipeline is only 190. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive, non-existent inventory and failing to order, I must treat the pipeline loss as a lead-time/demand inflation problem. Since I cannot directly subtract from 'In-transit', I will set mu_hat to cover higher demand, effectively forcing an order. However, since we are currently stocked out (on-hand=0) and actual effective in-transit is likely near 0 or consisting of very old, questionable orders, I will use an explicit forecast that accounts for the current 50 unit/week baseline plus safety stock to resume service.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed: Sept average (P30-P33) is ~50 units/week. Supply loss rate remains at ~50%: P19 and P26 orders are officially lost. Effective pipeline is 190 units, not 485.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019/10/07), the SKU 464908002 (Liza Thong) is in a seasonal decline phase following a mid-summer peak. Demand has stabilized at an autumn regime of approximately 50 units per week (the mean of the last 5 periods P30-P34 is 48.0). Inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and while 'In-transit' is reported as 485 units, historical analysis confirms a ~50% shipment loss rate. Specifically, the Period 19 order (115 units) and Period 26 order (180 units) are significantly overdue and officially considered lost, accounting for 295 units of the phantom pipeline. The effective pipeline is only 190 units (from orders placed in P13/P14/P15/P18 that may still be in some state of limbo or more recent undocumented orders, although the history shows no orders were placed between P27-P34). Given the current stockout and the risk that all 485 units are lost, I must set parameters to trigger a replenishment. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the 48-unit/week autumn regime, and an explicit lead time of 2 (promised) to reset the OR calculation against the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 36 (Oct 14, 2019), the demand for 'Liza Thong' has stabilized into an autumn regime, averaging 48.6 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the reported 'In-transit' of 485 units is highly misleading. History shows a persistent ~50% shipment loss rate. Specifically, the Period 19 order (115 units) and Period 26 order (180 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. The remaining 190 units in-transit (from P22 onwards) have not arrived. Since actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods, and we are currently out of stock, I will set 'L' to an explicit value of 2 to ensure the base stock covers the lead time plus the review period. To compensate for the ~50% shipment loss rate and the fact that the OR engine subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I estimate real demand at ~50 units/week. Over (L+1)=3 periods, this is 150 units. However, because the backend will subtract 485 (In-transit) - but only 190 units might actually arrive - I need to inflate mu_hat significantly to trigger an order that compensates for known lost shipments and current stockout. I will target a base stock that overrides the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed stable at ~49 units/week (P31-P35 avg). Cumulative shipment loss rate remains at ~50%, with P19 (115 units) and P26 (180 units) officially recorded as lost, meaning the 'In-transit' metric overestimates actual arrivals by 295 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Liza Thong' (464908002) has stabilized in an autumn regime, averaging approximately 43.8 units/week over the last 5 periods (P32-P36). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with a reported 616 units in-transit. However, historical performance shows a severe supply reliability issue; orders from P19 (115 units) and P26 (180 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 295 units of 'phantom' inventory in the In-transit figure. Subtracting these, the effective pipeline is 321 units (616 - 295). This effective pipeline includes the P36 order of 131 units and other units ordered between P26 and P36 that have not yet arrived or been explicitly confirmed lost. Given L=2, the OR logic targets (1+L) periods of demand. To compensate for the 295 lost units the OR backend still considers 'real', I must adjust the mu_hat parameter. Setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand plus the lost inventory volume (Demand * (1+L) + Lost Units) ensures the backend places a corrective order to reach a true safety stock, rather than relying on phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime confirmed stable at ~44 units/week (P32-P36). Cumulative shipment loss of 295 units (P19, P26) is permanent, requiring 'explicit' mu_hat adjustments to manually override the OR backend's dependence on inaccurate 'In-transit' data.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 28, 2019, entering late Autumn. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime of approximately 44 units/period (P32-P37 average). The central challenge remains the systemic shipment loss rate of ~50%. Specifically, orders from P19 (115 units) and P26 (180 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. These 295 ghost units stay in the OR backend's 'In-transit' metric (currently 616 units), causing it to believe the pipeline is saturated when the 'effective' pipeline is actually only 321 units. To prevent stockouts caused by the backend under-ordering due to these ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand). Required stock = 3 * 44 = 132. However, because the backend subtracts the full (inaccurate) pipeline of 616 units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 748 (132 + 616) to force the backend to recognize that even with the 'in-transit' units, we need more stock. This ensures a replenishment trigger despite the inflated pipeline data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in an autumn regime, averaging approximately 43 units per week over the last four periods (P35-P38). The primary challenge remains the systemic unreliability of the 'In-transit' metric. Historically, orders from P19 (115 units) and P26 (180 units) are confirmed lost, while the status of the P36 order (131 units) is currently unknown (entering its 3rd period since order). Total 'In-transit' is reported as 760, but based on the ~48-50% cumulative loss rate seen throughout the game, only about 380 units are expected to actually arrive. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom inventory from P19 and P26 (295 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock using the current demand mean (~43) for the Lead Time + Review window (1+2=3 periods), then manually add back the 295 units of lost pipeline to ensure the 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction in the OR engine results in a sufficient order. Estimated target = (43 units/week * 3 weeks) + 295 lost units = ~424 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed shipment loss remains at 295 units (P19=115, P26=180). Current demand mean for November is ~43 units/week. Effective pipeline is ~60% of reported In-transit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (Nov 11), the demand for 'Liza Thong' has settled into an autumn baseline, with the last 4 periods averaging 39 units. The Period 36 order (131 units) arrived in Period 39 with a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that recent shipments are arriving, albeit with slightly extended lead times compared to the promised 2. A major accounting issue remains with the 'In-transit' metric: 295 units (from P19 and P26) are permanently lost but still reflect in the backend's pipeline. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 40 units/week and a lead time of 3 (covering 4 periods of risk = 160 units). I then manually ADD the 295 lost units to this target (160 + 295 = 455) so the backend's subtraction of 629 in-transit units correctly accounts for the fact that nearly 300 of those units don't exist. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Lead time for recent successful shipment confirmed at 3 periods (P36 order arrived P39). Phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains at 295 units (P19, P26), requiring manual inflation of base stock targets to offset the backend's pipeline calculation.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41 (Nov 18, 2019), the demand for 'Liza Thong' has stabilized in an autumn/pre-holiday regime, averaging ~36.8 units over the last 5 periods (P36-P40). Supply reliability remains the critical challenge. We have 295 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from confirmed lost shipments in P19 (115) and P26 (180). Currently, the system reports 629 units in transit; however, adjusting for these 295 lost units, the effective pipeline is only 334 units. To ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock despite this inflated pipeline metric, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock of roughly 5 periods of demand (~200 units), accounting for the current lead time of 3 periods observed in P39. By setting mu_hat to 500, the OR engine (after the 0.8 service level factor) will target a base stock high enough to trigger the necessary ordering once the effective inventory dips, essentially buffering against the hidden loss of one-third of our stated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective pipeline is approximately 53% of reported In-transit due to 295 confirmed lost units (P19, P26). Current demand regime (Nov) is stable at ~37 units/week.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42 (Nov 25), the demand regime has stabilized at a late-autumn mean of approximately 36 units per week (P36-P41 average is 34.3). The 'In-transit' figure of 629 units is highly misleading due to 295 confirmed lost units (P19: 115, P26: 180). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 334 units (629 - 295). Of this, 144 units (ordered P38) are expected to arrive imminently, as the recent observed lead time was 3 periods (P36 order arrived P39). With on-hand inventory at 52 units and demand at ~35 units, the effective pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders based on the 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=2 promised + 1 delay) plus 1 review period: (3+1) * 36 = 144 units. Since the effective pipeline (334) + on-hand (52) = 386 units, which is well above the target, the OR engine should correctly order 0 units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 2, 2019. Demand for the 'Liza Thong' (Women's Lingerie) has settled into a late-autumn/early-winter regime, averaging 31.0 units/week over the last 4 periods (P39-P42). Supply chain reliability remains a major issue: the 'In-transit' balance of 629 units is heavily inflated by 295 confirmed lost units (P19=115, P26=180). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 334 units (comprised of the P38 order of 144 units and recent unfulfilled orders). Recent successful lead time was observed at 3 periods (P36 order). To compensate for the 295 'phantom' units that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the order quantity, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to manually inflate the target inventory. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=3 and mean demand=31, base stock = 4 * 31 = 124. To offset the 295 lost units the backend thinks I have, I set mu_hat to 124 + 295 = 419. This ensures the OR engine places an order if the effective inventory drops below the safety threshold, despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime for early winter (Dec) is stable at ~31 units/week (P39-P42 avg). Persistence of 295 'phantom' in-transit units (P19, P26) confirmed. Effective pipeline is only ~53% of reported value.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Demand for this SKU (thong briefs) has stabilized at a winter seasonal low, with the last 5 periods (P39-P43) averaging 25.4 units per week, following a significant drop from the summer peak. The 'In-transit' figure of 629 is highly misleading due to historical shipment losses. Specifically, orders from P19 (115 units) and P26 (180 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 295 'phantom' units. Subtracting these from the current 629 in-transit units leaves an effective pipeline of 334 units. However, given the current low demand (approx 25/week) and the high on-hand + effective pipeline, we are significantly over-stocked for the remainder of the year. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the most recent successful arrival (P36), and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current winter demand regime (mean ~25.4, std ~10.4). This will prevent unnecessary further ordering by allowing the OR backend to see that the existing (real) pipeline more than covers the target base stock, especially since the OR engine will still see the full 629 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Dec) confirmed: Mean demand has dropped to 25.4 units/week (P39-P43), a 77% decrease from the July peak. Cumulative shipment loss remains at 295 units (P19, P26), meaning the 'In-transit' metric overestimates arrival reality by nearly 50%.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 45 of 47). Current demand is in a winter low, averaging ~25 units/week over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). Inventory is currently zero on-hand. The total 'In-transit' is 629 units. However, we have 295 units confirmed lost from early periods (P19: 115, P26: 180), and the P38 order (144 units) is now at its promised lead time (L=2) but hasn't arrived yet (expected arrival in P41-P43 given recent L=3 behavior). The remaining 190 units in transit consist of newer orders (from P36 onwards, though P36 already arrived). Actually, checking the history, 629 units in-transit minus the 295 lost (P19, P26) leaves 334 units. P38 (144 units) is still outstanding. With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), we must avoid over-ordering and incurring high holding costs on units that arrive too late to be sold. I will set mu_hat using a recent N=5 to capture the winter demand drop (~25 units) and set L=2 for the OR backend, which will likely result in a recommendation of zero or very few units given the high (even if partially phantom) in-transit balance.

Carry-over insight: Winter demand regime (Dec) is very low, averaging ~25 units/week (P40-P44). 295 units of 'In-transit' are confirmed long-term losses (P19, P26).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in late December (Period 46). Demand has significantly cooled from the summer peak (~110 units) to a winter mean of approximately 25-30 units/week. The item is a '3pk Liza Thong', which typically sees lower demand in winter. The primary issue remains the 'In-transit' metric: 295 units (from P19 and P26) are confirmed long-term losses, yet they remain in the backend's pipeline calculation. Current total In-transit is 629. If we subtract the 295 lost units, the effective pipeline is 334 units (mostly from the P38 order of 144 units). With on-hand at 0 and a current stable demand mean of ~27 units (avg of last 5 periods), the effective pipeline of 334 units exceeds our target base stock (approx 100-120 units for 3-4 weeks of coverage). Therefore, we do not need to order more. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering in the future due to the 295 phantom units, I continue using 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target, effectively neutralizing the phantom inventory, though in this specific period, the effective pipeline is already sufficient.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (late December/year-end). Demand for 'Liza Thong' (womens lingerie) has significantly declined from its summer peak (~110 units) to a stable winter regime of approximately 25-30 units per week. The 5-period average (P42-P46) is 25.6 units. The product's supply chain is highly unreliable, with a confirmed cumulative loss of 295 units from orders placed in Period 19 (115 units) and Period 26 (180 units). These units remain in the 'In-transit' metric indefinitely, creating a persistent 'phantom' inventory of 295 units. Current 'In-transit' is reported as 629. After subtracting the 295 lost units, the effective pipeline is 334 units (comprised largely of the P38 order of 144 units and recent logic adjustments). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 295 phantom units and targets the current low-demand winter regime (~26 units/week), I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, I use (1+L) * 26 = 78. This overrides the backend's internal calculation which would otherwise count the 295 lost units as forthcoming supply and fail to place necessary replenishments if on-hand hits zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Winter demand regime confirmed stable at ~26 units/week. Effective pipeline is 334 units, as 295 units of reported 'In-transit' (P19, P26) are permanently lost. Forecast remains low through early January.
