Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for the Nora T-shirt, a basic women's garment. Historical demand shows 5 samples: 30, 27, 70, 72, 56. There is a clear shift in demand starting Jan 21st (Period 3), where the average jumped from ~28.5 to ~66 (+131%). This looks like the start of a spring/early-season ramp-up for a basic jersey T-shirt. Given the current date in mid-February, I expect demand to stabilize at these higher levels rather than revert to January lows. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to order immediately. I will use the last 3 samples (N=3) to estimate demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this higher regime. I'll stick with the default promised lead time (L=2) as we have no delivery history yet. The backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters to ensure coverage for the next 3 weeks (current period + 2 weeks lead time).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. Looking at the historical demand (Jan 7-Feb 4): 30, 27, 70, 72, 56. In Period 1 (Feb 11), demand was 70. However, because on-hand inventory was 0 at the start of Period 1, we sold 0 units. We have 81 units in-transit from the order placed in Period 1. Based on the promised lead time of 2, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in Period 3 conclude/Period 4 decision). Since we started with 0 inventory and missed the Period 1 demand, we need to ensure our base stock covers the demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). The demand pattern shows a clear step-up starting in late January (from ~30 to ~65). I will use the last 4 samples (including Period 1) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the current higher demand regime. L is set to 'default' (2).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting 2019-01-21: average demand increased from ~28 to ~67 based on the last four weeks.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). Demand has significantly increased, with the last two periods showing 70 and 136 units respectively, compared to the initial historical mean (~28). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (81 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 161 units in-transit (81 from P1, 80 from P2). I will set L to default (2). For mu_hat, the 'recent_N' method with N=3 will be used to capture the recent sharp upward trend in demand (70, 72, 56 from historical samples plus recent high volatility). This will ensure the base stock is high enough to handle the increased demand regime while accounting for the lead time delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed: Demand has shifted from ~28 to >100 in Period 2, indicating a potential seasonal trend for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts as Spring approaches.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4 (2019-03-04). The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt. Historical data showed a baseline demand of ~28-30, but since late January/early February, demand has surged significantly (70, 72, 56, 70, 136, 111), likely due to pre-Spring seasonality for basics. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 319 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (81 units), P2 (80 units), and P3 (158 units) are all in-transit. According to the lead time definition, the P1 order (ordered 2019-02-11) should arrive during P3's resolution and become visible in P3 conclude. However, P3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a delay or a lead time longer than the promised 2 periods (actual L >= 3). Since we have had zero stock since P1, maximizing the base stock is critical to capture this high-demand period once stock arrives. I will set L to 3 to reflect the observed delay and use the last 4 periods (P1-P3 conclude demand plus the last available sample) to capture the new high-demand regime (avg ~97 per week). mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*avg_demand = 4 * 97 = 388.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods: P1 order (2019-02-11) did not arrive by P3 conclude, suggesting L >= 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we finally saw an arrival: 80 units ordered in Period 2 arrived during Period 4 (lead time = 2). However, the Period 1 order (81 units) is now 4 periods old (placed 2019-02-11, currently 2019-03-11) and has not concluded, suggesting it is a lost shipment. We must reconcile the pipeline by excluding these 81 units. Current on-hand is 0. Recent demand (P1-P4) shows a clear regime shift: 70, 136, 111, 92 (average ~102). As this is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' Nora T-shirt entering the Spring season (March), demand is significantly higher than the initial Jan/Feb samples (avg ~51). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon, I will set L to 2 (promised), as P2's arrival was on time, but use recent demand history (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, accounting for the higher sustained demand level and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 1 order (81 units) likely lost: 4 periods elapsed without arrival. P2 arrival confirms promised lead time of 2 is still viable for active shipments. Sustained high demand regime (avg 102 vs initial 51) confirmed for Spring season transition.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6 (2019-03-18), we are managing the 'Nora T-shirt', a women's everyday staple. Recent demand history (samples: 30, 27, 70, 72, 56; recent periods: 70, 136, 111, 92, 70) indicates a strong upward shift compared to the initial baseline, averaging ~96 units/period over the last 5 weeks as we move into the Spring season. Currently, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) with a large pipeline (371 units). The Period 1 order (81 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. However, the Period 2 order arrived exactly in 2 periods (arriving Period 4), confirming the promised lead time of L=2 is the correct operational baseline for successful deliveries. For parameters: L is set to 'default' (2 periods). mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the high-demand regime since late January) to capture the seasonal average (~96 * 3 = 288). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the increased volatility (std \u2248 26) seen in this higher volume period, ensuring the OR backend builds a sufficient safety buffer to recover from the current stockout.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 (2019-03-25). Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has stabilized in a high-demand regime for the Spring season. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 94.5 units (70, 136, 111, 92, 70, 88). On-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts, and 371 units are in-transit. The Period 1 order (81 units) is officially confirmed as lost (6 periods elapsed). The Period 3 order (158 units) should have arrived in Period 5 (L=2) but hasn't appeared yet; however, based on the P2 arrival in P4, we maintain L=2 as the baseline but will monitor for systemic delays. Because of the loss of the P1 order and the delay of the P3 order, we need to ensure the parameters reflect the current high-demand reality. I am setting L to 'default' (2), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 (covering the Spring regime) to capture the ~95 units/period average, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the observed volatility (std dev ~23).

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 3 order (158 units) is now 2 periods overdue (ordered P3, expected P5 conclude), further suggesting potential logistical instability or specific shipment delays despite P2 arriving on time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: Today is 2019-04-01. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'Nora T-shirt' remains high as we are in the Spring season transition (avg ~102/period). We have a significant in-transit pipeline of 371 units, but logistical issues are evident: the Period 1 order (81 units) is certainly lost, and the Period 3 order (158 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered Period 3, promised lead time 2, should have arrived by Period 5 conclude). Interestingly, the Period 2 order arrived exactly on time (L=2) during Period 4. This indicates intermittent shipment loss rather than a permanent lead-time shift to L=3. Because we have 0 on-hand and orders are frequently lost or delayed, I must maintain an aggressive base stock to capture future arrivals. I will use 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the promised (and occasionally realized) lead time, but use recent high-demand samples (N=5 from periods including P7 back to P3 where demand stabilized in the ~70-144 range) to ensure mu_hat reflects the current Spring regime. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the current demand mean (~101) and high volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment instability confirmed: Period 1 (81 units) and Period 3 (158 units) shipments are likely lost or severely delayed (P3 is now 3 periods overdue). Spring seasonal demand regime is stable with an average of ~102 units/period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 (2019-04-08). The product is a staple women's t-shirt ('Jersey Basic') which exhibits a high demand regime during the Spring transition. Since 2019-01-21, demand has averaged ~102 units/period, but more recently (last two weeks) it has hit 144 units/period, suggesting a sustained peak. Crucially, the supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 1 (81 units) and Period 3 (158 units) are statistically 'lost' (P1 is 8 periods old, P3 is 6 periods old, vs. a 2-period promised lead time). Only the P2 shipment arrived successfully. On-hand inventory is 0, and current in-transit (371 units) consists of the lost P1/P3 units and the P4 order (132 units). The P4 order is now 5 periods old and should have arrived at P6; it is 3 periods overdue. Because the OR backend counts all 'In-transit' units against the target, I must adjust the parameters to force new orders despite the phantom inventory. I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the peak demand (avg ~144) over the look-ahead period (L+1) while choosing an explicit Lead Time 'L' of 4 to reflect the current reality of delays and losses, ensuring the backend calculates a much higher base stock to overcome the 371 units of 'In-transit' that are likely never arriving.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply failure: Orders from P1, P3, and now P4 (ordered 2019-03-04) are significantly overdue or lost, suggesting actual lead times are unreliable or infinite for many shipments. Demand has stabilized at a higher peak of ~144 units over the last 2 weeks.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 10 (2019-04-15). The item is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt, which is in peak spring demand. Historical demand over the last 3 weeks (Periods 7-9) has been 144, 144, and 136, averaging ~141 units/period. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern: orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 are missing and likely lost. Only the Period 2 order arrived successfully with the promised lead time of 2. Due to the high stockout frequency (on-hand is 0) and missing shipments, I must set the lead time parameter 'L' higher to compensate for the instability, effectively treating the 'systemic supply failure' noted in insights as an increase in the required coverage duration. I will set L to 4 (double the promise) to force the OR engine to account for longer cycles. mu_hat will be set to (1+L)*141 = 705 to cover current peak demand. sigma_hat is set to roughly 15% of demand to handle volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked and stabilized at ~141 units/week for the last 3 weeks (Period 7-9). Massive supply failure confirmed: P1, P3, and P4 orders are lost, meaning ~370 units in-transit are likely non-existent.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11 (2019/4/22), we see the 'Nora T-shirt' continues to experience high demand consistent with a 'Womens Everyday Basics' spring peak. Demand over the last four periods (Periods 7-10) has been 144, 144, 136, 147, averaging ~143 units/period. The supply chain has shown extreme volatility: orders from Periods 1, 3, and 4 (371 units total) are definitively lost as they are many weeks past the promised 2-period lead time. However, the order from Period 9 arrived in just 1 period (Period 10), and the Period 10 order is expected to arrive in Period 11 or 12. Current in-transit is 545, but after subtracting the 371 lost units, only 174 units (from Period 10) are actually expected. With 53 on-hand and 174 in-transit, we have 227 units to cover demand. I will set L to 2 (promised) as the 1-period arrival might be an outlier. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable high-demand regime of ~143. This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~430 units), triggering an order to close the gap.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation: Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (371 units total). Recent supply (P9) showed a lead time of 1 period, but stability is unconfirmed. Demand has stabilized at a high-seasonal plateau of ~143 units/week (Periods 7-10).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the SKU (Nora T-shirt) is in a high-demand Spring season. Recent demand at Period 11 spiked significantly to 212 units, up from a previously stable plateau of ~143. The 4-week average (P8-P11) is now 159.75 units/period. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: orders from P1 (81), P3 (158), and P4 (132) are confirmed lost, totaling 371 'phantom' units in the in-transit pipeline. The OR backend uses pipeline inventory (545 units) to calculate order quantities; if we don't adjust, it will assume we have 545 units coming and order nothing, while 371 of those units will never arrive. To compensate, I must set mu_hat explicitly to 'bypass' this pipeline inflation. Effective pipeline = 545 - 371 = 174 units (which matches the P10 order). I need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using the recent 4-week average of ~160, total target inventory should be 480. Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (545), I will set mu_hat to 480 + 371 = 851. This ensures the backend orders enough to reach the real target of 480 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 11: jumped from ~144 to 212 (+47%). Seasonal plateau may be moving to a higher peak. Supply chain remains bifurcated: 371 units (P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost, while recent shipments (P9) show short lead times (1 period).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13 (2019-05-06), the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) is in a high-demand seasonal peak. Current demand over the last two periods (P11-P12) has plateaued at an average of 200 units (212 and 188), which is a significant increase from the previous ~143 unit plateau. Supply chain visibility remains poor: 371 units from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost and must be ignored in the pipeline calculations. The OR backend's pipeline inventory count includes these lost units, so I must adjust my parameters to force an order. Since 'in-transit' is 887 and 371 are lost, the functional pipeline is 516. However, to ensure the OR engine delivers enough stock to meet the 200 units/week demand (plus safety stock), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the most recent high-demand regime (last 2 periods). I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to set the base stock level (target pipeline) high enough to overcome the 'phantom' inventory currently sitting in the system's pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg increased to ~200 units/week (last 2 periods @ 212, 188). This follows the previous plateau of ~143 units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is mid-May (2019-05-13), a peak season for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts. Demand has stabilized at a high level, though the most recent demand (132) shows a slight dip from the previous two-week surge (212, 188). The average demand over the last four periods (Periods 10-13) is 170 units. Inventory is currently critical; on-hand is 0, and the pipeline is heavily skewed by 371 units confirmed lost (Periods 1, 3, 4). The 'In-transit' of 887 includes these lost units plus orders from P10 (174 units), P12 (342 units), and P14. P10 (ordered 2019-04-15) is now 4 periods old and likely represents another lost or significantly delayed shipment, as P9 arrived in 1 period. Only the P12 order (342 units) is within a reasonable arrival window. Given the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), the model must be aggressive in inventory recovery. I will set mu_hat to cover the recent average demand of 170 units/period (total 510 for L+1=3) to account for the current seasonal plateau, despite the recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: Period 10 order (174 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered P10, expected ~P11/P12), suggesting it may be lost alongside P1, P3, and P4. Demand average for the last 4 periods (P10-13) is 170 units/week.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019-05-20), the Nora T-shirt continues to show strong seasonal demand. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 166 units/week (212, 188, 132, 154). The supply chain remains unreliable: we have confirmed the loss of P1, P3, P4, and now likely P10 (totaling 545 units in-transit that will likely never arrive). The current in-transit (545 units) is entirely composed of these stalled shipments. Therefore, the pipeline inventory used by the OR backend (on-hand + in-transit) accurately reflects zero usable incoming stock. I will set mu_hat to cover the current 3-period demand horizon (L+1) using an explicit value of 498 (166 avg * 3 periods) and set a high sigma_hat to account for demand volatility and supply risk. Lead time is set to explicit=2 to match the most recent successful delivery (P12 order).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed loss of Period 10 order (174 units); total lost in-transit inventory is now 545 units (P1, P3, P4, P10). Demand for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged ~166 units, sustaining the Spring/Summer seasonal peak.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in its peak Spring/Summer season (late May). Demand has averaged 175 units over the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 212, 188, 132, 154, 193). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 545 units is confirmed to be composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. To trigger a new order, I must set the base stock high enough to overcome this 'ghost' pipeline. Recent successful arrivals from P9 (L=1) and P12 (L=2) suggest that while lead times are volatile, an L=2 expectation is reasonable for those that arrive. I will use 'explicit' values to account for the lost stock: L=2, mu_hat = 175 * (1+2) = 525, plus an adjustment to offset the 545 phantom units, targeting a total base stock around 1100 to ensure an order is generated and service level is maintained during this peak demand period.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3, 2019. Demand for this Nora T-shirt (Womens Everyday Basics) is in a high-sustained summer peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 198 units. Period 16 showed a spike to 223 units, suggesting continued strength. Supply chain analysis: 545 units from periods 1, 3, 4, and 10 are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 965, but 545 of that is phantom inventory. Therefore, the effective pipeline is (965 - 545) = 420 (the order from P16). To ensure the backend places an order that covers the current demand of ~200 units/period (totaling ~600 for L+1), I am setting mu_hat to 600 using the explicit method. Since on-hand is 0 and the backend sees an inflated pipeline of 965, an explicit mu_hat of 600 + the 545 lost units (= 1145) is necessary to force a non-zero order, but due to the backend's internal 'cap' based on mu_hat, I will set mu_hat to reflects the elevated demand regime (avg ~200) to allow the OR engine to order sufficiently to meet upcoming demand, while accounting for the fact that the 'in-transit' units it sees for P1, P3, P4 and P10 will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked at Period 16 (223 units); 5-period average (P12-P16) is 198 units/week. Lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10) total 545 units of phantom 'in-transit' inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. We are in the high-demand Spring/Summer season for women's jersey t-shirts. Demand has stabilized at a high plateau, with the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averaging 184 units/week and the recent 2 periods (P16-P17) showing a spike to ~220 units. On-hand inventory is 202 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 545 is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10), so effective pipeline inventory is 0. Recent successful deliveries (P9, P12, P16) show an actual lead time of 1-2 periods (average 1.33). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P12-P17) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~198). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to account for the increased volatility in this peak season. Our objective is to maintain a high service level to capture $4 profit per unit while acknowledging the risk of lost shipments by keeping orders frequent rather than massive.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has reached a high-seasonal plateau. Over the last 7 periods (P12-P18), demand has averaged 181.4 units/week, with a peak of 223 in P16 and a recent dip to 142 in P18. The supply chain history confirms that shipments from Period 1 (81 units), Period 3 (158 units), Period 4 (132 units), and Period 10 (174 units) are lost, totaling 545 units of phantom 'in-transit' inventory. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from its order calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat values to compensate for this 545-unit deficit. Based on the recent 7-period average, expected demand over the (L+1) horizon (where L=2) is approximately 544 units (181.4 * 3). However, to trigger any order from the backend while it sees 545 units in-transit and 60 on-hand, the base_stock (mu_hat + safety stock) must exceed 605. I will set mu_hat to 1150 (roughly 545 phantom + 605 required) and sigma_hat to 120 to ensure the OR engine places an order to replenish stock before the current 60 units are depleted, accounting for the massive in-transit error.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 24, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has entered a high-activity summer regime, averaging 197 units/period over the last 9 periods (P11-P19). The supply chain remains extremely unreliable: we have 1,043 units reported 'in-transit', but history shows that P1 (81), P3 (158), P4 (132), and P10 (174) orders are almost certainly lost, totaling 545 phantom units. This leaves an active pipeline of only 498 units (ordered P19). To maintain service levels given this phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current 3-period demand window (L+1) while the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) is misled by the 545 lost units. By setting mu_hat high (total demand for L+1 plus the lost unit volume), I force the OR engine to place an order that compensates for the missing stock. I estimate demand at ~200/period; thus (L+1)*200 = 600. To offset the 545 lost units, mu_hat is set to 1145. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the promised window, although actual arrivals vary between 1 and 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory (phantom in-transit) as of P20: 545 units (P1: 81, P3: 158, P4: 132, P10: 174). Seasonal demand regime for Summer is sustained at ~200 units/week (last 9 periods avg: 197).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 1st, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has stabilized in a high-summer regime, with an average of approximately 190-200 units per period over the last 9 weeks. Inventory is currently 0, with 1,194 units recorded as 'in-transit'. However, historical analysis proves that 545 units (from P1, P3, P4, and P10) are definitively lost or permanently stalled, creating 'phantom' in-transit inventory. To compensate for this, I must set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters higher to force the OR engine to order despite this phantom pipeline. Recent lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 2 periods (P12 order arrived in 2, P16 order arrived in 1). I will set L to 1 to account for recent fast arrivals while maintaining a high mu_hat. mu_hat is set to 200 (current weekly avg) * (1 + 1) = 400 plus an additional 300 unit buffer to offset the 545 units of phantom inventory the OR engine thinks we have, aiming to trigger a replenishing order immediately.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22 (2019-07-08), we are in the peak summer retail season for the 'Nora T-shirt'. Demand has averaged 182 units over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), with a recent dip to 104 in P21. The supply chain remains highly unstable: we have 1194 units listed as 'In-transit', but history confirms 545 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10) are lost. Furthermore, orders from P19 (498 units) and P20 (151 units) are now expected to arrive, as P19 is at L=3 (exceeding promised L=2). Given the 0 on-hand inventory and the pattern of frequent total stockouts followed by single-period availability, the priority is to maintain a base stock that accounts for both the high summer demand (~200 units/week) and the high probability of shipment failure. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*200 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent high volatility (std dev of ~35-40), setting it at 75 to provide a safety buffer against lead-time variability. L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the successful delivery times (mostly 1-2 periods), while I manually adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to compensate for the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline that the OR engine incorrectly counts.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 15, 2019. Demand for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts has entered a late-summer cooling phase. The high-seasonal peak (approx. 200 units/week) observed from Period 12 to 20 has shifted downward, with the last three periods (P20-22) recording 190, 104, and 79 units respectively. The average for the last 5 periods (P18-22) is approximately 141 units. Regarding supply, the 'In-transit' figure of 1043 is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10 totaling 545 units) and a very large order from P19 (498 units) that is now overdue (expected P21 conclude). Given the drop in demand, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (141 * 3 = 423) and sigma_hat to reflect the cooling trend. I am setting L to 3 explicitly to account for the ongoing supply instability and ensure the OR backend generates cover for the delay in the P19 shipment while acknowledging the demand softening.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed starting P21: 5-period average dropped from ~200 to ~141 (-30%). Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 545 units; an additional 498 units from P19 are now overdue (ordered P19, expected P21).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 24 (late July). Historical data shows a clear seasonal cooling for this basic t-shirt SKU; demand has dropped from a peak of ~200 units/week to a recent 3-period average of ~90 units (104, 79, 88). There is a critical supply chain issue: total 'In-transit' inventory is 1043 units, but 545 units (from P1, P3, P4, P10) are confirmed lost and 498 units (from P19) are significantly overdue (expected P21, currently P24) and likely lost as well. This means 1043 units are 'phantom' in-transit inventory. To signal the OR backend to place a new order despite this fake pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome (phantom in-transit + target stock). Since the actual demand is ~90, and I need to clear ~1000 units of phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the true demand (90 * (1+L)) plus the total lost units to force an order that covers the immediate stockout. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as recent successful deliveries (P16, P20) arrived in 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 24, total phantom in-transit inventory is confirmed at 1043 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19). Period 19 (498 units) is 3 periods overdue. Current demand regime has stabilized at a lower level of ~90 units/week (last 3 periods) following the summer peak.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' has entered a significant cooling phase following the summer peak. The last four periods show demand of 104, 79, 88, and 61, establishing a new regime around 83 units/week. This is a sharp decline from the previous ~200 units/week plateau. Supply chain reliability remains a major issue. Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory is now 1043 units (confirmed losses: P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). The pipeline inventory shown by the system (1394) is composed of 1043 phantom units and 351 real units (ordered P24). With on-hand inventory at 0 and the P24 order expected to arrive in P26 (L=2), the focus is on maintaining the new lower demand level. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current cooling trend (~83 units/period) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility at lower demand levels. L is set to 'calculate' to utilize valid arrivals (P2, P9, P12, P16, P20) while accounting for general lead time behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: 4-period average (P21-P24) is 83 units/week, down ~60% from the summer peak. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1043 units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26 (August 5, 2019), the Nora T-shirt is experiencing a clear post-summer cooling phase. Demand over the last five weeks has dropped significantly from the summer peak of ~200 to an average of ~75 units/period (P21-P25: 104, 79, 88, 61, 44). The current 'In-transit' figure of 1394 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19 total 1043 units). Additionally, the P24 order (351 units) is still in transit with an expected lead time of 2 periods. Accounting for the 1043 phantom units, the 'real' pipeline is roughly 351 units. Given the declining demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the cooling period) to avoid excessive overstocking as we exit the peak season. High sigma_hat with recent_N=5 is used to capture the volatility during this downward transition.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/phantom in-transit inventory as of P26: 1043 units (P1: 81, P3: 158, P4: 132, P10: 174, P19: 498). Current demand regime (P21-P25) reflects a late-summer/autumn decline, averaging ~75 units/week.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Womens Everyday Basics' Nora T-shirt is in a clear post-summer cooling phase. The average demand over the last six periods (P21-P26) is approximately 73.7 units, showing stabilization at a lower regime compared to the summer peak of ~200. Regarding inventory, we have a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory issue. As documented in the carry-over insights, orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, and now P19 (1043 units total) are essentially lost. Current In-transit is reported as 1394, which includes the P19 (498 units), P20 (received P22), and P24 (351 units) orders. Specifically, 1394 (total in-transit) - 351 (viable P24 order) = 1043 phantom units. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must treat the lead time as 'explicit' to account for current delays and use 'explicit' mu_hat to ignore the phantom 1043 units that the OR engine thinks are coming. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand at the current regime (~74 units/week). With L=2, base stock should be ~222 plus safety stock. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory (1394 units) from the calculated base stock, I must set 'mu_hat' high enough to overcome the 1043 units of dead weight plus the desired order quantity (around 220 units to refill for the next cycle). Total mu_hat target = 1043 (phantom) + 220 (actual needs) = 1263.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/phantom in-transit inventory remains 1043 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Demand regime (P21-P26) stabilized at ~74 units/week, marking a seasonal shift to autumn levels.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' continues to trend downward as the summer season ends. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P21-P27) is approximately 70 units per week. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower autumn baseline. Regarding supply, the 'in-transit' inventory of 1394 units is heavily inflated by 1043 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19). Additionally, the P24 order (351 units) is now at its promised lead time (3 periods since order phase) and has not yet arrived (it should appear in P28 conclude). The OR backend's cap mechanism (min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)) is currently being paralyzed by this massive phantom 'in-transit' figure, as the pipeline inventory (1394) far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 70-unit demand regime. To bypass this and ensure the backend actually places an order, I am setting L to 1 (recent experienced lead time for successful deliveries) and intentionally over-forecasting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 420 units (representing a roughly 2x buffer over (1+L)*70). This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to potentially overcome the phantom inventory subtraction and trigger a shipment to maintain stock for the next few weeks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '554598057' is a Jersey T-shirt, which has moved past its summer peak and is now in a clear autumn cooling phase. Recent demand (P24-P28) shows a stabilized regime at approximately 52 units per week (61, 44, 66, 50, 39). Total in-transit inventory is 1394 units, but a large portion is confirmed lost or 'phantom' from historical supply failures. Confirmed lost shipments include P1 (81), P3 (158), P4 (132), P10 (174), and P19 (498), totaling 1043 units. This leaves 351 units (ordered P24) as potentially valid in-transit inventory. Since the P24 order is now 4 periods old (ordered July 22, current date Aug 26) and the promised lead time is 2, this shipment is also likely lost or severely delayed. Relying on these phantom units results in perpetual stockouts. I will use 'explicit' values to bypass the OR engine's reliance on phantom in-transit data and the inflated historical mean. mu_hat is set to 156 (3 periods * 52 units) to cover demand during the review and lead period (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but generally short lead times for arrived shipments (1-2 periods), while acknowledging the high loss rate.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, total phantom in-transit inventory is 1394 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P24) as all current in-transit shipments are now significantly past their expected arrival dates. The autumn demand regime is stable at ~52 units/week (last 5 periods).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598057 is currently in an autumn demand cooling phase. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 43.4 units, representing a significant decline from the mid-summer peak of ~200. Supply chain analysis confirms that 1394 units currently listed as 'in-transit' (from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P24) are lost or indefinitely delayed, as they are all significantly past the 1-2 period lead time observed for successful deliveries (like P20 arriving in P22). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, these 1394 'phantom' units will prevent any new orders from being placed unless accounting is adjusted. To force the OR backend to place an order, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that exceeds the phantom in-transit amount plus current demand needs for the review period (L+1). Given the current demand of ~44 units and a lead time of 2, a base stock needs to cover ~132 units of real demand. Adding the 1394 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of ~1526 units to trigger a replenishment. I will use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current lower volatility of the autumn regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 29, total phantom in-transit inventory is 1394 units (confirmed loss of P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P24) due to shipments exceeding maximum observed lead times. Autumn demand regime (P25-P29) is stable at ~44 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' continues its seasonal decline as we enter September, with recent weekly demands dropping from ~50 units in early August to just 16 units in Period 30. The current demand regime (last 5 periods) averages 37.8 units/week. Supply chain issues remain severe: total confirmed phantom in-transit inventory is 1394 units (lost orders from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P24). The 'In-transit' figure of 1552 units includes these 1394 phantom units plus the 158 units ordered in Period 30. To ensure the OR backend orders appropriately, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this low-demand autumn floor. I will continue using the default lead time of 2 as recent successful arrivals (P20 arrival in P22) still align with this, while acknowledging that many shipments are simply lost rather than delayed.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand floor confirmed: last 5 periods (P26-P30) average 37.8 units/week. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1394 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) has effectively bottomed out as we transition into the autumn/winter season. The last 5 periods (P27-P31) have seen demand drop significantly: 50, 39, 18, 16, 3, averaging ~25 units/week, with the most recent week showing nearly zero demand. Supply chain stability remains extremely poor; a total of 1394 units are currently identified as 'phantom' in-transit (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P24). The order placed in Period 30 (158 units) is still within the lead-time window, though pending. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the collapse in demand, I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average (using N=5 to capture the seasonal floor) and sigma_hat similarly to reflect low volatility. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to incorporate observed arrival behavior while acknowledging the high loss rate. The goal is to avoid over-ordering into a low-demand season while accounting for the high probability that current in-transit figures are inflated by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand floor updated: demand has reached near-zero levels as of P31 (3 units), with a 5-period average (P27-P31) of 25.2 units/week. Total phantom in-transit inventory remains 1394 units.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering the late autumn/winter season, and demand has dropped significantly. The 5-period average (P28-P32) is approximately 16.6 units, while the most recent demand in P32 was only 7 units, following a low of 3 units in P31. There is a massive discrepancy between actual on-hand inventory (151 units) and the reported 'in-transit' inventory (1394 units). These in-transit units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, and 24, as they are all significantly beyond any reasonable lead time. Because the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order quantities (base_stock - pipeline), it will see 1545 units (151 oh + 1394 it) and refuse to order anything for several periods. Given the current demand floor (averaging ~16 units), the current on-hand inventory of 151 units is more than sufficient to cover at least 9 weeks of demand. Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this low-demand regime and use a recent N of 5 to capture the current autumn floor.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand floor established: last 5 periods (P28-P32) average 16.6 units/week. Current on-hand inventory (151 units) covers ~9 weeks of demand at this rate.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' (Womens Everyday Basics) has significantly dropped as we enter the autumn/winter season. The 5-period average demand (P29-P33) is now 13.2 units per week, which is a sharp contrast to the summer peak of ~200 units. Current on-hand inventory is 129 units, which, at the current demand rate, provides nearly 10 periods of coverage. The 'In-transit' figure of 1394 units is entirely composed of 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24), and thus should be ignored for logic purposes. Given the high stock-to-demand ratio and the seasonal decline, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (N=5) to prevent unnecessary ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining the promised lead time of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand floor remains low: 5-period average (P29-P33) is 13.2 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently excessive (9+ weeks of cover).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35 (2019-10-07), the demand for the Nora T-shirt has entered a significant seasonal low (Autumn/Winter). The last 5 periods (P30-P34) show demand values of 16, 3, 7, 22, and 9, resulting in an average of 11.4 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 120 units, which provides approximately 10.5 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1394 units is composed entirely of phantom inventory from historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24), and these should be disregarded as they will not arrive. Given the excessive on-hand inventory relative to the current low-demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand floor using the last 5 periods to ensure the OR engine doesn't trigger unnecessary replenishment. The lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 2, as recent successful deliveries (P30) arrived on time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom in-transit inventory total is 1394 units (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Autumn/Winter demand baseline is ~11 units/week (P30-P34).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Oct 14, 2019. The product (Womens Everyday Basics Jersey T-shirt) is in a significant seasonal decline as we move into autumn/winter. Demand has stabilized at a very low baseline, with a 5-period average (P31-P35) of approximately 9.2 units per week. There is a verified 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 1394 units comprising lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 10, 19, and 24. These units will never arrive and must be ignored by the OR logic. Currently, on-hand inventory is 114 units, which at the current demand rate covers over 12 periods of sales. Consequently, no new orders are required. The parameters are set to reflect this low-demand regime, using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current floor while effectively treating the phantom in-transit as non-existent to prevent the backend from under-ordering in the future, although the primary constraint now is reducing excess on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand floor remains stable and low: 5-period average (P31-P35) is 9.2 units/week. On-hand inventory (114) provides excessive coverage (>12 weeks) for the remainder of the game.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn/Winter demand floor, with demand averaging approximately 8.2 units over the last 5 periods (P32-P36: 7, 22, 9, 6, 8). The current on-hand inventory of 106 units provides approximately 12-13 periods of coverage at this consumption rate, which is more than enough to cover the remaining 11 periods of the game (up to P47). There are 1394 units of 'in-transit' inventory identified as phantom/lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24), and these likely will never arrive. Given the excessive on-hand stock relative to the low seasonal demand, the priority is to avoid further holding costs. I will set parameters to ensure no new orders are triggered, as the existing stock is sufficient to satisfy all remaining demand without replenishment.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a low-demand autumn/winter regime, with the last 5 periods (P33-P37) averaging approximately 9.6 units per week. The current on-hand inventory of 103 units is sufficient to cover approximately 10.7 weeks of demand at this rate. Given that the game ends in Period 47 (10 weeks remaining), current inventory is already slightly more than what is needed for the remainder of the simulation, especially since demand has stabilized at a very low floor. Stocking more would only lead to unnecessary holding costs. The in-transit inventory of 1394 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24) which the OR backend might incorrectly count as pending supply; however, the cap mechanism and current high on-hand levels will naturally prevent additional ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the contemporary low-demand environment and minimize further costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 4, 2019 (Period 39 out of 47). The product is a jersey t-shirt, currently in a low-demand late autumn/winter seasonal trough. Demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has averaged 6.8 units/week, with the most recent demand being 8 units. On-hand inventory is 95 units, which provides approximately 14 weeks of coverage at the current demand rate\u2014exceeding the remaining 9 periods of the game. Significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory (1394 units) remains in the system due to historically lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders and incurring unnecessary holding costs on an already overstocked item, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime using the most recent 5 samples (N=5). Given that on-hand (95) > pipeline expectation (~21 units for 3 weeks), no new orders will be generated.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40 (2019-11-11), the demand for the 'Nora T-shirt' remains in its low-season winter floor. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 6.4 units per week. The current on-hand inventory of 88 units provides over 13 weeks of coverage at the current consumption rate, while there are only 7 periods remaining in the game. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1394 units consists entirely of confirmed lost/phantom shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24) and does not represent actual incoming stock. Given that on-hand inventory already exceeds the total expected demand for the remainder of the game, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period regime to reflect the low demand floor, which will prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders. This strategy minimizes additional holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 554598057 (Nora T-shirt) is currently in a low-demand late-autumn/winter period, with demand averaging approximately 6.6 units per week over the last five periods (P36-P40). On-hand inventory is 81 units, which at the current depletion rate provides over 12 weeks of coverage. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1394 units consists entirely of 'phantom stock' from shipments confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24). Since we are at Period 41 of 47 and have significant surplus relative to the remaining horizon, no new orders are required. Parameters are set to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid unnecessary ordering while accounting for the high on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Winter demand floor remains stable at ~7 units/week (last 5 periods avg: 6.6). On-hand inventory (81) is sufficient to cover all remaining demand for the game duration (6 periods left).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is in a stable low-demand Autumn/Winter regime, with an average demand of approximately 7 units per week over the last 6 periods (P36-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 73 units, and with only 6 periods remaining in the game (P42-P47), the total expected demand is roughly 42-50 units. Therefore, the existing inventory is more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs. I will set the parameters to reflect this low-demand state and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation does not trigger further orders by keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned with recent low volatility and low volume.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-12-02 (Period 43) with 4 periods remaining in the game. The product is a jersey t-shirt, and demand has entered a stable, low winter regime. Over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 9.0 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 58 units. Given the remaining 4 periods and a projected demand of ~9 units/period, the total expected demand for the rest of the game is approximately 36 units. The existing 58 units on-hand are sufficient to satisfy this demand without further ordering. The 1394 units 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory from lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24) and do not represent usable stock. I will maintain L at default and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation does not trigger unnecessary orders, especially since holding costs ($1/unit) would significantly outweigh the risk of stockouts at these demand levels.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44 (Dec 9, 2019) with only 4 periods remaining in the game (ending P47). Current demand is in a sustained low-seasonal floor for 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirts. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 7.8 units, and over the last 10 periods is 7.1 units. On-hand inventory is 56 units. With a total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods likely not exceeding 32-40 units (based on recent averages), the current on-hand stock is sufficient to satisfy all remaining demand without further ordering. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1394 units consists entirely of historical phantom shipments (P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, P24) as documented in Carry-over insights, which would otherwise suppress ordering, but since no more stock is required anyway, this is moot. I will maintain default L and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand stability.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 of 47, specifically December 16, 2019. The product is a jersey t-shirt, currently in a low-demand winter baseline. Reviewing recent history, demand for the last five periods (P40-P44) has been minimal (7, 8, 15, 2, 5), averaging 7.4 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P45, P46, P47), the current on-hand inventory of 51 units is significantly more than sufficient to meet all remaining demand (estimated at ~22 units total based on the current average). The in-transit inventory of 1394 units consists entirely of shipments from P1, P3, P4, P10, P19, and P24, which are now months overdue and confirmed as lost 'phantom' inventory in carry-over insights. To prevent incurring unnecessary holding costs on existing stock or triggering new orders that would arrive too late and result in ending inventory penalties, I will set parameters to ensure zero further ordering. mu_hat will be set to a low explicit value based on the current 3-week horizon, and L will stay at the default promised lead time of 2.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 47, which is the penultimate period of the game. The product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' jersey t-shirt. Historical demand shows a clear seasonal cycle: a massive peak during the Spring and Summer (up to ~200 units/week) and a significant decline to a winter floor starting around Period 30. The last 5 periods (P41-P45) have seen very low demand, averaging 7.2 units/week (8, 15, 2, 5, 6). On-hand inventory is currently 45 units. Given that we only have two periods of demand remaining (Period 46 and Period 47), the current on-hand inventory of 45 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~14-15 units total. Therefore, no new orders are required. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime, and keep L at default. The on-hand inventory already far exceeds the calculated base stock for this low-demand state.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 (December 30, 2019), the final decision period of the simulation. The inventory on-hand is 45 units. Recent demand has been extremely low, consistent with the Autumn/Winter floor identified in carry-over insights: the last 5 periods (P42-P46) averaged 5.6 units/week. Even with the drift toward zero in P46, the 45 units on-hand are more than sufficient to cover any demand for this final period. Placing an order now is counterproductive as it would arrive after the simulation ends and provide no benefit while incurring unnecessary risk or pipeline holding logic. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand floor, while the 1394 units of phantom in-transit inventory will naturally prevent the backend OR from placing a redundant order given the existing stock levels and the end-of-game context.
