Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS, a staple item (High-waisted superstretch jeans) in the Divided collection. Initial historical demand data (5 samples) shows an average of 688.8 units per week with an upward trend (from 694 to 774). Given the 'Promised Lead Time' of 2 periods, the base stock formula should consider demand across (L+1) = 3 periods to cover the first delivery cycle. Since there's no prior period 'conclude' message, we stick to the promised lead time and historical demand statistics to set the initial order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent samples including the slight uptick in February.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2 (2019-02-18). The product is a staple item (High-waisted skinny denim), and the historical demand over the last 6 weeks (including Period 1) shows a stable mean of approximately 686 units per week with a standard deviation of 66. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 because the order placed in Period 1 (808 units) is still in transit, as the promised lead time is 2 periods. This order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, we are experiencing stockouts (sold 0 against 671 demand in Period 1). Since there's no evidence of a demand regime shift or lead-time deviation yet, I will use 'recent_N' for both demand parameters using all 6 available samples (the 5 provided plus Period 1's actual demand) to provide a localized estimate. L is set to 'default' as we haven't completed a lead-time cycle yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand inventory is 0, with 1601 units in-transit. The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch high-waisted denim trouser. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks (Jan 7 to Feb 4) was [694, 576, 685, 715, 774], averaging ~689. Recent demand in P1 (671) and P2 (673) aligns closely with this historical mean. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (ordered 2019-02-11) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase; therefore, we expect to see 'arrived=808' in the P3 conclude message at the start of P4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand because arrivals haven't happened yet. Our goal is to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 periods of demand. Given the stability of the demand (mean ~685-690), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (5 historical + 2 game periods) to capture the trend, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to use promised lead time and historical volatility.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS) had an initial on-hand inventory of 0, and since promised lead time is 2, arrivals from Period 1 (ordered on Feb 11) are expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates the actual lead time is likely longer than the promised 2 periods, or there is a delay. Looking at historical data (Jan-Feb), demand ranges from 576 to 774. The recent periods (P1: 671, P2: 673, P3: 539) show a slight softening but remain within the historical variance. Because we have 0 on-hand and 2222 in-transit (P1+P2+P3 orders), we must maintain a steady base stock. I will assume a lead time of 3 periods (L=3) because the P1 order (L=2) hasn't arrived by the end of P3. For demand, the average of all available samples (5 historical + 3 game periods) is ~666. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the slight recent dip while maintaining sufficient stock for the (L+1) window.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5 (2019-03-11). Looking at the history, the product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a super-skinny high-waisted jean. Historical demand from the provided sample was ranging between 576-774 units. Recent demand (Periods 1-4) has been 671, 673, 539, and 447. There appears to be a declining trend since mid-February. Regarding lead time, the Period 2 order (793 units) arrived in Period 4, confirming a lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, the Period 1 order (808 units) has NOT arrived as of the end of Period 4 (it should have arrived in Period 3 if lead time was 2). This suggests the Period 1 shipment is likely lost or significantly delayed. Combined on-hand (346) and in-transit (1971) totals 2317 units. Given the recent demand drop (average of last 3 periods is 553), we need to adjust our forecast. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the downward trend while setting L to 'calculate' to incorporate the confirmed lead time data while acknowledging the missing shipment risk.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (2019/3/18). Looking at the history: Period 1's order (808 units) appears to be lost as it has not arrived by Period 5 (promised lead time 2). Period 2's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time 2). Period 3's order was expected in Period 5 but did not arrive, and we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with unmet demand in Period 5. The demand trend is decreasing from ~700 in early Feb to ~450 in March. I need to stabilize the inventory position. Since the backend OR engine calculates orders based on (base_stock - pipeline), and we have a large 'In-transit' quantity (1971 units), if I use the 'default' lead time of 2, the pipeline might prevent necessary ordering if it includes the likely lost Period 1 and delayed Period 3 shipments. However, since the prompt states 'Lost orders remain in In-transit indefinitely', but the OR engine doesn't know they are lost, I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the observed delay/instability and use a 'recent_N' of 3 for demand to capture the lower March levels (~485 average). This helps the backend adjust the base stock higher to account for longer lead times while acknowledging the recent volume drop.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). The product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', a superstretch denim item. Looking at the history, an order from Period 1 (808 units) appears to be lost. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Only one order (from Period 2) has successfully arrived (at Period 4), confirming a 2-period lead time for that specific shipment. However, the absence of the Period 1 order (now 6 periods since ordering) and the Period 3 order (now 4 periods since ordering) suggests high supply chain instability or lost shipments. Total in-transit is 2098, which includes these likely lost units and more recent orders. On-hand is currently 0, causing stockouts. Demand shows a downward trend: early samples were ~700, dropping to ~450-500 in March. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this lower March level. Since one shipment was confirmed at L=2, I will keep L as 'default' (2), but provide a slightly higher sigma_hat using recent_N to account for the volatility caused by the missing shipments and demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 1 (808 units) and potentially Period 3 (621 units) appear lost or significantly delayed; demand regime shifted from ~700 in Jan/Feb to ~490 in March (-30%).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019/04/01). On-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 4, decreasing from a ~700 average to a ~490 average (N=4: 447, 468, 502, 511). Profit is $19 and Holding is $1, leading to a high target service level (q = 0.95), implying the OR backend will target a high base stock. Regarding lead times: the Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time (L=2). However, the Period 1 order (808 units) is now 5 periods overdue and the Period 3 order (621 units) is 3 periods overdue; both are likely lost or permanently delayed. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime. For L, I will use 'explicit' value 2 because the one successful arrival confirmed the promised lead time, while the missing units should be treated as lost pipeline (which the OR backend will eventually adjust for if they don't arrive). Setting L to the promised lead time ensures we don't over-order based on outliers, while mu_hat reflects current traffic.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~480-500 units per week since Period 4 (2019-03-04); Period 1 and Period 3 orders (approx 1430 units combined) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9 (2019-04-08). Reviewing history, the promised lead time L=2 is generally accurate for orders that arrive (P2 arrived P4, P6 arrived P8). However, the orders from P1 (808 units) and P3 (621 units) are confirmed lost as they are far past their expected window. Current inventory on-hand is 0. Pipelines show 1971 units in-transit, but 1429 of those (P1+P3) are lost, meaning the 'active' pipeline is actually 542 units (from P4). Since P4 was ordered on 2019-03-04 with L=2, it should have arrived in P6. The fact it hasn't arrived by P8 suggests a delay OR loss. The P6 order arrived on time (P8). This inconsistency suggests volatility in the supply chain or that P4 is also lost. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime: P4 to P8 demand was [447, 468, 502, 511, 560], averaging ~498. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this lower but slightly increasing demand trend. I will keep L=2 (default) as the functioning lead time for successful deliveries, but I must manually account for the lost stock in the pipeline to trigger a fresh order (the OR backend sees 1971 in-transit and won't order if I don't adjust). To force an order to replenish the lost P1 and P3 stock, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value calculated as: (1+L) * Mean_Demand + (Lost_Units). Mean_Demand = 500, L=2, (3*500) + 1429 = 2929. This will signal to the backend that current inventory/pipeline is insufficient.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 15, 2019. We are in a lower demand regime for these high-waisted jeans compared to early February, with average demand since Period 4 stabilizing around 470 units. Orders from Period 1 (808 units) and Period 3 (621 units) are confirmed lost as they are significantly past the promised 2-period lead time. However, Period 2 and Period 6 orders arrived exactly on time (L=2). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 3019 units in-transit (this includes the lost 1429 units plus valid orders from Period 4, 9, and potentially this period). We must set parameters to account for the actual demand (~470/week) and the typical 2-period lead time, while acknowledging that despite a large 'pipeline', roughly 1429 units are phantom inventory that will never arrive. To compensate for the backend's tendency to subtract pipeline inventory from the base stock, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift demand average (~470 * 3 = 1410) and 'calculate' for L. The high in-transit value (including lost units) will likely cause the OR engine to order 0, but by stabilizing the demand forecast, we ensure that as soon as the valid pipeline clears or is replaced, we resume proper replenishment.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 22, 2019. The product is a seasonal denim item (High-waisted skinny jeans). Demand analysis shows a significant downward shift: early samples (Jan-Feb) averaged ~680, then dropped to ~480-510 in March, and the most recent two periods (9 and 10) have plummeted to 335 and 269 respectively. This suggests the spring peak has passed or interest is waning. For mu_hat, I will use a short window (recent_N=3) to capture this rapid decline while still providing coverage. Lead time is volatile: Period 9 arrived in 1 period, but Period 2/6 arrived in 2 periods, and Period 1/3 were lost. I will set L to 2 to be conservative given the history of stockouts and lost shipments. On-hand inventory is 779, which covers approx. 2-3 weeks of current demand, allowing for a smaller order to align with the lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9 (2019-04-08): Average dropped from ~490 to ~300 (-38%), indicating seasonal decline for high-waisted denim jeans; Lead time remains inconsistent with a mix of 1-period, 2-period, and lost shipments.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a high-waisted denim skinny jean. We have identified a significant demand regime shift that began in early April (Period 9). Historical demand from the last three periods (Period 9-11) has dropped to an average of approximately 288 units (335, 269, 261), compared to the ~490 units seen in March. This likely reflects a seasonal transition away from this specific denim style. Our current on-hand inventory is 518 units, which covers nearly two periods of demand at the new lower rate. However, the 'in-transit' total of 1971 includes several lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (specifically Period 1: 808 units and Period 3: 621 units) which the OR backend still counts toward pipeline inventory. To ensure the backend doesn't suppress new orders due to these 'ghost' units, and to adjust to the new lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus on the ~288 unit/week average. I am using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat as well to capture the current lower volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the mix of 1-period and 2-period arrivals observed recently.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed for April/May: average demand has stabilized at ~288 units per period, down from ~490 in March.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-06 (Period 13). The demand for high-waisted skinny denim has clearly stabilized into a lower-demand seasonal regime since Period 9 (2019-04-08). Over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), demand values were 335, 269, 261, and 339, yielding an average of 301 units. This confirms the 'Period 12' carry-over insight of ~288-300 units per period. Regarding supply, we have 179 units on-hand and 1971 units in-transit. The in-transit total is misleadingly high because it includes the confirmed lost shipments from Period 1 (808 units) and Period 3 (621 units), totaling 1429 units. Subtracting these lost units from the in-transit balance (1971 - 1429) leaves an effective pipeline of 542 units (ordered in Period 4). The lead time for 'concluded' orders has fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. To ensure we don't over-order against phantom inventory while accounting for the lower seasonal demand, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=4) to capture the current 301-unit average and set the lead time to the promised 2 periods to maintain safety stock levels. The OR backend will see the lower mu_hat and place a sized order if the effective pipeline + on-hand is insufficient, though the 1429 units of 'lost' inventory still present in the system's pipeline view may prevent a new order unless mu_hat/sigma_hat are high enough or 'L' is adjusted; however, with high-waisted denim entering May, a conservative stance on new ordering is preferred to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/5/13. The product is a high-waisted denim skinny jean, which has transitioned from a high-demand period (Jan-Mar: ~500-700 units) to a lower demand regime (Apr-May: ~290 units). Period 13 demand was 241, consistent with the recent regime starting at Period 9 (2019/4/08) where the average is approx 289 units. On-hand inventory is 0, following the exhaustion of the Period 9 shipment. There is an in-transit pipeline of 1971 units; however, 1429 of these units (orders from P1 and P3) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed based on carry-over insights. The remaining 542 units ordered in Period 4 are also long overdue (10 weeks) and likely lost. The OR backend needs to place an order to replenish stock, but it sees the 'In-transit' figure of 1971. Because the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)), the inflated pipeline will prevent it from ordering. To force an order, I will set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the (L+1) demand coverage AND offsets the ghost pipeline (approx 1971 units). Calculation: Base Stock needed = (1+L)*demand + safety stock. With L=2, avg demand=289, and z*sigma approx 150, Base Stock ~ 1017. To offset 1971 phantom units, I would need a mu_hat > 2500. However, the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend (cap = mu_hat/3 + z*sigma/sqrt(3)) will limit the order. I will use 'explicit' values to maximize the replenishment order to return to the new 289-unit demand level while acknowledging the lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-20. The product is a high-waisted denim skinny jeans, which has seen a sustained demand decline as we move into late spring. Historically, demand was ~700 in Jan/Feb, ~490 in March, and has stabilized at ~280 units since April (recent 6-period mean \u2248 272). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is high (2979 units), though this includes ~1429 units from Periods 1 and 3 that are confirmed lost. The remaining active pipeline (from P14) is 1008 units. Lead times have been inconsistent: P2 (2), P6 (2), and P9 (1), while P1 and P3 never arrived. Given the recent stabilization of demand at a lower regime, I am using recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to incorporate the observed historical performance while the OR backend's safety stock logic (z-score) handles the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Average demand from Period 9 to Period 14 is 272 units, confirming the seasonal transition to a lower baseline for this denim SKU.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-05-27 (Period 16). The product is a high-waisted denim jean, which has transitioned from a high-demand Q1 (Jan/Feb/Mar) to a significantly lower demand regime in late Q2 (April/May/June). Demand over the last 7 periods (P9-P15) has averaged 287 units, but the most recent period saw a spike to 375. Despite this, the overall trend is much lower than the early-year peaks. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 2979 units 'In-transit'. This pipeline inventory comprises orders from P1 (808 - lost), P3 (621 - lost), P4 (542 - 11 periods overdue, likely lost), and P14 (1008 - expected in P16/P17). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline from the base stock calculation, the presence of these 'lost' units (approximately 1971 units) is preventing the system from ordering. To mitigate this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a 2-period lead time as (L+1) * forecasted demand = 3 * 287 = 861. Adding a safety margin due to recent volatility, I set mu_hat (the review+lead time demand) to a value that, when combined with the large pipeline, will either suppress unnecessary orders or allow for replacement if the pipeline is actually cleared. However, since the pipeline size (2979) significantly exceeds my base stock needs (~900-1100), the system will not order until the backend pipeline inventory is reduced or the lost units are removed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand tracking to capture the May regime accurately.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 3rd, 2019. Demand for these high-waisted skinny jeans has spiked significantly in the last two weeks (375 and 533 units), deviating from the lower April/May baseline of ~272 units. This suggests a post-spring or early summer surge. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1008 units ordered in Period 14 (3 periods ago) still in transit. Given the 'in-transit' total is 2979, this includes the Period 14 order and the historical lost/indefinitely delayed units from Periods 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. (approximately 1971 units). I will treat the Period 14 shipment as delayed or arriving shortly. To respond to the demand spike, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the sudden upward trend. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to account for increased volatility. Lead time L is kept at 2 (promised) as the most recent successful shipment (P9) actually arrived in 1 period, but the current P14 shipment is already at L=3, so the backend's default or calculate methods might be skewed by the lost units in the 'in-transit' bucket.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 15: Weekly demand increased from ~270 to over 450 (avg of P15-P16 is 454), suggesting a summer seasonal spike for high-waisted denim. Period 14 order (1008 units) is currently delayed (3 periods since order vs promised 2).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/06/10. Retail context indicates a summer seasonal spike for denim (Jade HW Skinny Denim). Demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has averaged 453 units (375, 533, 451), confirming a regime shift from the April/May average of ~280. Supply chain reliability is low: the order from Period 14 (1008 units) is now 3 periods overdue (ordered May 13th, expected May 27th), and P1/P3 orders were previously lost. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost significant sales. To compensate for the erratic lead times and the missing P14 shipment, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current summer demand spike (+60% vs the previous regime). Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect the high volatility seen in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Summer seasonal spike confirmed: Average demand increased from ~270 to ~453 (+67%) starting P15 (2019-05-20). Shipment from P14 (1008 units) is confirmed delayed (3 periods passed without arrival).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is June 17, 2019. We are in the middle of a summer seasonal demand spike for Jade HW Skinny Denim, which began around P15 (May 20). Average demand over the last 4 periods (P15-P18) is approximately 455 units (375, 533, 451, 462), which is a significant increase from the April/May average of ~270. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory is 2979 units, but this includes potentially lost or heavily delayed shipments. Specifically, the order from P14 (1008 units) is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P14, current P19 START, promised L=2, expected arrival P16), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed like the P1 and P3 orders. However, orders from P17 and P18 are still within a reasonable window. To manage the current spike and the risk of stockouts given the zero on-hand balance, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture the higher summer demand regime. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to incorporate historical variance, though I remain cautious about the reliability of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Summer demand spike confirmed at Period 19: Average demand for P15-P18 is 455 units, compared to the previous regime of ~270. Order from P14 (1008 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost or severely delayed.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (2019/06/24), the SKU is in a sustained summer demand spike. For Periods 15\u201319, weekly demand has averaged 435.8 units (375, 533, 451, 462, 358), significantly higher than the April/May baseline of ~270. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'in-transit' total of 2979 units is misleading because it includes several lost or indefinitely delayed shipments: P1 (808 units, now 19 periods old), P3 (621 units, now 17 periods old), and P14 (1008 units, now 6 periods old). The backend OR logic subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the base stock. If I don't adjust the parameters, the backend will think there is sufficient stock in transit and order 0, leading to continued stockouts. To force an order that accounts for the lost P1, P3, and P14 shipments (totaling 2437 units), I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. My target base stock calculation: Expected demand for L+1 periods (3 * 436 = 1308) + safety stock (approx 250) + accounting for the 2437 lost units \u2248 4000. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher volatility of the summer regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P15 (Summer spike) avg approx 436 units/period confirmed through P19; Shipment from P14 (1008 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost along with P1 and P3 orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/01. Demand analysis shows the 'Summer seasonal spike' which started at Period 15 (avg ~454) has cooled down in the last two periods (P19: 358, P20: 265), with P20 demand dropping significantly. This suggests the summer peak may be ending or fluctuating. In terms of lead time, orders from Period 1, 3, and 14 (totaling 2437 units) are confirmed lost/delayed indefinitely. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 4203 units in-transit (reflecting the lost units plus the large orders placed recently in P20). Since 'In-transit' includes lost units that never arrived, the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' will be inflated, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method for the last 6 periods (P15-P20, covers the summer period) which averages ~407 units. However, I must account for the lost stock. Since there are 2437 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force the OR backend to recognize a higher base stock level, effectively 'punching through' the phantom inventory cap to resume replenishment. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the variability in actual arrivals (1 to 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: The summer spike (avg ~450) observed from P15-P19 has dropped to 265 in P20, potentially signaling the end of the seasonal peak for this SKU.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22 (2019/07/08), the SKU is entering July. Following the summer demand spike (P15-P19, avg ~436), demand in P20 and P21 has dropped to 265 and 353 respectively (avg ~309). This suggests the peak has passed, returning to a baseline similar to the April/May regime (~270-300). I am designating the new demand regime starting at Period 20, setting N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this immediate shift while remaining responsive. For lead time, historical performance shows significant volatility including lost orders (P1, P3, P14) and inconsistent arrivals (1 to 2 periods). Because of the high volume of lost shipments (~3000+ units total), I will use 'explicit' lead time L=2 (promised) but set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent data to avoid over-ordering into a pipeline that might not arrive, while ensuring we cover the current lower demand level. Pipeline inventory is currently extremely high (4203) due to large orders in P1, P3, P14, and P20; since OR backend caps orders based on (base_stock - pipeline), it is unlikely to order more until these ghost units or actual units are reconciled.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: Post-summer spike, demand has settled to an average of ~309 (P20: 265, P21: 353), down from the ~436 average during the P15-P19 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6636.00

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/07/15. Analysis of the recent demand (P20-P22) shows values of 265, 353, and 393, averaging 337. This confirms the previously identified regime shift away from the summer peak (~450) and suggests a stabilization around the 300-340 range. I will set N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this most recent baseline (P20-P22). Regarding lead time, the Period 20 order arrived in Period 22 (LT=2), matching the promised lead time. However, Period 14 (1008 units) is clearly lost as it is now 8 periods overdue. Inventory on-hand (831) and in-transit (2979) appear high, but 'in-transit' includes the lost P14 order. The OR backend uses on-hand + pipeline to calculate orders; by utilizing the 'calculate' method for lead time, it will factor in historical performance while I use 'recent_N' (N=3) for mu_hat to prevent over-ordering during this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 20 confirmed: average demand is ~337 (P20-P22), significantly lower than the P15-P19 summer peak (~436).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '706016001' (High-waisted denim jeans) is currently in a post-summer demand regime. Analysis of demand from Period 20 to Period 23 suggests a stable average of approximately 345 units per period (265, 353, 393, 369). This is a significant decrease from the summer peak (avg ~436) but higher than the April/May baseline. In terms of lead time, the last successful delivery from Period 20 arrived in Period 22 (lead time = 2), aligning with the promised lead time. The order from Period 14 (1008 units) is now 10 periods overdue and, consistent with previous long-term delays (P1, P3), is treated as lost. Consequently, the pipeline inventory is effectively 0 for the backend OR calculation. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this stable post-peak regime (P20-P23), totaling (1+2)*345 = 1035 for the review+lead window. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 4 periods to reflect current volatility. L is set to default as the most recent arrival confirmed the 2-period promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime confirmed starting Period 20: demand average has stabilized at ~345 units per period (P20-P23), down from the ~436 summer peak; Shipment from Period 14 (1008 units) is confirmed lost alongside P1 and P3 orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is July 29, 2019. Historical data confirms that demand for high-waisted denim (706016001) underwent a summer spike (Periods 15-19, avg ~436) and has since stabilized into a post-summer regime starting at Period 20. For the last five periods (P20-P24), demand has been 265, 353, 393, 369, and 232, resulting in an average of 322.4 units per period. The shipment from Period 14 (1008 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 10 periods past its order date. On-hand inventory is 230 units, and there are no valid orders currently in the pipeline expected to arrive (the 2979 units in-transit includes confirmed lost orders from P1, P3, and P14 which total 2437 units, plus some other noise, but no recent orders are pending). Therefore, I need to set parameters to trigger a new order to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the post-summer demand average (~322) and volatility accurately (std ~66). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to use the observed average of successful deliveries (mostly 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime for 706016001 (Period 20-24) is confirmed at an average of 322 units per period, showing a significant drop from the summer peak of ~436.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-05. The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0). We are in a post-summer demand regime that started around Period 20. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P20-P25) is approximately 318 units per week (265, 353, 393, 369, 232, 298), which is higher than the April/May baseline (~270) but significantly lower than the June summer peak (~436). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, arrivals have been inconsistent (some 2-period, one 1-period, several lost). Orders from P1, P3, and P14 (totaling 2437 units) are confirmed lost, as they are many periods past their promised arrival. Total in-transit is 2979, but after subtracting the 2437 lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is 542 units (mostly from an order placed in P4 that hasn't arrived/concluded correctly or other untracked system noise). However, looking at the history 'ordered' column, the only outstanding valid order is from P20 (1224 units) which arrived in P22. Since there are no orders placed between P21 and P25, and on-hand is 0, the backend needs an order. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~318). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time for known arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Post-summer demand regime (P20-P25) stabilized at an average of ~318 units per period, consistently lower than the P15-P19 peak (~436).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019-08-12. Analysis of the post-summer demand regime (starting Period 20) shows a stabilized average demand of approximately 329 units per period (averaging demand from Period 20 to 26: 265, 353, 393, 369, 232, 298, 381). There are no upcoming major retail holidays in mid-August that would suggest a significant spike for denim before the back-to-school season fully kicks in later. Regarding supply tracking, orders from Periods 1, 3, and 14 are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' quantity of 2979 units likely includes these ghost orders plus the target stock. However, since On-hand is currently 0 and the backend's capped policy factors in pipeline inventory, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current regime to allow the system to replenish if it perceives a gap. I'm using N=7 for recent demand to capture the full stability of the post-summer shift (Period 20 onwards). Lead time remains at the default promised 2 periods as recent successful deliveries (P9, P20) arrived in 1-2 periods.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is 2019/8/19. Analysis of recent demand (Period 22-27) shows values of 393, 369, 232, 298, 381, 493. The demand has been volatile but generally increasing over the last two periods, moving from an average of ~318 to an average of ~437 in P26-P27. This could indicate a late-summer/back-to-school spike for high-waisted denim. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline inventory is 2979 units, which includes several confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P14) and the P20 order which arrived in P22. We must recalibrate for the new demand levels. I will use the last 8 samples (P20-P27) to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the post-summer trend and recent upswing. Lead time (L) remains 2 periods, as confirmed by the P20 order arriving in P22.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand increase observed in Periods 26 and 27 (avg 437) compared to previous stable post-summer average (~318), potentially reflecting a back-to-school seasonal trend.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (High-waisted denim jeans) is currently entering a 'back-to-school' seasonal surge. Demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) has averaged 435 units (381, 493, 432), compared to the previous post-summer average of 322 units, representing a ~35% increase. The inventory position is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. While 'In-transit' shows 2979 units, my analysis of the history confirms that orders from Period 1 (808), Period 3 (621), and Period 14 (1008) are lost, totaling 2437 phantom units. The only valid pipeline shipment is the 542 units ordered in Period 4, which is also extremely late and likely lost, making the effective pipeline near zero until new orders are placed. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current demand spike of ~435 units/period. I will use 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals (P10, P22) have adhered closer to the promised 1-2 period lead time, despite historical losses. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this period of rising demand.

Carry-over insight: Back-to-school demand surge confirmed: P26-P28 average demand increased to 435 units (+35% vs previous regime).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is September 2nd, 2019. We are in a 'Back-to-School' demand surge that began around Period 26 (August 5th). The demand for the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 381, 493, 432, and 396, resulting in an average of approximately 426 units per period. This is a significant increase from the previous 'post-summer' baseline of ~318. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory is 2979 units, which reflects the total undelivered units from lost/delayed shipments (P1, P3, P14) and any more recent system-generated orders. Given the history of lost shipments (P1, P3, P14 totaling ~2437 units), much of this 'In-transit' figure is likely phantom stock. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to use the 1.7 average of successful deliveries (P9 @ 1, P2 @ 2, P6 @ 2, P20 @ 2). I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current back-to-school surge (~426 units), ensuring the OR engine orders enough to meet the 1+L period window.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering a significant high-demand phase, likely driven by 'back-to-school' and early autumn seasonality for high-waisted denim. Period 30 saw a sharp spike to 740 units, following a stabilized surge of ~435 units in late August. This suggests the regime has shifted again. I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) to capture the higher baseline (average ~488), though given the P30 jump, this might still be conservative. On-hand is 0 and pipeline inventory is 2979, but history shows multiple large orders (P1, P3, P14) were lost. To avoid the OR engine under-ordering due to a bloated (but non-existent) pipeline, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I estimate demand at 600 units/period for the next 3 weeks (L+1), totaling 1800. I set sigma_hat to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Significant spike to 740 units observed, following the back-to-school surge; average demand for P26-P30 is 488 units, a notable increase from the previous ~320 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (high-waisted skinny denim) is currently experiencing a significant demand surge consistent with a 'back-to-school' or 'early fall' seasonal trend. Demand spiked to 740 and 708 units in the two most recent periods (P30, P31), compared to an average of ~435 in the P26-P28 period. This represents a secondary surge after the late-August increase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 2979 units recorded as 'in-transit'. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, and P14 are confirmed lost; however, there are no recent 'conclude' messages for arrivals. The promised lead time is 2, and while recent deliveries (P10, P22) showed 1 and 2 periods, the massive in-transit balance (likely stemming from large recent system orders not shown in the immediate history) suggests we must align the OR parameters to capture the current high-demand regime. Using N=6 for mu_hat captures the transition from the ~435 level to the ~720 level, resulting in a robust base stock that accounts for the current seasonality while the OR backend manages the pipeline. L is set to default as recent successful arrivals tracked close to the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand surge confirmed starting Period 30: Demand jumped to average 724 units (P30-P31) from the previous back-to-school average of ~435 units (+66%).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 (high-waisted denim) has entered a second significant demand surge starting around Period 30 (September), likely reflecting a transition into autumnal fashion trends. Demand for the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 740, 708, and 707 respectively, shifting the average significantly higher than the previous 'back-to-school' surge of ~435 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture this higher regime. Lead time analysis shows consistency (when shipments aren't lost) at L=2, though there have been multiple historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P14). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a large pipeline of 2979 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, and my mu_hat/sigma_hat choices based on the most recent regime will help ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover this new peak.

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Secondary surge confirmed starting P30 (2019-09-02): Average demand has stabilized at ~718 units (P30-P32), a 65% increase over the previous back-to-school average of ~435.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is experiencing a massive demand spike. Starting at Period 30 (early September), demand surged from a 'back-to-school' average of ~435 to ~718 units (P30-P32). However, Period 33 (2019-09-23) shows a secondary dramatic jump to 1428 units. This likely represents a peak autumn/seasonal event or a major promotion. The average demand for the most recent regime (P30-P33) is now 896 units. The inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and although 2979 units are in-transit, the system has been out of stock for weeks, leading to massive lost sales. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to capture the 896 average, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for this significantly higher volume across the lead time. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). Using recent_N for sigma_hat will also allow the backend to adjust the safety stock for the increased volatility seen in the last 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant secondary demand surge starting Period 33: Demand jumped to 1428 units, bringing the P30-P33 average to 896 units (+100% vs previous back-to-school regime). Current on-hand is 0 with significant lost sales occurring.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is currently in a high-demand autumn/secondary surge phase. Demand in Period 33 peaked at 1428, but reverted to 748 in Period 34. The average demand for the last five periods (P30-P34) is 866.2 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. There is 3700 units in-transit (reflecting the order of 721 from P34 and a large pipeline built up to chase the surge). Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use historical performance, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the accelerated demand from the current seasonal surge (P30-P34), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the high volatility seen in this period (specifically the outlier in P33 and the drop in P34).

Carry-over insight: Autumn/Secondary demand surge (started P30) remains active but volatile: P30-P34 average is 866 units, with Period 33 showing a peak of 1428 and Period 34 returning to 748.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a high-demand autumn regime that started around Period 30. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P30-P35) is 822.8 units (740, 708, 707, 1428, 748, 606). However, recent periods (P34-P35) suggest a slight cooling from the extreme peak in P33 (1428). Given the highly seasonal nature of this product (denim) and the recent volatility, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current autumn trend while acknowledging the high variance. Lead time observations (when shipments arrive) generally cluster around the promised 2 periods, though we have experienced several lost shipments (P1, P3, P14). Since there is currently a significant in-transit amount (3700 units) from potentially very large recent orders not yet showing in the conclude history (orders from P34 and potentially others not listed in high detail), I will use 'calculate' for L to use all confirmed historical lead times, as the OR backend will use this L+1 to determine the base stock level required to cover future demand against the 3700 units in pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P30-P35) average is 823 units, significantly higher than the previous back-to-school regime (~435) and post-summer regime (~320). Period 33 exhibited an extreme outlier of 1428 units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an Autumn demand regime which started around Period 30 (2019-09-02). While demand peaked at 1428 in Period 33, the most recent three periods (P34-P36) show a stabilization at a lower but still high level (748, 606, 581), averaging 645 units. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the full Autumn shift (P30-P36) while smoothing the P33 outlier. The in-transit inventory is 3700 units, significantly exceeding the current base stock requirements, likely due to a large order placed in Period 35 or 36 (not yet reflected in 'conclude' but visible in 'In-transit'). With 0 on-hand and high in-transit, no new orders are expected from the OR backend. Lead time has been 2 periods for the last successful arrival (P22); I will stick to 'default' promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P30-P36) shows stabilization after an initial spike; the average for the most recent three periods (P34-P36) is 645 units, suggesting a tapering off from the peak of 1428.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is currently in an Autumn demand regime that started around Period 30 (2019-09-02). While demand peaked significantly in Period 33 (1428 units), it has since stabilized at a lower, but still elevated level. For the last 4 periods (P34-P37), demand has averaged 644.5 units (748, 606, 581, 643). The overall average for the entire Autumn regime (P30-P37) is 769.9 units, but the recent 4-period window is more representative of the current tapering trend. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this stabilization near 645 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently 3700 units (from orders placed in P34 and presumably internal logic prior to my control), which comfortably covers several periods of demand at the current rate. I will maintain the lead time at the promised 2 periods (default) to monitor arrivals, as recent history shows significant disruptions and lost shipments (P1, P3, P14).

Carry-over insight: Autumn demand regime (P30-P37) shows stabilization with an average of 645 units over the last 4 periods, down from the earlier peak of 1428 units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 706016001 is currently in an Autumn demand regime (starting around Period 30). While demand peaked at 1428 in Period 33, it has since stabilized. The average demand over the last five periods (P34-P38) is 648.2 units. The game state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 3700 units in-transit. These in-transit units likely represent recent large orders intended to cover the Autumn surge observed in the carry-over insights. Since the promised lead time is 2, and the last order was placed in Period 34 (721 units), we are awaiting significant arrivals. An order in Period 34 with L=2 should arrive in Period 36 conclude (visible Period 37 START), but it hasn't appeared yet, suggesting a potential delay or that very large orders were placed prior to Period 34 that are not appearing in the explicit 'ordered' log but are reflected in the 'In-transit' balance. Given the current in-transit of 3700 units (approx. 5.7 weeks of supply at current demand) and the risk of holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5 for the stable Autumn tail) and default lead time to allow the OR engine to reconcile the pipeline against the base stock.

The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P34-P39) is approximately 621 units. However, looking at the very recent trend, demand has dropped below 500 for the first time in 10 weeks (P39: 485), which might signal the end of the autumn/early winter peak. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 3700 units in-transit. The order for 721 units from Period 34 is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, following the pattern of lost shipments in P1, P3, and P14. The 3700 units in-transit represent more recent aggressive ordering to recover from stockouts. To avoid over-ordering given the potential demand cool-down and the massive incoming pipeline, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 6 to capture the current 600-ish level, but the OR backend's cap mechanism will naturally modulate new orders against the 3700 units in-transit (excluding the lost P34 order). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to account for historical variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Shipment from Period 34 (721 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost, consistent with historical shipment failures. Demand regime shifted slightly downwards in Period 39 (485 units) from the previous 600-700 range.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Nov 18, 2019. Historical patterns for this SKU (Jade HW Skinny Denim) suggest a significant demand drop as the year concludes, following the autumn/back-to-school surges. Demand has recently softened from the ~700-800 range to approximately 533 units (average of P39-P40). We are currently in a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 3700 units; however, as noted in previous carry-over insights, orders from P1 (808), P3 (621), P14 (1008), and P34 (721) are categorized as lost or indefinitely delayed based on the 'In-transit' balance and lack of conclusion messages. This leaves approximately 542 units actually expected in the short term (from P4). To prevent over-ordering given the 3700 units 'pipeline', the OR backend parameters must reflect the current stabilized demand regime and the 2-period promised lead time. I'll set mu_hat based on the most recent regime (P39-P40) to better capture the downward seasonal trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Autumn peak (~700-800) has concluded, with demand stabilizing at an average of ~533 (P39-P40). Total 'In-transit' of 3700 units includes 3158 units from confirmed lost/severely delayed orders (P1, P3, P14, P34).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for SKU 706016001 (High-waisted skinny jeans) has transitioned from the autumn peak to a more stable late-year regime. Since Period 39 (2019-11-04), demand has stabilized at an average of 537.6 units (P39: 485, P40: 581, P41: 547). The total 'In-transit' of 3700 units is highly misleading as it includes 3158 units from confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed orders (P1: 808, P3: 621, P14: 1008, P34: 721). The actual effective pipeline is 0 units. To address this, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 (promised) to trigger the OR engine's logic while setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3-period regime (N=3). Setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*avg = 3*538 = 1614 ensures the order covers current demand despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory is 0; the 3700 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P14, P34). Demand regime since P39 is stable at ~538 units/period.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 43 (2019/12/2), we observe an extreme demand spike in Period 42 (3100 units), which aligns with Black Friday/Cyber Monday week. Given the product is 'Jade HW Skinny Denim TRS', this is a significant seasonal event. The previous baseline (P39-P41) was ~538 units, but P42 is nearly 6x that. However, our effective pipeline inventory remains 0, as the 3700 units in-transit are confirmed lost (orders from P1, P3, P14, P34). To prevent the OR backend from seeing these lost units as incoming stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for L to maintain a lead time of 2 while effectively resetting the order logic. I am also using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the extreme P42 outlier while forecasting for the remainder of the holiday season (December). I estimate mu_hat at (1+2)*1100 to account for sustained higher demand post-Black Friday but tapering from the 3100 peak, and sigma_hat is set high to accommodate the extreme volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Black Friday/Cyber Monday demand spike confirmed at Period 42: Demand reached 3100 units, a 475% increase over the Nov baseline (~538). Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed 0 due to 3700 units from lost orders (P1, P3, P14, P34).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44 (2019/12/9), we are analyzing the aftermath of the Black Friday/Cyber Monday (P42) demand spike where demand hit 3,100 units. Period 43 demand returned to a higher-than-average baseline of 674 units, likely due to holiday shopping tailwinds. On-hand inventory remains 0. The 'In-transit' count of 5,768 units is heavily inflated by 3,700 units from confirmed lost orders (P1, P3, P14, P34), leaving an effective pipeline of 2,068 units (ordered in P43). Given the lead time of 2 periods, the P43 order is expected in P45. We need to maintain a high base stock to capture remaining December demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (periods 39-43) to capture the pre-and-post spike levels (avg ~1077, though the OR engine will cap the influence of the P42 spike) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to account for the high volatility seen during this peak retail season.

Carry-over insight: Post-Black Friday demand (P43) stabilized at 674, significantly higher than the Nov baseline (~533), suggesting a sustained holiday season baseline for December.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the mid-December holiday season (Period 45, 2019/12/16). Recent demand has stabilized post-Black Friday at a higher baseline (P43: 674, P44: 680) compared to the November average (~533). This indicates a sustained December gift-buying regime. I will use a recent_N of 2 to capture this specific December mean (average ~677). Regarding inventory, the 'In-transit' figure of 6460 is heavily distorted by confirmed lost orders from Periods 1, 3, 14, and 34 (totaling 3158 units). Although the OR backend automatically caps orders based on pipeline inventory, these lost units remain in the backend's pipeline calculation indefinitely. To compensate for this 'ghost' inventory and ensure the OR engine actually places an order, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 2 (the promised LT) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to account for the current demand levels. Note: the OR engine will subtract the full 6460 from its base stock; since the base stock calculation for (L+1) periods at current demand (approx 677 * 3 = 2031) is less than the stale pipeline, the backend might not order unless the cap allows or the target is high. However, providing the most accurate recent demand parameters (N=2) is the best lever available to signal the need for stock.

Carry-over insight: December holiday baseline confirmed: Following the Black Friday spike, demand has stabilized at ~677 units (P43-P44), up from the November baseline of ~533 (+27%).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering late December holiday demand. Current on-hand inventory is 1411 units following the arrival of the Period 43 order (2068 units). The Period 44 order (692 units) is expected to arrive during Period 46. Demand after the Black Friday spike (P42: 3100) has stabilized into a December holiday baseline, with P43-P45 demand at 674, 680, and 657 (mean = 670). Pipeline inventory contains 692 units (P44 order), as the 3700 units from early periods (P1, P3, P14, P34) are confirmed lost and ignored. To maintain the 95% service level for the upcoming two periods (lead time 2 + review 1), I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods of the holiday baseline (N=3) and L to calculate based on the most recent successful delivery of 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: December holiday demand baseline confirmed at ~670 units per period (P43-P45) following the Black Friday spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8089.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 47 (Dec 30). In the previous periods, we observed the Black Friday spike (P42: 3100 units) followed by a stable December holiday baseline of approximately 670 units. Demand in the most recent period (P46) dropped to 475, which likely indicates the end of the holiday surge as we transition into January. Historically (Jan 2019 samples), demand at the start of the year was around 700 units. Given the transition, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the Dec/early Jan levels (approx 620 units/period). On-hand inventory is 936 units. Total in-transit is 4392, but based on carry-over insights, 3158 units (P1, P3, P14, P34) are confirmed lost. The recent order from P43 (2068 units) arrived in P45, and the order from P44 (692 units) is expected to arrive during P46 (visible in P47 conclude) or P47. This brings effective pipeline inventory (excluding confirmed losses) to 692 units. The OR backend will calculate the order based on this adjusted pipeline and demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Post-holiday demand decline observed in Period 46 (475 units), moving away from the December holiday baseline of ~670 units.
