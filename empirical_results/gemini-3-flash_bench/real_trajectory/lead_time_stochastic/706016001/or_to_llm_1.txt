Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in the Period 2 conclude (Read at P2) and Period 3 Start (Read at P3) is expected behavior. No evidence of delays yet.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical samples (Jan-Feb) show a mean demand of ~689 units. In-game demand for P1 (671) and P2 (673) is very stable and aligns with historical averages. The product is 'High-waisted skinny denim' from the Divided collection, which is a staple item with relatively steady demand, though it might see slight spring increases.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 1601 (P1: 808 + P2: 793). Total Pipeline = 1601. \n4. Strategy: We need to cover demand for Period 3 (Current), Period 4 (Lead time L1), and Period 5 (Lead time L2). Total exposure = 3 periods. Estimated demand = 689 * 3 = 2067 units.

Historical demand samples (694, 576, 685, 715, 774) and recent demand (671, 673, 539) suggest a mean demand of approximately 660 units per period. The SKU is 'High-waisted skinny denim', a staple item in the Divided collection, showing relatively stable demand.\n3. **OR Recommendation Reconcilation**: The OR baseline recommends 0 because the pipeline (2,222) far exceeds the target base stock for a (2+1) period horizon (~1,980 to 2,100 units).

If P1 is lost, our pipeline is effectively 621. \n4. **OR Baseline**: OR recommends 439 based on a capped base-stock policy. Given the potential loss of the P1 shipment (808 units), we must ensure we cover the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Assuming a current demand mean of ~500, we need approx 1500 units in the pipeline.

In-transit consists of 1979 units, but after subtracting the lost P1 (808) and P3 (621) orders, the effective pipeline is only 550 units (the P8 order). Total reliable inventory (on-hand + reliable in-transit) = 1240 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand averaged ~675 in early Feb but shifted to a mean of ~490 from March onwards. Recently, demand is showing a slight upward trend (P7: 511, P8: 560). April typically sees a spring sales lift for apparel like denim. Expecting demand around 550-600. 4. Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it counts the lost orders in the pipeline. With a reliable supply of 1240 units and a lead time of 2, I need to cover demand for Period 9, 10, and 11. 3 periods * 600 demand = 1800 units required.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of 468 units (Periods 5-9 average is ~475). Seasonal context (Jeans in mid-April) suggests steady performance. The OR recommendation of 0 units is driven by its inability to identify lost shipments, leading it to believe the pipeline is 1,429 units larger than it actually is. Strategy: Target a base stock level covering the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Estimated demand for 3 periods is approximately 1,425 units. Effective Inventory (On-hand 355 + Reliable Pipeline 1,110) is 1,465 units.

The 450 units from P10 are significantly overdue (6 periods), suggesting they are likely lost as well. If P10 is lost, the true pipeline is 650 units (P15 and P16).\n3. Demand Analysis: Demand has fluctuated: ~680 (Feb), ~480 (March), ~300 (April/May). However, Period 16 saw a spike to 533. While this might be a one-off fluctuation, the product (high-waisted denim) remains a year-round staple. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it sees a massive 'In-transit' figure (2529) which it hasn't discounted for losses. I must ensure coverage. If we assume P10 is lost, we only have 350 units arriving soon (P15) and 300 thereafter (P16). Given current on-hand is 0 and we just missed 533 units of demand, we are in a stockout. I will order 400 units to rebuild inventory against the recent demand spike and provide a buffer for the high probability of further shipment losses.",

Lost Shipment Reconciliation: As documented in carry-over insights, orders from P1 (808), P3 (621), and P10 (450) are confirmed lost (total 1,879 units). Total In-transit is reported at 2,279. Subtracting the lost 1,879 units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 400 units (the P17 order). 3. Demand Analysis: Demand has rebounded from the April/May slump (~180-340) to a higher June regime (~450-530). This suggests a summer seasonal trend for 'Jade HW Skinny Denim'. 4. Inventory Position: On-hand is 199. Real Pipeline is 400. Total effective inventory is 599. Given the current demand (Avg ~490 over last two weeks), this is only sufficient for slightly more than one period. 5.

However, based on the Carry-over insights, P1 (808), P3 (621), and P10 (450) are confirmed lost, totaling 1,879 units. Therefore, the effective In-transit (pipeline) is 3,179 - 1,879 = 1,300 units.

While there was a spike in early June, the last two weeks show a decline. We are entering July. Historically, demand in February was ~680 and dropped to ~300 in April/May.\n4. **Supply Gap**: We are currently out of stock.

While the July 22nd demand was lower, the 8-week average is approximately 400. \n4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR baseline suggests 0 units because it counts the full 3,679 units in-transit as valid inventory.

With 1,206 units effective, we are currently at an optimal stock level.

Currently, I have 543 units on-hand. With a demand of ~700/week and an actual lead time of 1-3 periods, the effective inventory (543 OH + 450 P32) of 993 units is only enough to cover approximately 1.4 weeks of demand.

  "rationale": "The SKU 706016001 (Skinny Denim Trousers) has a high holding cost vs profit ratio (q=0.95), suggesting we should carry ample safety stock, yet current on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 40. The OR recommendation of 0 is clearly incorrect because it bases its logic on the 'In-transit' figure of 7229 units. However, my 'Carry-over Insights' confirm that 5,029 units from 9 different periods (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is actually (7,229 - 5,029) = 2,200 units. These 2,200 units consist of orders from P36 (arrived), P38, P39, and P40. Specifically, P38 (800), P39 (800), and P40 (600) are likely still in transit. Demand has stabilized at a high regime of ~600 units/week. Since lead time typically fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, I need to ensure that the effective pipeline covers at least 3 weeks of demand (~1,800 units). Currently, the effective 'living' pipeline is 2,200, but we started Period 41 with 0 on-hand. To maintain a buffer against further lost shipments and the high likelihood of stockouts, I will place an order for 600 units to replace the stock expected to be consumed in the coming period and maintain a healthy pipeline.",

Tracking history confirms 9 shipments are permanently lost (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34), totaling 5,029 units. Additionally, the shipment from P38 (800 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost. The effective pipeline consists only of P40 (600 units) and P41 (600 units), totaling 1,200 units. The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely based on the inflated raw pipeline figure and does not account for these losses. To cover expected demand over the lead-time window (approx. 600 units/period for 3 periods), we need roughly 1,800 units.

I confirm that orders from Periods 1, 3, 10, 17, 19, 24, 26, 29, 34, 38 are lost (total 5,829 units). The current 'In-transit' of 7,629 units includes these 5,829 lost units, making the effective pipeline only 1,800 units (Orders from P40: 600, P41: 600, P42: 600). 2. **Demand Analysis**: Period 42 saw a massive spike to 3,100 units (likely Black Friday/Cyber Monday impact). This follows the late September surge previously noted. While 3,100 is an outlier, the sustained demand regime remains high (estimated baseline ~600-800). 3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Effective pipeline is 1,800 units over the next 3 periods. Given the 3,100 demand spike and the risk of further holiday shopping, 1,800 units in the pipeline is insufficient to cover potential demand and the 50% probability of shipment loss. 4. **OR Baseline**: The OR recommends 0 because it sees physical 'In-transit' as very high, but it fails to subtract the lost shipments. Following the OR recommendation will lead to a guaranteed stockout. 5. **Action**: I will order 1,200 units.

The true pipeline consists only of P42 (600 units) and P43 (1,200 units), totaling 1,800 units.

  "rationale": "1. **Lead-Time & Pipeline Analysis**: The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, actual lead times rotate between 1, 2, and 3 periods, but reliability is poor. As established in Carry-Over Insights, ten shipments (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P24, P26, P29, P34, P38) totaling 5,829 units are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' shows 8,429 units. Subtracting the 5,829 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 2,600 units (composed of orders from P40, P41, P42, P43, and P44). \n\n2. **Inventory Status**: On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 44. \n\n3. **Effective Pipeline Breakdown**:\n- P40 (600) & P41 (600): Arrived in P43.\n- P42 (600): Ordered 3 periods ago, hasn't arrived. Historically, orders over 4 periods late are lost.

With only 3 periods remaining (P45, P46, P47), total expected remaining demand is roughly 2,100 units.\n\n5. **Decision**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely counts the 'lost' units as valid inventory. Since the effective pipeline (2,600) already covers the remaining expected demand (~2,100) even if some P42 units are delayed, and the game ends in Period 47, placing another order now would only risk high holding costs for units that arrive too late to be sold.
