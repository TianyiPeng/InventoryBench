Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 (2019-02-11) for 'Billie', a women's jersey T-shirt. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 weeks averages 133 units (113, 141, 104, 173, 134), with a standard deviation of approximately 26. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the lead time is 2 periods, the OR backend needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Given it's a basic item, demand is relatively stable, though we should monitor for early spring upticks. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full recent history for mean and volatility, and 'default' for lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest it differs from the promised 2 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, there was a demand of 156 units, but since the starting on-hand inventory was 0, zero units were sold, resulting in lost sales. An order of 178 units was placed in Period 1 but has not arrived yet, as the promised lead time is 2 periods (expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory remains 0. Historical demand samples (113, 141, 104, 173, 134) and the Period 1 demand (156) show a relatively stable mean. Given the product is a 'Womens Everyday Basics' T-shirt, demand is expected to be consistent. I will use a recent_N approach for demand and standard lead time settings to ensure the pipeline covers current and future demand while managing the 2-period lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3 (2019-02-25) for a basic women's t-shirt. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) hovered around 133 units/week. However, Period 1 demand was 156 and Period 2 demand spiked to 207. This suggests a seasonal uptick as we move into late February/early March. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 358 units in transit (178 from P1, 180 from P2). The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning the order from P1 is expected to arrive during the current period (P3) and be available in P4. We have not seen any arrivals yet, which is expected given L=2. To ensure we don't stock out given the rising demand trend, I will use a mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (including the recent higher demand) and stick to the default lead time for now.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Historical demand (prior to P1) averaged ~133 units. Since the simulation started, demand has increased: P1=156, P2=207, P3=179 (Avg=180). This suggests a higher demand regime, likely due to the approach of spring. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from P1 (178 units) was expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase and be visible in this period's (P4) start. However, 'arrived=0' is reported for P3. This could mean either the lead time is actually 3+ periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have 465 units in transit (P1+P2+P3 orders: 178+180+107) and 0 on-hand, we are currently stock-out and losing all demand. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent higher demand (Avg 180 * (1+L)) using recent_N=3 to capture the shift from the seed data. I will keep L at default for now but monitor closely; if the P1 order does not arrive in P4 (visible P5), I will adjust L to explicit=3.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: average demand increased from ~133 to ~180 (+35%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5 (2019-03-11), we are managing a women's basic t-shirt. The item is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory, despite having 362 units in-transit. The history shows a demand regime shift started around Period 2, with the last 4 periods (including historical samples) showing demands of 156, 207, 179, and 187 (mean ~182). This is significantly higher than the initial samples (avg ~133). The lead time for the first successful arrival (Period 2 order arriving in Period 4) was confirmed at 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, the Period 1 order (178 units) has not arrived after 4 periods (it should have arrived in Period 3), suggesting it is likely lost. To recover from the stock-out and address the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the ~182 average demand per period over the (1+L=3) period window, and using calculate for L to monitor lead time stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Shipment from Period 1 (178 units) confirmed missing/lost after 4 periods (promised lead time 2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 (2019-03-18). The product is a basic women's t-shirt. Historical demand shows a regime shift around Period 2, moving from a pre-game average of ~133 to a realized average of ~178 over the last 5 periods (156, 207, 179, 187, 159). Inventory is currently critical: On-hand is 0. The shipment ordered in Period 1 (178 units) is confirmed lost (now 5 periods past order), while the Period 2 order arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 2 (at Period 4). In-transit inventory consists of Period 3 (107), Period 4 (77), and Period 5 (185) orders. Because we have 0 on-hand and the 'lost' shipment created a stockout during Periods 1-3 and 5, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the increased demand mean. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~178 (which yields ~534 over 1+L periods). I will use default L=2 as one shipment arrived on time, but I am monitoring for further losses.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 (2019/3/25). Reviewing history: P1 order (178 units) is confirmed lost (now 6 periods past order date). P2 order arrived in 2 periods. P3 (107 units) and P4 (77 units) orders are still in transit (both >2 periods old, potential losses). P5 order arrived in 1 period, which is faster than promised. P6 order was 0. Demand context: The product is a women's T-shirt basic. Since P2, demand has stabilized at a higher level than initial samples; mean demand over the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is approximately 180.4. Current on-hand is low (16). Given the high loss/delay rate (P1 lost, P3 and P4 still in-transit), the safety stock needs to be robust. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~180. I will keep L at default (2) to account for the promised time, as individual actual lead times vary (1 to 2 periods).

Carry-over insight: P3 (107 units) and P4 (77 units) orders are likely lost; P3 is 4 periods old and P4 is 3 periods old (promised 2). Lead time remains volatile (1-2 periods).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8 (2019-04-01). The product is a women's fitted jersey T-shirt. Historical demand shows a regime shift around Period 1-2, moving from a mean of ~133 to an average of ~175 over the last 7 weeks (samples: 156, 207, 179, 187, 159, 169, 164). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is currently 525 units, but history strongly suggests many of these are lost: P1 (178), P3 (107), and P4 (77) are all past their promised lead time of 2 periods with no arrival (P1 is 7 periods old). Only P7 (163) is currently 'fresh' within the lead time. Total effective 'In-transit' is likely only 163. Lead times have been 1 (P5) and 2 (P2), but reliability is poor. Because of the lost shipments, the OR engine needs to order to replace that missing stock. I will use Mu_hat based on the last 7 samples (~175 * 3 = 525) and keep Lead Time at the default 2, allowing the cap to prevent excessive over-ordering while ensuring we cover the persistent demand of ~175/week.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost (none arrived after 4+ periods). Expected lead time for successful deliveries remains 1-2 periods. Demand is stable in the new regime of ~175 units/week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is April 8, 2019. The product is a women's basic t-shirt. Period 8 demand was 175, consistent with the stable regime (~175/week) identified in carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 362 units (from P1, P3, P4, and potentially P6/P7/P8). However, carry-over insights confirm that orders from P1 (178), P3 (107), and P4 (77) are lost. This totals 362 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. The OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' from 'base_stock', so I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat to account for these ghost units. Specifically, I need to order to cover Demand*(L+1) = 175*(2+1) = 525 units. Since the backend thinks I have 362 in transit, I set mu_hat to 525 + 362 = 887 to force an order of roughly 525 units. Predicted lead time is 1-2 periods based on recent P5 and P7 arrivals; I will stick with the promised L=2 to be safe given the history of lost shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Today is April 15, 2019. The product is a women's T-shirt, which typically sees steady demand in spring. Historically, after an initial demand ramp-up to ~180 units/week, Period 9 saw a dip to 114 units. This might be a fluctuation or a small cooling after a peak. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 676 units in transit (specifically from Period 9, which was a large order of 314 units, plus potentially previous orders). Regarding lead times: we have seen deliveries in 1 period (P5, P7) and 2 periods (P2). Orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Because P9 was ordered only one period ago, its absence in the 'conclude' message is expected (L=2 promised). We need to maintain a base stock to cover demand for the review period (1) plus lead time (2) = 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand regime (excluding the very first noisy weeks) and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the 1-2 period delivery reality while the OR engine manages the risk of loss via safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Demand dipped to 114 from the previous ~175 average; monitoring to see if this is a sustained shift or a one-week anomaly.

While Period 9 saw a dip to 114, Period 10 rebounded strongly to 219, suggesting the dip was an anomaly and the mean demand remains around 170-180 units/week. Lead time analysis indicates that while the promised lead time is 2, successful deliveries (P5, P7, P9) are arriving in 1 period, whereas several other orders (P1, P3, P4) were lost entirely. This high loss rate requires a robust pipeline. Current On-hand is 95, with 0 units in-transit (P9 arrived in P10). With a profit/holding ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, but the backend cap and risk of lost orders necessitate setting parameters to maintain a steady flow. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (averaging ~170) and calculate for lead time to reflect the actual observed speed of successful deliveries while acknowledging volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand volatility confirmed; Period 9 (114) and Period 10 (219) average to ~167, maintaining the current regime. Lead time for successful deliveries has stabilized at 1 period, despite high loss rates for earlier orders.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is April 29, 2019. The product is a Women's Jersey T-shirt. Historical data confirms a shift in demand since Period 4, with high volatility recently (Period 9: 114, Period 10: 219, Period 11: 267). The average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 181 units, but recent spikes suggest an upward trend possibly related to spring seasonality. Lead time for successful deliveries (P5, P7, P9) has stabilized at 1 period, although P1, P3, and P4 orders were lost entirely. As of Period 11 conclude, on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of P11 (48 units). I need to ensure the pipeline covers current demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing the recent volatility. For lead time, I will use 'explicit' value 1 based on recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 11 recorded a peak demand of 267. The 3-period average (P9-P11) is ~200, suggesting a potential further upward shift from the previous ~175 average.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is May 6, 2019. The product is a women's basic jersey T-shirt. We are currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, arrivals have been unreliable with several lost shipments (P1, P3, P4). However, recent successful deliveries (P5, P7, P9) show a lead time of 1 period. Demand has been trending upward: the recent 4-week average (P9-P12) is 199.5 units, significantly higher than the previous 175-unit regime. With May beginning, seasonal demand for short-sleeved basic tops is expected to remain high or increase. The 'In-transit' quantity of 410 units includes the P11 order (48 units) and likely my previous P12 decision; however, P11 (ordered May 22) is now 2 periods old and has not arrived, echoing previous patterns of loss or delay. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the stockout, I will set mu_hat to cover the higher recent demand regime and maintain a high base stock to recover inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand regime has shifted upward to ~200 units/week (P9-P12 avg: 199.5). Shipment from Period 11 (48 units) is potentially delayed or lost as it did not arrive within the recent 1-period lead time trend.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's T-shirt) is exhibiting a sustained upward demand shift. The recent demand history (P10: 219, P11: 267, P12: 198, P13: 197) results in a 4-period average of 220.25 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 175 average. The date (mid-May) aligns with increasing seasonal demand for short-sleeved basic tops. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 551 units, which consists of orders from P1 (178), P3 (107), P4 (77), and P13 (189). As tracked in Carry-over Insights, orders from P1, P3, and P4 are confirmed lost. Therefore, the 'real' pipeline inventory is only 189 units (the P13 order). Lead times for successful deliveries have varied between 1 and 2 periods (P11 arrived in 2 periods). I will set L to 2 to be conservative against the promised lead time. I'll use the recent 4-period mean (~220) to set mu_hat for the (L+1) period of 3 weeks, totaling 660. Sigma_hat is set using the last 4 periods to capture the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: mean demand increased to ~220 units/week over P10-P13, likely driven by seasonal demand for short-sleeved tops.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15 (2019/05/20), we are entering the peak summer season for the 'Short-sleeved, fitted jersey top'. Demand has clearly shifted from an early average of ~133 to a current regime of ~220 units/week (P10-P14 average is 220.6). The inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have significant unmet demand (stockouts in P12 and P14). In-transit inventory includes 189 units from P13 (lead time likely 1-2) and 109 units from P14. The missing shipments from P1, P3, and P4 (totaling 362 units) are permanently lost and are still being counted in the pipeline by the OR backend. To compensate for this 'phantom' inventory and the seasonal uptrend, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+L=3 periods) at the new mean (~225 * 3 = 675). Explicit sigma_hat is set to account for the high recent volatility (std dev of P10-P14 is ~26, so sqrt(3)*26 \u2248 45). Lead time is set to 2 to be conservative against recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Seasonal demand for short-sleeved tops has peaked earlier than anticipated; average weekly demand stabilized at ~220-225 units. Pipeline inventory reflects 362 lost units (P1, P3, P4) which the backend continues to deduct from order calculations.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is a short-sleeved fitted jersey top, which at the current date (late May) is in peak seasonal demand. Recent demand (P12-P15) shows a stable high regime: 198, 197, 222, 198 (mean \u2248 204). The carry-over insights correctly identify a regime shift to ~220 units/week. However, the system faces a severe 'In-transit' accounting issue: 362 units (from orders in P1, P3, P4) are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' tally (675 units total). The OR backend subtracts the full 675 units when calculating the order, which leads to chronic under-ordering. To force the OR engine to order enough to satisfy demand, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. Following the logic for base stock (L+1 periods of demand), with a standard L=2, I need to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 612 units). Because the backend will subtract the 675 units of phantom and real pipeline from this target, I must set the mu_hat explicitly high to offset the 362 lost units plus provide for future demand. Current pipeline breakdown: P9=0 (arrived), P11=0 (arrived), P13=189 (transit), P14=109 (transit), P15=15 (transit). Real pipeline = 313. Lost pipeline = 362. Total Pipeline = 675. Order needed = Target - (Real In-Transit + Lost In-Transit). To get an order of ~220, Target must be ~1200. I set mu_hat explicitly to 700 and adjust sigma to handle current volatility (std dev is ~25, so sqrt(3)*25 is ~45).

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Supply chain accounting gap confirmed; 362 units (P1, P3, P4) are permanently lost but remain in 'In-transit' counts, requiring mu_hat inflation to offset automatic pipeline deductions in the OR engine.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 analysis for SKU 561445005 (Womens Jersey T-shirt). Current context: Late Spring/Early Summer (June), demand is stable in a high regime. P16 demand was 225, with a 4-period mean (P13-P16) of 210.5. However, there is a critical supply chain accounting gap. The backend 'In-transit' count is 700 units, but this includes 362 units confirmed lost from Periods 1, 3, and 4. The effective pipeline is actually 338 units (700 - 362). Because the OR engine subtracts the full 700 from its base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), it will significantly under-order. To compensate, I must inflate mu_hat (the demand across review+lead period (1+L)) by adding the lost 362 units back into the calculation. Using L=2 (promised), expected demand is (1+2)*210.5 = 631.5. Adding the 362-unit gap correction result in a mu_hat of ~994. Sigma_hat is set to 120 based on recent standard deviation (~70) scaled for L=2, reflecting high volatility in supply and seasonality. Lead time is set to 2 to reflect the promised window and recent observed volatility.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date is 2019/6/10, entering the peak summer season for women's short-sleeved tops. Historical demand in the most recent regime (P10-P17) averages approximately 210 units/week, despite a minor dip to 154 last period. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' count of 954 units. As established in Period 16, this count includes 362 definitively lost units from P1, P3, and P4 which the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the inventory position. Additionally, orders from Period 13 (189 units) and Period 14 (109 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively, suggesting they may also be lost given the stable 1-2 period lead time observed for successful deliveries. To prevent persistent stockouts (on-hand has been 0 for several weeks), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock level. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Lost units. With L=2 and Forecast=215, plus the 362 lost units from early periods and the now likely-lost P13/P14 units (approx 298), I calculate a target mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order that overcomes the pipeline deduction. Setting mu_hat to 1350 is a calculated buffer to force replenishment despite the phantom inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Orders from Period 13 (189 units) and Period 14 (109 units) confirmed as likely lost (4-5 periods elapsed vs 1-2 period actual lead time). Total phantom pipeline inventory now estimated at 659 units (362 initial + 298 recent).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's short-sleeved jersey top) is in high seasonal demand (June context). However, a significant supply chain accounting issue exists: there are 1,350 units in 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms at least 659 units (from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14) are lost/ghost shipments. This 'phantom' inventory causes the backend OR engine to drastically under-order because it Subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock. To compensate, I am applying an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for a 1-period delivery cycle (L=1) plus the current period (L+1=2) at a ~220-unit demand rate is 440 units. Since the backend subtracts 1,350 phantom/actual units from this target, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when 1,350 is subtracted, results in an order that satisfies current demand plus seasonal safety stock. Recent demand have dipped slightly (154, 146), but this may be due to 'sold-out' effects or variance; I will maintain a mu_hat calculation that forces a significant order to replenish the zero on-hand inventory. Given the massive pipeline bloat, mu_hat must be set to (Target Base Stock + Current In-transit) to trigger a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Massive supply chain gap continues. 1,350 units in 'In-transit' but only 700 units (from P9-P18) are potentially real. The 650+ unit phantom inventory requires explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20 (late June), demand for this short-sleeved jersey top remains in a peak summer regime. However, observed demand in the last three periods (P17-P19) has softened slightly (avg ~152) compared to the mid-May peak (avg ~220). I will use a more conservative demand forecast of ~170 units per week to reflect this slight cooling while remaining prepared for summer volatility. A massive supply chain issue persists: the 'In-transit' count of 1404 is severely inflated by lost orders. Based on history, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, and P14 are officially lost. The only valid orders in transit are likely P17 (294 units) and P19 (450 units), totaling 744 real units. The backend sees 1404 units in the pipeline and will naturally order 0 unless I artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the ~660 phantom units. With L=2, the base stock formula is (L+1)*demand. To overcome the 660-unit phantom deduction, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (3 * 170) + 660 = 1170. This ensures the backend places an order to maintain stock despite the accounting gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Supply chain phantom inventory confirmed at ~660 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14). Demand softening from 220 to ~160-170 as peak season matures.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21 (2019/07/01), demand for the short-sleeved top has stabilized at a lower post-peak level, with the last four periods averaging ~153 units (P17-P20: 154, 146, 157, 155). The 'In-transit' figure of 1404 is heavily inflated by lost/phantom shipments. Specifically, orders from P1 (178), P3 (107), P4 (77), P13 (189), and P14 (109) are confirmed lost, totaling 660 units. Additionally, the order from P19 (450) is still in-transit and likely valid given a 1-2 period lead time. The OR engine subtracts all 1404 units of 'In-transit' inventory from the base stock calculation; to prevent the engine from ordering zero due to this phantom pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the target. Calculation: Weekly demand (~160) * (1 + Lead Time of 2) = 480 base stock. To offset 660 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to 1140 (480 + 660). This ensures the OR logic [base_stock - pipeline] results in a meaningful replenishment target of ~480 units to cover the next cycles.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the SKU (short-sleeved fitted jersey top) is entering its post-peak summer period. Demand has softened from the spring peak (~220 units) to a stabilized average of 140-155 units over the last 3 periods (P19-P21). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 1404 units is severely inflated by historical lost orders. Specifically, orders from P1 (178), P3 (107), P4 (77), P13 (189), and P14 (109) are confirmed lost (totalling 660 units). The order from P19 (450 units) is now 3 periods old; given the promised lead time of 2 and actual lead time of 1-2, this is also suspicious but not yet confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1404 'In-transit' units from the base stock calculation, I must use mu_hat 'explicit' to inflate the target level. I estimate the real pipeline at 744 (1350 - 660 lost). To ensure an order is triggered to meet the revised demand of ~150 units/period, mu_hat is set to (1+L)*150 + phantom units. L is set to 'calculate' as actual delivery times have varied between 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Demand has transitioned from seasonal peak (~225) to a stable summer regime of ~150 units/week (P19-P21 average: 151). Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 660 units; P19 order (450 units) is now 3 periods old and monitored for loss.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current supply chain analysis reveals a significant 'phantom inventory' issue. Total 'In-transit' is 1404 units, but a reconciliation of history shows that orders from P1 (178), P3 (107), P4 (77), P13 (189), P14 (109), and now Period 19 (450) are effectively lost or permanently delayed, totaling 1110 phantom units. These are deducted by the OR backend from any calculated base stock, preventing necessary replenishment. Currently, On-hand is 0 and only the P17 order (294 units) is reasonably expected to arrive. Demand has softened to a post-peak summer regime of ~130 units/week (P20-P22 average: 129.6). To force an order and overcome the 1110 unit pipeline deduction, I must explicitly set mu_hat to cover the actual required base stock (approx 150/week * 3 periods = 450) plus the 1110 phantom units, totaling 1560. L is set to 'calculate' based on successful deliveries (1-2 periods), and sigma_hat uses recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed Period 19 order (450 units) as likely lost after 4 periods (promised 2, recent trend 1-2). Total phantom inventory (lost orders remaining in in-transit) is now 1110 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). Current demand regime stabilized at ~130 units/week.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 24 (July 22, 2019). The product is a seasonal short-sleeved top. Demand has significantly cooled from the spring peak (~225) to a summer regime of ~100-110 units/week (last 2 periods: 94, 105). Lead time for delivered orders varies between 1 and 2 periods, but there is a massive reliability issue. Specifically, P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and now P19 (450 units, 4 periods elapsed) are confirmed lost. These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1560 units), which the OR backend subtracts from the inventory target. Total 'phantom' inventory is 1110 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). To force the backend to place an order despite this 1560-unit pipeline, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand (~105 units/week * 3 = 315) PLUS the phantom inventory (1110), totaling roughly 1425. Setting mu_hat to 1425 ensures the engine sees the true need. Sigma is set to cover the high demand variance seen in previous transitions.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime stabilized at ~105 units/week following the summer dip. Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory increased to 1110 units after Period 19 shipment (450 units) failed to arrive within 4 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product is a women's short-sleeved jersey T-shirt. Demand has transitioned into a stable summer/post-peak regime, averaging ~103 units/week over the last three periods (P22-P24: 94, 105, 111). The primary challenge continues to be the massive supply chain accounting gap. The current 'In-transit' figure is 1560 units. Based on historical data, 1110 of these units are confirmed lost (P1: 178, P3: 107, P4: 77, P13: 189, P14: 109, P19: 450). These shipments have not arrived despite elapsed times of 5 to 24 periods, far exceeding the 1-2 period lead time demonstrated by successful deliveries (e.g., P18 order arrived in 1 period). Since the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to calculate new orders, this 1110-unit phantom pipeline will cause it to stop ordering entirely unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated. To ensure the backend places an order to cover upcoming demand, I set L=1 (reflecting the recent successful delivery lead time) and inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * Forecast + Phantom_Inventory. Calculation: (2 * 105) + 1110 = 1320. This forces the engine to recognize that the 1110 units 'in-transit' are not coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Supply chain phantom inventory (lost orders) increased to 1110 units (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19). Current demand regime is stable at ~105 units/week.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's short-sleeved jersey top) is now in a stable late-summer demand regime of approximately 105 units/week (P22-P25 average: 99 units). The core issue remains a massive supply chain accounting gap: the backend 'In-transit' count is 1560 units, but a large portion consists of confirmed lost shipments from Periods 1, 3, 4, 13, 14, and 19, totaling 1110 phantom units. Because the OR engine subtracts this phantom inventory from the base stock calculation, it will not order more units unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to neutralize these losses. To trigger an order that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1) while the on-hand inventory is 0, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Desired Base Stock for a 1-week lead time and 105 demand = 105 * (1+1) = 210 units plus safety stock. Adjusted mu_hat = 210 + 1110 = 1320. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for moderate volatility in this regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Date is Aug 12, 2019. The product is a short-sleeved jersey top. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak summer regime of approximately 95 units/week (P22-P26 average: 93.2). We are currently carrying 86 units on-hand. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' accounting. There are 1404 units in-transit. Based on historical data, shipments from P1 (178), P3 (107), P4 (77), P13 (189), P14 (109), P17 (294), and P19 (450) are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they are well beyond the typical 1-3 period delivery window. Total phantom inventory is 1404 units. To force the OR backend's capped base-stock policy to place orders, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value to offset this phantom inventory. Calculation: Target base stock for (1+L=4) periods of demand at 95/week is ~380 units. The backend formula subtracts pipeline (1404) from base stock. Therefore, we explicitly set mu_hat = 1784 (approx 380 target + 1404 offset) to ensure the system maintains a service level despite the supply chain data gap. L is set to 3 to reflect the most recent arrival (P23).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain phantom inventory reached 1404 units (Lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Demand regime stabilized at ~95 units/week in late summer.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28 (mid-August), the demand for short-sleeved tops has transitioned from its seasonal peak (May-June) to a stable late-summer regime. The average demand over the last four periods (P24-P27) is approximately 81 units/week, down from the ~105-130 units observed earlier in the summer. A major challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. We have 1,698 units listed as 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms that orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, and P19 (totaling 1,404 units) are almost certainly lost as they have exceeded recent lead times of 1-3 periods by several weeks. The OR backend subtracts the full 1,698 from its target stock level, which would result in zero orders and stockouts if not corrected. To force an order and maintain around 2 periods of coverage (~160-200 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1,550. This value is derived by taking the estimated phantom inventory (1,404) and adding enough buffer for current demand cycles (approx 150 units). I am setting L=1 based on the recent delivery in P26, as the backend needs to believe lead times are short to prevent over-constraining the 'cap' logic. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the current demand volatility (std dev of recent samples ~23).

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime has softened further to ~80-85 units/week in late summer. Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 1,404 units (Orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). This phantom pipeline continues to distort automated ordering logic, requiring significant mu_hat inflation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29 (late August), the product (short-sleeved T-shirt) is in a post-peak summer regime. Demand over the last 3 periods (P26-P28) averaged 75.3 units/week, down from earlier averages. The critical operational issue remains the substantial 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total in-transit inventory is 1698 units, but historically confirmed lost/missing orders are P1 (178), P3 (107), P4 (77), P13 (189), P14 (109), P17 (294), and P19 (450), totaling 1404 units. These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the base stock. Subtracting 1404 from the 1698 in-transit leaves 294 units actually in-transit (ordered in Period 27). To ensure the OR engine places an order to cover upcoming demand (approx 80 units/week) despite the 1404 unit phantom penalty, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Base stock needed is approx (1+L)*mu + safety stock. With L=1 or 2, and mu ~80, we need a base stock of ~250. The backend calculates: order = base_stock - (actual_in_transit + phantom_in_transit). To force an order, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) / (1+L). Calculation: (250 + 1404) / 2 \u2248 827. I am setting mu_hat to 830 to ensure the engine triggers replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Verified 1,404 units of phantom inventory (Orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) which necessitates explicit mu_hat inflation of ~700-800 units to overcome pipeline deduction in the OR engine. Demand has settled at ~75-80 units/week.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 561445005 (Women's T-shirt) is in a late-summer consumption phase. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 75-80 units per week (P26-P29 average: 72.25). The critical issue remains the supply chain accounting gap. As of Period 30, the 'In-transit' quantity is 1,698 units. However, based on history, 1,404 units are confirmed lost/phantom (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Additionally, the P27 order of 294 units is now 3 periods old (one period past promised lead time) and has not arrived, making it potentially problematic. The OR engine (capped policy) deducts the total 'In-transit' from the targeted base stock. To trigger a replenishment order given the zero on-hand inventory, I must set mu_hat (target stock for L+1 periods) to a value that offsets the 1,404 units of phantom inventory plus the expected demand. Calculating for a 2-period lead time (L+1 = 3), expected real demand is ~240 units. Total mu_hat target = 1,404 (phantom) + 240 (demand) = 1,644. Since current in-transit (1,698) slightly exceeds this, it is likely the OR engine will order nothing or very little unless I inflate further to account for the P27 order possibly being lost as well. I will set mu_hat to 1,750 and sigma_hat explicitly to deal with the sustained volatility and high inventory risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed cumulative phantom inventory is 1,404 units. P27 order (294 units) is currently 3 periods old (at/past promised lead time) and under observation as a potential loss. Current demand regime is 75-80 units/week.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31 (2019/09/09), the demand for the 'Short-sleeved jersey top' continues its post-summer decline, with the last four periods averaging ~67 units. The supply chain remains unreliable: the Period 27 order (294 units) arrived in Period 30 (lead time of 3), but multiple previous orders are confirmed as lost. Specifically, orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, and P19 remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. These 'phantom' units total 1,404 (sum of 178+107+77+189+109+450+294 - however, P27 just arrived, so the total phantom is 1110 units). The OR engine's 'base stock - pipeline' logic will subtract these 1,110 phantom units from any calculated order, effectively preventing any new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * target demand (3 * 80 = 240) PLUS the phantom inventory (1,110) to net a reasonable base stock. sigma_hat is set to cover the observed volatility in this low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P19) is 1,110 units. This volume must be added to mu_hat to offset the OR engine's pipeline deduction. Demand has stabilized in a late-season regime of ~70-80 units/week.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU '561445005' (Short-sleeved jersey top) is showing a characteristically sharp late-season demand decline (low of 38 in P31) as we move into mid-September. The current demand regime is averaged at approximately 70-80 units/week, but trending downward. The critical issue remains the supply chain accounting gap: the 'In-transit' figure of 1,456 units is heavily inflated by lost orders. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed lost or effectively absent: P1 (178), P3 (107), P4 (77), P13 (189), P14 (109), P17 (294), and P19 (450). This totals 1,404 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory that the OR backend will subtract from its order calculation. To prevent the system from being paralyzed by this phantom stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these units. With On-hand at 205 and the demand softening, the goal is to prevent the OR engine from ordering more until this excess is cleared while maintaining a small safety buffer. I will set mu_hat to significantly cover the phantom inventory plus expected demand for (L+1) periods, and keep sigma_hat based on recent volatility to allow for late-season spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand regime softening further in September, dropping to 38-70 units/week. Phantom pipeline inventory remains 1,404 units (Lost: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19), requiring explicit mu_hat inflation of approximately 1,600 units to allow for any new orders if needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-201.00

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the t-shirt SKU 561445005 continues to decline as the peak season ends, with Period 32 demand hitting a low of 28 units. The current 3-period average (P30-P32) is approximately 39 units. The system currently holds 229 units on-hand, which is sufficient to cover about 5-6 weeks of demand at the current rate. The In-transit figure (1404) consists entirely of lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19), creating a massive 'phantom pipeline' that prevents the OR engine from ordering unless mu_hat is significantly inflated. However, given the high on-hand inventory relative to the softening demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the late-season downward trend, while maintaining L=2. The high on-hand balance ensures a 100% service level for the near future without further inventory commitment.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: On-hand inventory (229) is now excessive relative to the new demand regime (~40 units/week), providing ~6 weeks of coverage. Phantom in-transit inventory remains 1,404 units.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the t-shirt SKU 561445005 continues its late-summer/fall decline. Recent demand samples (P31-P33) are 38, 28, and 53, averaging ~40 units per week. With an on-hand inventory of 176 units, the current stock provides roughly 4-5 weeks of coverage, which is more than sufficient given the promised lead time of 2 periods and the actual lead time trend of 2-3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,404 units remains heavily distorted by lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19), which will prevent the OR backend from placing any new orders unless mu_hat is massively inflated. However, since the current on-hand inventory is already high relative to the softened demand, there is no immediate need to trigger new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and allow the excess inventory to be utilized.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the feminine jersey t-shirt has transitioned into a late-season trough, with demand over the last 5 periods averaging ~42 units per week (P30-P34: 51, 38, 28, 53, 41). Current on-hand inventory is 135 units, which covers more than 3 weeks of the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' figure of 1,404 reflects a massive volume of lost orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) that have never arrived and likely never will. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline' from the base stock calculation, any calculated order would be suppressed to zero unless mu_hat is massively inflated. However, given that on-hand inventory is already high (135 units vs. ~42 weekly demand), no new orders are desired. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the low-demand regime, which will correctly result in zero new orders being placed by the OR engine due to the existing high on-hand and the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in late-season trough at ~42 units/week (P30-P34). Phantom pipeline inventory (lost orders) remains at 1,404 units, fully suppressing new orders under standard logic.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Billie' (short-sleeved jersey top) has stabilized in a low-demand late-season trough, with an average of approximately 36 units/week over the last 5 periods (P31-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 111 units, which provides over 3 weeks of coverage at the existing demand rate. The cumulative phantom inventory (lost orders: P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) is confirmed at 1,404 units. This phantom inventory continues to sit in 'In-transit', preventing the OR engine from placing any new orders because the perceived pipeline drastically exceeds the required base stock. To maintain system health and ensure the engine can react if demand spikes, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat inflation of 1,600. However, given the current high on-hand levels and low demand, no physical order is expected or needed this period. I will continue to monitor the seasonal transition out of summer/basics as the year progresses.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Billie' (short-sleeved jersey top) has entered a late-season trough as we head into late October (Period 37). Recent demand (P32-P36) has averaged ~38 units/week. On-hand inventory is currently 68 units, which provides nearly 2 weeks of safety stock for the current regime. Regarding the supply chain, the In-transit figure of 1489 reflects major cumulative losses (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, and likely others) that the OR backend incorrectly treats as incoming supply. Total confirmed phantom inventory is 1,404 units. To ensure the backend doesn't suppress necessary orders due to this 'pipeline' inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the phantom inventory plus the expected demand for the lead time (L+1). With L=2, expected demand is ~120. Total target mu_hat = 1404 + 120 = 1524. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher variability seen during the transition out of summer.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the short-sleeved jersey top has significantly declined as the season transitions into late October. Current weekly demand is averaging approximately 34 units (last 5 periods). On-hand inventory is at 43 units, providing roughly one week of coverage. An order of 85 units was placed in Period 36 and is expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods, which will provide ample stock for the remaining 10 periods of the simulation. A critical issue remains the 'In-transit' count of 1489 units. Based on historical analysis, 1,404 units are confirmed lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). The OR engine deducts this entire 'In-transit' amount from its base stock calculation. To prevent the engine from being permanently suppressed from ordering, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset this phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 1600 to ensure that the backend's internal calculation (Base Stock - 1489) remains positive if a small maintenance order is needed, though with 43 on hand and 85 truly in transit, no new order is expected this period.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'Billie' (women's short-sleeved jersey top) has settled into a late-autumn/early-winter low regime (~30-40 units/week). Period 38 demand was 32. The current on-hand inventory is 11 units. The critical issue remains the massive 'In-transit' figure of 1,557 units, which consists almost entirely of 'phantom pipeline' (lost orders). Confirmed lost orders include P1 (178), P3 (107), P4 (77), P13 (189), P14 (109), P17 (294), and P19 (450), totaling 1,404 units. Additionally, the P36 order (85 units) is now 3 periods old and has not arrived, making it a candidate for loss. To allow the OR engine to place any necessary orders, I must use 'explicit' inflation for 'mu_hat' to counteract the ~1,500 units it subtracts for pipeline. Target on-hand safety is approx 150 units (~4 weeks coverage). With 11 on-hand, I want the system to order ~130-150 units. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1,700 (1,557 phantom + 143 targeted stock).

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative phantom inventory (lost orders P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19) confirmed at 1,404 units. P36 order (85 units) is 3 periods old and monitored for loss. Demand is stable in a low-seasonal regime of 30-40 units/week.

=== Period 39 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $-78.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a seasonal trough, with the most recent demand in Period 39 being exceptionally low (9 units). Over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), the average demand is approximately 27 units, significantly lower than the ~40 units observed previously. On-hand inventory is 87 units, which covers more than 3 weeks of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1604 units is largely comprised of historical lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). The only 'live' orders are from P38 (68 units) and P39 (132 units). Due to the high volume of phantom inventory in the pipeline, the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic will calculate a negative order unless mu_hat is significantly inflated. I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover the phantom inventory (~1400 units) plus a small safety buffer for current seasonal demand, ensuring the system doesn't trigger unnecessary orders while on-hand inventory is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Current demand regime has softened further to ~25-30 units/week (P35-P39 average 26.6). Total phantom inventory (lost orders remaining in-transit) remains at 1,404 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-63.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) has entered a seasonal low, with the P35-P40 average dropping to ~24 units per week, and the most recent two weeks showing very low demand (9 and 12 units). On-hand inventory is currently at 75 units, which provides approximately 3 periods of coverage at the current mean. However, the system faces a significant 'phantom' inventory issue: 'In-transit' is 1604 units, while our tracking indicates 1404 units are lost (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). The real pipeline contains only P38 (68 units) and P39 (132 units). The OR backend's capped policy will subtract the full 1604 units from any base stock calculation, effectively blocking all new orders. To allow the backend to potentially place orders if demand spikes (given profit=1, holding=1, service level should be 50%), mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset the 1404 phantom units. I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~25 units/week over L+1 periods (2+1) plus the 1404 phantom offset: (25 * 3) + 1404 \u2248 1479. L is set to calculate to reflect the recent volatility (2-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand trough confirmed at ~25 units/week (November low). 1404 units of cumulative phantom inventory (lost orders P1-P19) remain in-transit, requiring mu_hat inflation of ~1400 units to allow for replenishment logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-173.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the feminine short-sleeved top has reached its seasonal trough, with demand in the last three periods falling to 9, 12, and 17 units (average ~13). The current on-hand inventory is 190 units, which covers approximately 14 weeks of demand at the current rate. Inventory is significantly over-stocked for the current demand regime. The 'In-transit' count of 1472 units is predominantly 'phantom' inventory from lost historical orders (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, and P36/P38 are suspected lost or already accounted for in earlier logic). Lead times for successful deliveries (P36, P39) have been 2-3 periods. Given the high on-hand stock and low demand, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to 'default' to allow the backend to use the long-term sample mean, which, even without inflation, will not trigger an order due to the high on-hand balance and the naturally higher base stock relative to current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime reaches seasonal trough in November: 3-period average is 12.6 units/week. On-hand inventory (190) is now excessive, providing ~14 weeks of coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-106.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is entering December (Date: 2019/12/2), typically a period of extreme low demand for short-sleeved t-shirts. Recent demand (P40-P42: 12, 17, 42) reflects this seasonal trough, with an average of ~24 units/week. Current on-hand inventory is 148 units, which provides over 6 weeks of cover at the current demand rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 1472 units is heavily skewed by 1,404 units of confirmed lost inventory (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19). Order P38 (68 units) is still in the valid lead-time window (2-3 periods). Because the OR engine subtracts the 1472 pipeline units from the base stock, it will not place any orders unless mu_hat is inflated. However, given the high on-hand stock and the seasonality, no new orders are desired. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand regime (~24 units/week over L+1) to ensure the system remains in a 'no-order' state while holding costs are minimized.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Seasonal t-shirt demand trough continues in December. On-hand inventory of 148 units provides sufficient coverage (~6 weeks). Phantom inventory remains 1,404 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Dec 9, 2019. Demand for this short-sleeved jersey top has hit its seasonal trough, with recent weekly demands of 17, 42, and 12 units (averaging ~23.7 units/week). Current on-hand inventory is 136 units, which at the current demand rate provides nearly 6 weeks of coverage. The 'In-transit' count of 1472 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, and likely P38), which the OR backend treats as valid pipeline inventory. However, given the high on-hand coverage relative to the low December demand, no new orders are required. mu_hat is set to a value that reflects the current low demand regime (~24 units/week) multiplied by (1+L), and sigma_hat reflects recent low volatility. Even without explicit mu_hat inflation to offset the phantom inventory, the system will correctly not order due to the high on-hand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Seasonal trough in December confirmed with demand averaging ~24 units/week. On-hand inventory (136) is sufficient for the remainder of the game (ending P47). Phantom inventory (lost orders remaining in-transit) remains at approx. 1472 units.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 out of 47. The current demand for this SKU (Womens Everyday Basics T-shirt) is in a deep seasonal trough, consistent with mid-December. The 5-period demand average (P40-P44) is 18 units/week. With an on-hand inventory of 129 units and only 3 periods remaining in the simulation, we have sufficient stock to cover all remaining demand even if it rebounds slightly. No further orders should be placed to avoid excess holding costs at the end of the game. The 'In-transit' figure remains heavily distorted by 1,472 units of confirmed lost shipments (P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, and P38 which is now 7 periods old). To ensure the OR backend does not place an order (as it would subtract this phantom in-transit inventory from the base stock), I am keeping mu_hat at its default level since the current on-hand already exceeds the estimated requirements for the final few periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 47, specifically December 23rd. The product is a short-sleeved t-shirt, which is currently in its deep seasonal trough. Recent demand (P43-P45) has been 12, 7, and 19 units, averaging ~12.7 units per week. The current on-hand inventory is 110 units. Given that there is only one period remaining in the game after this decision (P47), the 110 units on-hand provide more than enough coverage to satisfy the remaining demand. Any further orders would incur unnecessary holding costs without contributing to sales. The 'In-transit' count of 1472 units is largely comprised of historical lost shipments (Orders from P1, P3, P4, P13, P14, P17, P19, etc.), which we have successfully managed by inflating mu_hat in previous periods to force replenishment. However, at this stage of the game, replenishment is no longer required. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the current low-demand environment, which will result in a base stock level significantly below our current on-hand + pipeline levels, naturally resulting in zero new orders.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47, the final period of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 86 units. Demand over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has averaged approximately 20.8 units per week (42, 12, 7, 19, 24). With only one period remaining to satisfy demand and no further opportunities to receive or sell inventory beyond this period, the current on-hand inventory of 86 is more than sufficient to cover expected demand. Furthermore, the 'In-transit' figure of 1472 units is almost entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments from earlier in the year (P1, P3, P4, etc.), which has been a consistent distortion throughout the game. Since any order placed now would not arrive until after the game ends (promised lead time 2), and current stock is ample, no additional ordering is required. Parameters are set to maintain the current state without triggering unnecessary orders or holding costs.
