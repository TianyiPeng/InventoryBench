There is a clear downward trend in the recent three weeks, dropping from ~250 range to ~100 range. Current demand average is 160.4 units, but the most recent 3-week average is 101.6 units. OR Analysis: The OR recommendation of 295 units is based on the full 5-week history (average 160) and a z* factor for safety stock. My Safety Stock calculation: Given the downward trend, the OR recommendation is likely too high as it overweights the high January demand peaks. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at the recent average of ~100/week, I need roughly 300 units in the pipeline. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Strategy: Since this is the first period and I have no on-hand inventory, I must order to build stock.

Historical demand (Jan/Feb) showed an initial high average (Jan 7-14) of ~248 units, which then stabilized significantly lower (~81-112) in recent weeks. Current demand at P1 and P2 (82, 102) confirms this lower stabilized regime of ~92 units/period.\n\nLead-Time Inference: Promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in P1 (260 units) are expected to arrive during P3's resolution phase (visible in P4 start). P2's order (279) is expected in P4 (visible in P5). Currently, no shipments are confirmed lost.\n\nInventory & OR Recommendation: On-hand is 0, resulting in stockouts for P1 and P2 (184 units of lost sales). Pipeline is 539 (P1 + P2 orders). The OR recommendation of 97 reflects the recent lower demand trend and attempts to maintain a base stock for (L+1)=3 periods. Total inventory needed to cover 3 periods at the current mean (~92) plus safety stock is approximately 350-400 units. Since 539 units are already in-transit and expected to arrive in the next two periods, the pipeline is more than sufficient to cover immediate needs.

Demand Analysis: The historical data and recent concluded periods show a clear downward shift. Early January demand was high (~250), but the most recent five weeks (Feb 4 to Feb 25) show demand stabilized around 81-102 (mean ~91). This confirms the carry-over insight of a lower demand regime. Lead Time Check: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The P1 order was placed in P1 and is expected to arrive during P3's resolution, becoming visible in P4's starting status. However, P3 conclude shows 0 units arrived. This suggests the lead time is either \u22653 periods or the P1 order is delayed/lost. Strategy: The pipeline (636 units) already covers roughly 7 weeks of current demand (~91/week). Even if P1 is lost, P2 and P3 (376 units) cover ~4 weeks.

The mean of the last 5 periods is ~78, but the recent trend (66, 52) suggests a further softening into mid-March.

However, OR counts all 'In-transit' items (407 units) against its target, which would normally result in a zero order.

However, Period 1 (260 units) and Period 3 (97 units) have not arrived and are significantly past due; they must be treated as lost. Period 2 arrived on time (LT=2). The supply chain currently shows volatility (LT varying between 1 and 2 periods, with high loss rates). \n2. **Inventory & Pipeline**: Current on-hand is 0. Total in-transit is 445 units, but 357 are the lost P1 and P3 orders. Actual effective pipeline is only the Period 8 order (88 units), expected to arrive between P9 and P10. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand for this 'Noa skinny trouser' showed a drop in Feb, but the last two periods (P7-P8) have seen a bounce-back to ~83-90 units, likely due to spring seasonality (early April). The OR mean estimate (approx. 110-120) is likely too high because it includes very early Jan data, but its current recommendation of 67 is based on the inflated pipeline (it sees 445 units in-transit). \n4. **Strategy**: Since I have 0 on-hand and the only viable incoming shipment is 88 units (arriving P9 or P10), I need to order to cover demand for P9, P10, and P11. With recent demand averaging ~85, the OR recommendation of 67 is too low because it doesn't account for the fact that ~80% of the 'In-transit' quantity is lost. I will increase the order to 110 units to rebuild a safety buffer and prevent further stockouts given the recent demand recovery.",

The P8 order should arrive this period (P10) given L=2, and P9 should arrive in P11.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical samples showed ~112-256 in Jan. Feb/Mar saw a drop to ~50-80. April (P7-P9) has shown a recovery (83, 90, 60), averaging ~78. Being 'Noa skinny trouser' (womens tailoring), demand likely stays steady or increases through spring.\n4. Strategy: OR suggests 0 because it likely sees 555 'In-transit'. Discounting lost shipments, our true pipeline is 198. With demand at ~80/period, we need to cover P10, P11, and P12 (3 periods = 240 units). Current pipeline (198) leaves a gap of ~42 units.

Current On-hand is 38. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~15-18 units/period (average over P20-P24 is ~12.6). To cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand at ~15 units/period, we need ~45 units.

Demand Analysis: Demand has dropped significantly from early-year levels, stabilizing at approximately 18 units/period since Period 20.

Subtracting these lost units from the total in-transit of 507 leaves a realistic pipeline of 15 units (though these were not explicitly ordered in recent history, likely reflecting a data correction or minor drift). Given the current on-hand of 29 units covers approximately two periods of demand (at ~15 units/period), and the OR recommendation is 0, I will order a small amount (10 units) to maintain a buffer, as the pipeline is almost entirely composed of lost shipments and I want to avoid a stockout if demand recovers slightly for late August.",

Current on-hand inventory is 40 units. The pipeline of 1007 units is heavily contaminated by lost shipments (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P29, and P34), totaling 1007 units exactly (260+279+97+85+25+40+300+200 - note P2 and P20-23/27-28/30-31/32/33/35 arrived). Wait, recalculating lost units: P1(260), P3(97), P10(85), P17(25), P19(40), P29(300), P34(200). Sum = 1007. This matches the 'In-transit' exactly, meaning there are ZERO reliable units in the pipeline. With lead time (L) generally 2 periods, I must cover demand for the current period and the next two (P42, P43, P44). At an average of 50 units/period, total needs are ~150 units. My current on-hand is 40. I will order 110 units to cover this gap. The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored because it incorrectly counts those 1007 lost units as valid inventory.",

The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically flawed because it treats the massive volume of lost shipments as valid incoming inventory. Given the current demand spike and the fact that we have zero units to sell this period, I must order to cover the (L+1) horizon. Calculating requirements for P44 and P45: with demand around 150-180 units/period, we need roughly 450-500 units total.

Demand Analysis: We are in a holiday seasonal peak (Dec). Demand in P42 was 182 units and P43 was 98 units (weighted by stockouts). We expect elevated demand (~120-150 units/period) for the remaining 3 periods of the game. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Reliable pipeline includes P42 (110 units) and P43 (350 units), totaling 460 units. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it includes the 1007 lost units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. Excluding those, the effective pipeline is 460 units. Expected demand for P44-P46 (until game end) is roughly 400-450 units. Since 460 units are already in transit from recent reliable orders (P42, P43), and the game ends in Period 47, additional orders would likely arrive too late to be useful or would incur excessive holding costs at the end.

The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 145 units. Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The total 'In-transit' of 1567 units is highly misleading as history confirms 1007 units are lost from older periods (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P29, P34). The reliable pipeline consists only of orders placed in P42 (110 units), P43 (350 units), and P44 (100 units). Based on lead-time mechanics, the P42 order (expected lead time 2) should arrive during P44's resolution and the P43 order (350 units) during P45's resolution. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 units, likely because it misinterprets the massive (mostly lost) in-transit total as available stock. However, since the P43 order of 350 units is scheduled to arrive during this period (P45) and the P44 order (100 units) in P46, we have 450 reliable units incoming to cover the final two periods of the game (P46, P47).

Evaluating the pipeline: total in-transit is 1107 units, but 1007 units are confirmed lost shipments across multiple periods (P1, P3, P10, P17, P19, P29, P34). The only reliable order in the pipeline is from Period 44 (100 units), which is expected to arrive during Period 46 or 47 (based on the current observed lead time of 2-3 periods). Total reliable inventory (on-hand 327 + reliable in-transit 100) is 427 units. At a demand rate of ~140 units/period, this covers roughly 3 periods of demand (P46, P47, P48).
