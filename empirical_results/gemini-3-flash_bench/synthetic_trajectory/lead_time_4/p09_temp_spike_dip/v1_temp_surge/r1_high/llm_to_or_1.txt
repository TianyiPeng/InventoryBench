Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the available 5 periods shows an average of 114.4 units per period (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit shipments yet, and we have no historical lead time arrivals to calculate an actual lead time, I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 available samples to establish a baseline forecast. The OR backend will compute the base stock based on the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), which aligns with our data. No regime shifts or seasonal signals are yet detectable in this small sample.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we placed an order for 141 units, which is currently in-transit. Because 'arrived=0' is expected for a lead time of 4 (the arrival will occur in early Period 5 and be visible in Period 6 context), there is no evidence of lead time deviation yet. The demand in Period 1 was 86 units, which is slightly below the pre-game sample average (114.4). Since we start with 0 on-hand inventory and the first order won't arrive until Period 5, we are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0 in Period 1). For the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' (4) as no actual lead time data is yet available to contradict the promise. 2) mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (incorporating the 5 pre-game samples plus P1 data) to provide a stable demand estimate for the coverage period (1+L=5). 3) sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture historical volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover demand until the lead time cycle completes.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', we have an on-hand inventory of 0 and a total in-transit of 274 units (141 ordered in P1, 133 ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since P1 and P2 concluded without arrivals, this is consistent with the promised lead time (orders from P1 are expected to arrive in Period 5). Historical demand samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106]. Recent demand performance in the game (P1=86, P2=132) averages 109, which aligns well with the pre-game samples (mean = 114.4). There is no yet observed evidence of lead-time drift or a confirmed demand shift, so I will use a balanced window of the last 5 samples (N=5) for the demand forecast and the default lead-time settings. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus one period (L+1=5).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase, which we will only observe in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. This is expected given L=4. In-transit inventory is 418 units (141 from P1, 133 from P2, 144 from P3). Historical demand for Regular Chips shows a mean of 114.4 units across the first 5 sample periods (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) and a mean of 106 units across the concluded periods (86, 132, 100). The seasonality for chips is generally stable unless near a holiday. Since we have no specific calendar dates, I will use all available sample data. I'll stick to the promised lead time (L=4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-4 are expected and do not indicate a lead time shift or lost orders yet. My current on-hand inventory is 0 and I have 559 units in transit (141+133+144+141). Historical demand samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106], with a mean of 114.4 and a standard deviation of 15.6. Since the demand shows no clear trend or regime shift yet, I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (which use all samples) and stick to the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1979.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. Analysis of Period 5 conclude confirms that the order placed in Period 1 arrived exactly 4 periods later (arrived Period 5), matching the promised lead time. Demand across the first 5 periods has been [131, 92, 118, 125, 106] based on the historical seed data given, while the game history shows slightly different realized demands [86, 132, 100, 75, 106]. Averaging the realized demand from the game history (P1-P5) gives a mean of 99.8 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 35, and we have 471 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The OR backend uses mu_hat as (1+L)*mean; I will use the 'default' method to calculate mean and std across all 5 available samples, as there is no clear evidence of a regime shift yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1372.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (based on P1 order arriving P5 and P2 order arriving P6). Current on-hand inventory is 91. In-transit inventory is 439 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with an average around 107 units per period based on the 6 observed data points (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77) and the 5 pre-game samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106). Since we have no specific calendar dates or product seasonality indicators, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 (all available data points including pre-game) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a stable forecast. The pipeline inventory (on-hand 91 + in-transit 439 = 530) covers nearly 5 periods of average demand (approx 107 * 5 = 535), which is appropriate for a lead time of 4. I will maintain L=4.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The confirmed lead time from 'Period 5 conclude', 'Period 6 conclude', and 'Period 7 conclude' is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). In-transit inventory (363 units) consists of orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7. The demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial historical samples. Historical demand was: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106. Since the game started, demand has been: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67. There is a perceptible downward trend or shift starting around Period 4/5. The average of the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 81.25. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 captures this lower demand regime better than the full history, helping to avoid over-ordering given the currently high on-hand (168) and in-transit (363) quantities, which already cover more than 6 periods of recent average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2231.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). On-hand inventory is 182 units, and in-transit inventory is 222 units (orders from P5, P6, P7). The order from P5 (53 units) is expected to arrive during Period 9. Total demand over the last 8 periods is: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, averaging 96.25. Demand remains relatively stable with no clear seasonal trend identifiable from the generic 'Period_X' markers. Current pipeline (182 on-hand + 222 in-transit = 404) is meant to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With an average demand of ~96, 5 periods requirement is approx 480 units. We are slightly under-stocked relative to the 5-period target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full demand history while excluding the initial empty inventory periods for demand estimation. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1965.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical data (Periods 1-9 plus provided initial samples) shows demand is relatively stable, fluctuating around a mean of approximately 107 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9. Currently, on-hand inventory is 125 units with 306 units in-transit. The OR backend uses the formula (1+L) * mean_demand to set the base stock level. With L=4, it targets 5 periods of demand. Since there is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonal trend in the provided data yet, I will use a balanced window (recent_N=10) to capture current demand characteristics while ignoring the zero-sales periods at the start (which were caused by lack of inventory, not lack of demand). This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the actual demand observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1934.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have observed a stable pattern in both demand and lead time. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods for all 6 completed order cycles (P1-P6). Demand has been relatively stable; across the 10 concluded periods, the mean demand is 98.8, with a standard deviation of 22.3. Recent demand (last 6 periods) is slightly higher (98.2) than the initial 4-period mean (98.3), but there is no evidence of a regime shift. Currently, we have 118 units on hand and 340 units in transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). The order from P7 (68 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock targets (L+1) periods of demand. Using the default method for L (promised = 4) and recent_N=10 for demand statistics provides a stable forecast to balance the service level against holding costs. The in-transit pipeline (340) plus current on-hand (118) is 458, which comfortably covers the expected demand over the next 5 periods.

Current Period is 12. Analysis of the game history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as observed in every delivery from Period 5 to Period 11). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable over the 11 periods of history, with observations ranging from 67 to 132 units. The mean demand across all 11 periods is approximately 101.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. In-transit inventory is currently high (390 units) due to orders placed in Periods 8-11. On-hand inventory is 61 units. Since the lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical data (N=11) to capture the overall demand profile, as there is no evidence of a recent regime shift or seasonality in the provided data.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we sold out (on-hand 0) because the order from Period 8 did not arrive as expected. While the promised lead time is 4, recent history (Periods 5-11) showed a consistent lead time of 4. However, the order from Period 8 (0 units) wouldn't help inventory, but the order from Period 9 (137 units) should arrive during Period 13 (visible in P14). I currently have 528 units in-transit (Orders from P9, P10, P11, P12). The demand has been relatively stable, averaging around 102 units over the last 12 periods. The most recent demand (132) is higher than average but within range. Given we are at zero on-hand, I will use a larger N for demand estimation to capture the volatility and ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the lead time (4) plus the execution period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. I'll maintain L at the promised value of 4 since arrivals have been tracking that lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2103.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the order from Period 8 (expected arrival in Period 12 conclude, read in Period 13) never arrived. The Period 9 order arrived on time (Period 13 conclude). This confirms that the order for Period 8 (arrived=0 in Period 12 conclude) is most likely a lost shipment. Our lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 9 order in Period 13. Demand over the last 13 periods has averaged approximately 105 units. With on-hand inventory at 25 and 467 units in-transit, we need to maintain a steady flow to cover the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) which requires roughly 525 units of pipeline inventory. Since the backend OR logic subtracts in-transit from the calculated base stock, and we suspect a lost shipment from P8, we will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture recent volatility and 'explicit' lead time to ensure the calculation accounts for the 4-period duration reliably. The lost shipment from Period 8 is handled by the OR engine seeing a lower 'pipeline_inventory' in its own calculation, leading to a recovery order.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Confirmed loss of Period 8 shipment (expected Period 12, P9 arrived on schedule in P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory includes 62 units on-hand and 444 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, although the Period 8 shipment was confirmed lost in Period 14. Demand shows no significant seasonal or regime shifts, with the last 14 periods of demand averaging approximately 105.5 units. The target service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95. As the inventory system is recovering from the lost Period 8 shipment and associated stockout in Period 12, I will use recent_N (N=14) for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the most accurate current operational variance while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 1+4=5 period risk horizon.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 66 units on-hand and 419 units in-transit. History confirms a stable lead time (L) of 4 periods, with the exception of the Period 8 order which is confirmed lost. Since L=4 is reliable, I am using the 'default' method for L. Demand has remained relatively stable; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P6-P15) is approximately 107.1 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture this recent average, which scales to (1+4)*107.1 = 535.5 units for the protection interval. Similarly, for sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility. This setup ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand while accounting for the current pipeline (419 units) and on-hand inventory (66 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3696.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system has 9 units on-hand and 409 units in-transit. Based on 'conclude' messages, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). The shipment from Period 8 is confirmed lost. Since L=4, the order placed in P13 is expected to arrive during P17 (after this decision). Demand in P16 spiked to 195 units, significantly higher than the previous mean of ~108. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or a one-off spike (e.g., a holiday or event). Given the low stock (9 units), I must protect against a sustained increase. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent spike more heavily without overreacting to a single data point. The service level target is high (95%) because profit ($19) is much larger than holding cost ($1). Setting L to 4 manually ensures the backend accounts for the correct pipeline window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started at Period 16: demand spiked from avg 108 to 195 (+80%).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Current on-hand inventory is 0. A significant demand regime shift began at Period 16, with demand jumping from an average of ~110 to 195 in P16 and 251 in P17 (avg ~223 over last 2 periods). I am forecasting demand to remain at this higher level. The carry-over insights confirm the actual lead time is 4 periods. Since P17 demand (251) significantly exceeded the starting on-hand (85), we are currently stocked out. In-transit inventory is 527 (Orders from P14, P15, P16, P17). The order from P14 (112 units) is expected to arrive during P18. To account for the new demand level (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the spike (P16, P17, plus the baseline shift) and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~110 to ~223 (+100%) starting Period 16. Stockout occurred in Period 17 due to this sudden spike.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Demand for Period 16-18 was 195, 251, and 189 respectively, averaging 211.7 units. The previous regime average was approximately 108 units. This sudden 100% increase led to stockouts in Period 17 and 18 because the pipeline inventory (ordered when demand was lower) was insufficient. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent arrivals (P12 order arrived P16, P13 arrived P17, P14 arrived P18). To recover and avoid further stockouts, we must set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on this new regime. I am using recent_N with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture only the data since Period 16. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed 4-period lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 195, 251, 189, and 177, averaging 203 units per period. This is nearly double the previous average of ~110. Due to this sudden spike and the fixed 4-period lead time, we are currently experiencing stockouts (On-hand: 0). The pipeline is significant (890 units), but we must ensure future orders are sized for this new regime (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have 4 periods of data for this new regime, I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current volatility and volume. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2432.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to 20: 195, 251, 189, 177, 254. The average demand during this 5-period window is 213.2 units per period, compared to the pre-shift average of approximately 108 units (+97%). A stockout has occurred from Period 17 through 20 because the pipeline was still delivering quantities based on the old regime (approx. 110 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the Period 16 order (arrived Period 20, lead time 4). Since the shift is confirmed and sustained over 5 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 demand samples (N=5) and sigma_hat using the same window (N=5) to capture the increased volatility of the higher demand level. L is set to calculate as there is no evidence of further lead-time drift since the Period 8 loss.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-20 average demand is 213 units (vs 108 pre-shift), a 97% increase. Continuous stockouts from Period 17-20 due to slow pipeline adjustment.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the mean demand is approximately 217 units (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238), which is a clear 100% increase over the baseline of ~108. Despite the arrival of 194 units in Period 21, the system remains in a stockout state (ending on-hand 0) because demand (238) exceeded supply. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover and prevent further stockouts, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods and mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the high-demand regime. This will raise the base stock level to cover the increased demand over the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility observed in this new regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 7 periods (Periods 16-22), the mean demand is 222 units (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250), compared to the pre-shift average of approximately 110 units. This represents a sustained 100% increase in demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with orders arriving exactly 4 periods after being placed (e.g., Period 18 order arrived in Period 22). Current inventory status shows on-hand inventory of 50 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 913 units (orders from P19, P20, P21, P22). To ensure the OR backend reacts to the new demand level while accurately reflecting the stable lead time, I will set L to 4 (default), mu_hat using the recent 7-period mean to capture the higher demand regime, and sigma_hat using the same recent window to capture the increased volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~110 to ~213. Recent demand (Periods 16-23: 195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250, 184) confirms this higher level remains stable, with an eight-period average of 217 units. Stockouts occurred between Periods 17 and 21 but have been resolved as larger orders from the high-demand period (P18 onwards) began arriving. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have 8 consistent samples of the new regime, I will use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. The on-hand inventory is now 134 and in-transit is 916 (which reflects the large orders placed recently), enough to cover the lead time pipeline given the new demand average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 16-23 average demand is 217 units, confirming a permanent shift from the pre-Period 16 average of 108.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of ~110 units to ~217 units (+97%). Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is 219.5, and the standard deviation is approximately 32.5. We are now in a post-shift stabilized phase. Specifically, the last 3 periods show demand of 250, 184, and 238, averaging 224. To prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the full scope of the high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P20 order arrived P24). The inventory position (On-hand: 142 + In-transit: 831 = 973) is being closely monitored against a target base stock of approximately (1+4) * 220 = 1100 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of ~110 to ~215 units. For Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 164 with 882 units in transit. Recent demand (Periods 16-25) has averaged 215.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. To stabilize the inventory level following several periodic stockouts and the subsequent recovery, I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals (Periods 21-25) following the Period 8 loss. Setting L to 'calculate' effectively uses the historical average of 4. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the new higher mean (~215 * 5 = 1075) while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1530.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~108 to ~213. However, in the most recent periods (P23-P26), demand has shown signs of cooling or high volatility (184, 238, 171, 95). Demand in Period 26 was particularly low (95). To avoid over-ordering during this potential transition or stabilization phase while maintaining high service levels (critical given the high profit/holding cost ratio of 19:1), I am using a recent window of 11 periods (P16 to P26) to capture the high-demand regime's mean while allowing the most recent lower observations to weight the average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 275, but with a lead time of 4, we must ensure the pipeline covers total demand for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased post-Period 23: while the P16-P22 average was ~222, the P23-P26 average dropped to ~172, with a significantly low observation of 95 in P26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1134.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a stable period of ~108 units (P1-P15) and a massive spike to ~217 units (P16-P23), the most recent four periods (P24-P27) show a sharp decline: 238, 171, 95, 84. The average demand across these last four periods is 147, and the last two periods averaged only 89.5. This suggests the high-demand phase has ended, returning toward or even below the original baseline. Currently, we have 462 units on-hand and 652 in-transit, which is excessive if demand remains below 100. To prevent significant holding costs, I am adjusting mu_hat downwards using recent_N=4 to capture this cooling trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed at Period 27: Average demand for P24-P27 dropped to 147 units, with the most recent two periods (P26-P27) averaging 89.5 units, signaling an end to the P16-P23 high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1797.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downward starting around Period 26-27. The high-demand period (P16-P25) averaged ~213 units, whereas the last three periods (P26-P28) averaged 100 units (95, 84, 121). This return to baseline (similar to P1-P15 average of 106) necessitates a reduction in \u03bc\u0302. Also, current inventory levels are high: On-hand (502) + Pipeline (491) = 993 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods. If demand is ~100/period, we need ~500 units; if it's the P16-P25 average of ~200, we need ~1000 units. Since inventory is already near 1000 and demand is trending significantly lower, I will set mu_hat to be more responsive to recent data (N=5 covers the peak-to-trough transition) and lean on the backend's capped policy to prevent over-ordering while on-hand is high. Sigma_hat remains on a small N to capture the increased volatility of the shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: P26-P28 average demand is 100 units, returning to pre-P16 baseline levels.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly returned to its pre-Period 16 baseline. After a major spike (approx. 220 units/period) between Period 16 and Period 25, the demand in the last four periods (P26-P29) has been 95, 84, 121, and 98, averaging 99.5 units. This confirms the downward shift noted in previous insights. Current on-hand inventory is high (648 units) and there is a significant pipeline (247 units in transit from orders in P26 and P27), while the backend is already capping orders at 0 due to the high inventory-to-demand ratio. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to reflect this lower, stable demand regime (P26-P29). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to allow the high on-hand inventory to deplete naturally while preventing unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward firmly established: P26-P29 average demand is 99.5 units, matching the historical baseline and ending the high-demand phase seen in P16-P25.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly returned to its baseline state. Following the high-demand period (P16-P25 where demand averaged ~220), the demand has significantly dropped. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand has been 95, 84, 121, 98, and 117, averaging 103 units, which is consistent with the pre-spike average of 108. On-hand inventory is currently very high (685 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P22-P26 orders arriving). With 685 units on hand and 93 in-transit, we have enough stock to cover roughly 7 periods of baseline demand. The OR backend needs to be informed of this lower demand regime to avoid further over-ordering while we bleed off the excess inventory. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this stabilized lower regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its historical baseline of approximately 100-110 units per period following a high-demand phase between Periods 16-25. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is 103.6 units (95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107). Currently, the inventory position is very high: on-hand inventory is 671 units with no outstanding units in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, a base stock level calculation for L=4 and mu=110 would be roughly 550 units ((1+4)*110). Since on-hand (671) already exceeds the required safety levels for the current demand regime, the OR backend will correctly continue to place zero orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current stable low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'default' for L as the observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its historical baseline following a significant high-demand phase (P16-P25). For the last seven periods (P26-P32), demand has averaged 104.8 units, which is consistent with the pre-P16 average of approximately 108. The current on-hand inventory is 559 units, with no units in transit. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~105, we need approximately 525 units. Since we have 559 units on hand, we are currently overstocked and do not need to place additional orders. The OR backend will naturally suppress ordering because the base stock (approx 525-600) is lower than the current pipeline inventory (559). I will use recent_N for both mu and sigma to capture this stabilized lower regime (N=7 to cover P26-P32). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled back to its historical baseline of approximately 100-110 units per period following a high-demand spike between Periods 16-25. The most recent eight periods (P26-P33) show an average demand of 104.5 units (95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112, 102), confirming this stabilization. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory levels are very high (On-hand: 457) due to over-ordering during the transition from the high-demand regime, while the required base stock for the current regime (targeting roughly 5*105 = 525 units) is nearly covered by on-hand stock alone. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized baseline volatility and mean. The OR backend will likely order zero or very small amounts until the excess inventory is depleted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~105 units/period: Average demand from P26-P33 is 104.5 units, confirming a return to pre-P16 levels.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units following a significant downward shift starting at Period 26, effectively returning to the pre-Period 16 baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 377 units with 111 units in transit, totaling 488 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4 periods, this inventory covers approximately 4.6 periods of demand (488 / 105). Since our target base stock should cover L+1 (5) periods, and we are currently at a high on-hand levels, the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering until inventory reaches target levels. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (Periods 26-34) to specifically capture the current stable demand regime and filter out the high-demand volatility from the P16-P25 period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime (~105 units/period) after the high-demand phase (P16-P25). Recent demand from P30 to P35 has averaged 106.8 units (117, 107, 112, 102, 80, 122). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 255 units, and in-transit is 184 units (ordered in P33, P34, P35). Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At ~105 units/period, target inventory is roughly 525 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 439 units. We use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 26 while excluding the outlier high-demand period. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the current mean and historical volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units following the high-demand regime (P16-P25). Analysis of the last 11 periods (P26-P36) shows a stable average demand of 102.8 units with moderate variance. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 164 units with 313 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, P36). Using a recent_N approach with N=11 captures the current post-shift regime precisely. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the (L+1) period risk window (approx 525 units) while accounting for the existing pipeline, ensuring high service levels without excessive holding costs as the old surplus inventory drains.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at its historical baseline after a temporary high-demand phase (P16-P25). Average demand since the stabilization point (P26) is approximately 101 units per period. The recent observation of 55 units in P37 is slightly below the recent average but within expected volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P33 order in P37. Inventory management is now transitioning from clearing excess stock (P28-P32) to maintaining the new baseline. With on-hand inventory at 123 and in-transit at 389 units (mostly ordered between P34-P37), the total pipeline covers the expected lead time demand. I will use recent_N (N=12, covering P26-P37) to capture this post-spike regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the promised lead time (L=4).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline of ~105 units following a significant high-demand regime between Periods 16-25. Since Period 26, the demand mean has consistently returned to pre-spike levels. The latest 10 periods (P29-P38) show an average demand of approximately 101.6 units with moderate volatility. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37 and the Period 34 order in Period 38. With on-hand inventory at 88 and 346 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use a recent_N (N=13) to capture the demand behavior since the post-spike stabilization (starting P26) to provide a localized mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) for a lead time (L) of 4. This N is chosen to include all data points since the downward shift stabilized.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units following a significant upward spike (P16-P25) and subsequent return to baseline (from P26 onwards). Since Period 26, the average demand is 101.4 units. Period 39 demand was 81 units, and the current on-hand inventory is 80 units with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 409 units. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P33, P34, and P35 orders arriving on schedule in P37, P38, and P39). To calculate OR parameters, I am using a recent window of 14 periods (P26-P39) to capture the current stable regime and exclude the high-demand distortion. This yields a mean of ~101 and a standard deviation reflecting the current level of volatility. Given the high in-transit amount compared to the 105-unit demand mean, the OR backend will likely moderate order sizes to avoid excessive holding costs.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units since Period 26.

On-hand inventory is 73 units, and with a pipeline of 367 units, we are well-positioned to meet upcoming demand. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) at the optimal service level dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around the 100-110 units/period range following the high-demand phase (P16-P25) and subsequent correction. From Period 34 to Period 41, the average demand is 105.1 units, which is consistent with the pre-P16 baseline. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (21 units), but the in-transit pipeline is substantial (416 units), covering several periods of future demand. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the stable period from P34 onwards), and using the promised/observed lead time of 4.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 105 units since Period 26, matching the pre-spike baseline. Recently, Period 42 saw a stockout with on-hand inventory hitting 0, though the pipeline is robust with 520 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 42. Since the high-demand regime is long over, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=17) to cover the stable period from Period 26 to the present (42-26 + 1 = 17). This will provide a reliable estimate of current demand while ignoring the historical spike, helping the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units per period since Period 26. Recent demand (P39-P43) shows a slight uptick with values of [81, 136, 142, 79, 122], averaging 112 units. This indicates the 105-unit baseline remains the most reliable anchor. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (14 units) following a stockout in P42 and a significant sale in P43, but a large pipeline of 467 units is in transit. These pipeline units (ordered between P40-P43: 87, 139, 158, 83) are expected to arrive in P44-P47. Specifically, the P40 order (87 units) arrives during P44's resolution phase. I will continue using the recent stable regime (N=18, covering P26-P43) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the return to baseline levels while acknowledging recent volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units following the downward shift confirmed after Period 26. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is 104.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P37-P44). Current on-hand inventory is low (36), but there is a significant pipeline of 506 units. However, looking at the backend logic, an order is necessary to maintain the base stock level considering the (L+1) period demand coverage. Using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current stabilized regime accurately while allowing the OR backend to balance the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units following a significant high-demand phase (P16-P25). Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is 100.3 units, confirming the baseline remains intact. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals in P43, P44, and P45). Currently, we have 84 units on hand and 455 in-transit. A pipeline of 455 units across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1=5) implies an average coverage of 91 units/period, which is slightly below the recent mean. However, looking at the in-transit schedule, orders from P42-P45 (158, 83, 126, 88) are significant. The backend OR will calculate the base stock. I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility (\u03bc \u2248 100, \u03c3 \u2248 30), allowing the engine to adjust the order to account for the pipeline and maintain the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units following the downward shift confirmed at Period 34. Recent demand (P41-P46) shows a mean of 104.16 and a standard deviation of 30.8, aligning with the historical baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P42 order in P46. With 116 units on-hand and 370 units in-transit (P43-P46 orders), the pipeline is well-positioned to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game. I will continue to use a 7-period window (recent_N=7) for demand and volatility to capture the current stable regime while maintaining sensitivity to minor fluctuations as the game nears conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1441.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units per period since Period 26. Looking at the last 15 periods (P33-P47), the mean demand is 100.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 28.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent observations (P33-P43 orders arrived exactly at L=4). Currently, On-hand inventory is 117 and Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 446, totaling 563 units. With a target base stock estimated for (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 5 * 105 = 525 plus safety stock), the current total inventory is sufficient. Using recent_N=15 captures the current stable regime while excluding the P16-P25 spike. This parameter set balances the high profit margin ($19.0) against holding costs ($1.0) by maintaining a high service level without over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1097.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline of ~105 units following a significant high-demand regime between Periods 16-25. Since Period 26, the demand mean has consistently hovered around 104 units with moderate volatility. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. As we are approaching Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, the primary goal is to maintain the service level while managing ending inventory. I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stable post-peak behavior (roughly Period 29-48). This covers the (L+1) period of demand required to ensure availability during the final segments of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1936.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units following the high-demand volatility seen between Periods 16-30. Recent demand (P44-P49) has been 65, 91, 126, 82, 67, 110, averaging 90.2 units. The broader window since P34 (when stabilization was first noted) shows an average of ~99 units. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, slightly lower demand level while maintaining enough history to account for the current variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the most recent arrivals (P45-P49). Total pipeline (On-hand 154 + In-transit 332 = 486) effectively covers roughly 4.8 periods of demand at current levels, which is appropriate for a 4-period lead time.
