The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to build up the pipeline to cover the (L+1) = 5 period lead time. The OR recommendation of 141 units is derived from a base-stock policy using historical mean and standard deviation, capped to smooth volatility. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0 each), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. However, since we have zero inventory currently and a 4-period lead time, we must place an order now to begin filling the pipeline.

The order of 141 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (based on the 4-period promise). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand in Period 1 was 86 units, which resulted in a stockout because no inventory was available. \n2. Demand Analysis: Historical samples are [131, 92, 118, 125, 106], averaging ~114. Period 1 actual demand was 86, which is lower than the average but still significant. \n3. OR Baseline: The OR agent recommends 140 units. This is based on a base-stock policy using the promised lead time (L=4) and historical mean. It calculates that to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods, we need roughly 114 * 5 = 570 units (plus safety stock). With 141 in-transit, the raw requirement is high, but the OR cap restricts the order to 140 to avoid over-ordering based on single-period variances. \n4. Adjustment: Since I have 0 on-hand and only 141 in the pipeline for a 4-period lead time, I am heavily under-stocked. However, because the lead time is long, orders placed now won't arrive until Period 6. I will follow the OR recommendation of 140 to build the pipeline steadily without exceeding the suggested safety cap, as the holding cost ($1) is equal to the profit ($1), making overstocking just as punishing as stockouts.",

Demand Shift: There is a clear regime shift. The initial 5-period avg was 114, but the last two periods averaged 223. The OR recommendation of 131 is based on the full history and is heavily capped, which is dangerous during this surge. 4. Strategy: I must cover demand for the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), totaling 5 periods. Using a conservative recent average of ~180-200, required stock is ~900-1000. Pipeline is 457. Current gap is ~443-543. Since the holding cost equals profit (1.0), overstocking is as bad as understocking. However, a stockout loses 100% of profit. I will order 148 to maintain the current elevated order pace and signal a need for higher stock levels despite the OR cap.",

Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 35 units. Total in-transit is 470 units. Total pipeline (35 + 470) = 505 units. \n3. Demand Analysis: The carry-over insights correctly identified a demand regime shift around P26-P28. Recent demand (P29-P36) has averaged 104 units (98, 117, 107, 112, 102, 80, 122, 91). Using this average, the pipeline (505 units) covers approximately 4.85 periods of demand. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 156 units. However, looking at the coverage, the 505 units currently in the system will last through P41 (given the 4-period lead time). If I order 156 units now (P37), they will arrive in P41. We need to maintain a continuous flow. The ending inventory in P37 will likely be near zero (on-hand 35 vs avg demand ~100), but a large arrival (200 units) is expected in P38. Total requirements for (L+1) = 5 periods at ~105 units/period is ~525 units. Since pipeline is 505, a small order is needed to top up. The OR recommendation of 156 seems slightly aggressive given the holding cost ($1) equals profit ($1), suggesting a target service level of 50% for optimal cost, but safely covering demand is preferred.

Demand Analysis: The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 26; recent demand averages approximately 100 units per period (last 10 periods avg: 98.5).

Strategy: We are currently in a transition where large orders placed after the inventory cleared (P34-P38) are beginning to arrive. The OR recommendation of 132 units is based on the current mean and standard deviation. However, the pipeline of 452 units is already very high relative to the ~100 unit/period demand. Adding 132 more units would bring the total supply (On-hand 68 + In-transit 452 + New Order 132) to 652 units, covering roughly 6.5 periods.

The order placed now (P46) would arrive at the start of Period 50. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~115 in the current regime (P28-P45 avg is ~104, with recent volatility). Total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is approximately 550-600 units. Our current inventory (449) is insufficient to cover this total. However, since P50 is the final period, any order placed now only services the very last period of demand. The OR recommendation of 183 units is too high given that we only have 4 calculation periods left after this one and the inventory must not just arrive but be sold to generate profit.

Current inventory status is 163 units on-hand with 280 units in-transit (80 from P43, 80 from P44, 0 from P45, 120 from P46). The current demand regime is approximately 110 units per period (post-P28 average). Since we are at Period 47 and the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P47) will arrive at the arrival resolution of Period 51 (47 + 4), which is AFTER the game has concluded. Therefore, any units ordered now will only incur procurement costs or simply not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the final score, while potentially increasing ending inventory if the system counts arrivals in the final period. However, since the lead time is 4, an order placed at P47 arrives at the start of P51. To maximize total reward (Profit * Sold - Holding * Ending Inventory), I should stop ordering now to bleed down the existing pipeline and on-hand inventory, as the current total supply (163 + 280 = 443) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 (estimated 110 * 4 = 440 units).",

Expected arrivals: P44 order (80 units) should arrive in P48 (visible in P49), and P46 order (120 units) should arrive in P50. Total inventory available to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50) is roughly 161 + 80 + 120 = 361 units. Given the current average demand of 110-120 units per period, this is sufficient to cover the rest of the game without incurring additional holding costs for units that will never arrive in time to be sold.
