Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data to infer the actual lead time, so I will use the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand history provided (Periods 1-5, though it's currently only Period 1 in the game) shows samples: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106. The mean of these 5 samples is 114.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 14.8. Since On-hand and In-transit are zero, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the variance from the provided samples, and 'default' for L (4 periods). The OR backend uses these to calculate base stock = (1+L) * mu + z * sqrt(1+L) * sigma. With L=4, mu=114.4, sigma=14.8, and z~0 (since Profit=Holding=$1.0, critical ratio = 0.5), base stock will be approximately 5 * 114.4 = 572.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 141 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect this to arrive until the end of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The initial demand in Period 1 was 46 units, which resulted in lost sales since starting on-hand was 0. The historical sample data provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) suggests a mean demand of approximately 114.4 units per period. The Period 1 demand of 46 units seems like an outlier or part of a different distribution than the pre-game samples, but one data point is not enough to confirm a regime shift. I will use the promised lead time of 4 and apply a 'recent_N' approach to demand forecasting, using N=5 to capture the provided pre-game history plus the new observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (141 units) and Period 2 (149 units) are currently in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. This explains the current 0 on-hand inventory and the resulting lost sales (demand was 46 in P1 and 131 in P2, but 0 units were sold). The total in-transit quantity is 290 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is 131, 92, 118, 125, 106, while the demand during the first two active periods was 46 and 131. The mean demand across all available observations (7 samples) is approximately 107. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4), and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data to establish a stable baseline while waiting for the initial pipeline to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 4 periods. Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 (141 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, we have seen 0 arrivals so far, which is consistent with the promised lead time. Our current inventory is 0, and we have 447 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand for the first three periods was 46, 131, and 87. Historical demand samples provided are 131, 92, 118, 125, and 106. The mean of these 5 samples is 114.4, with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the provided historical demand distribution, and keep L at default (4). Setting parameters this way helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the upcoming 5 periods while accounting for the observed volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 of a 50-period simulation. The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit/holding cost ratio of 1.0/1.0, suggesting a target service level of 50%. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 495 units in-transit (P1: 141, P2: 149, P3: 157, P4: 48). Total demand over the first 4 periods was 394 units, but all were lost sales due to zero stock. The historical samples provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) show a stable mean of roughly 114.4. Calculation for mu_hat (L=4): (1+4) * 114.4 = 572. Since we are just starting and the lead time is long, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the provided historical average while the first shipments are still in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the Period 1 order (141 units) arriving at the end of Period 5 (lead_time = 4). No demand data for Period 6 is available yet, but historical demand for periods 1-5 shows an average of (46+131+87+130+105)/5 = 99.8 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 36, with 359 units in transit (ordered in P2, P3, P4, P5). Demand has been relatively stable, with some variance. The high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) suggests we should avoid excessive stock (target service level q = 0.5). I will use the recent 5 samples for demand and standard deviation to capture the current variance while maintaining the promised lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Avg demand periods 1-5 is ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 14 units on hand. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been confirmed by the arrival of orders from Period 1 (arrived P5) and Period 2 (arrived P6). Demand in Period 6 spiked to 171 units, significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. Over the 6 periods, demand has been: 46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171. The mean of all 6 samples is ~111.6. Given the recent spike, I will monitor for a regime shift, but for now, I will use a slightly more responsive average. Choosing recent_N=5 for demand to capture the trend while smoothing the P1 outlier (46). For sigma, I will use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility seen in the last two periods. The pipeline (314 units) includes orders from P3 (157), P4 (48), P5 (5), and P6 (104). The P3 order is expected to arrive in Period 7 (visible P8). Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 8. Historical demand for periods 1-7 (46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171, 93) shows a mean of approximately 109 units with significant variance. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrivals of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3. On-hand inventory is 78 units, and we have significant in-transit inventory (334 units) comprising orders from Period 4 (48), 5 (5), 6 (104), and 7 (177). Since the lead time L=4 is stable and demand shows no clear regime shift yet (though P6 was high), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent history of demand while remaining responsive to the current trend. Calculating L is appropriate as observations consistently match the promised 4-period duration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the confirmed lead time is 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) shows a mean of 96.8, which is consistent with the initial estimate of ~100 units. Current on-hand inventory is 41 units, and there are 419 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). Specifically, the P5 order of 5 units is expected to arrive this period (P9), likely resulting in a low stock situation given the average demand of ~100. However, the subsequent in-transit quantities (104, 177, 133) are more substantial. To maintain the service level across the lead time + review period (1+4=5 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 (the full available history) to capture the overall demand mean and variance while respecting the confirmed lead time L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The 'Period 9 conclude' shows we stocked out (ending on-hand=0) because only 5 units arrived (from Period 5 order) against a demand of 100. Current in-transit is 484 units, which corresponds to orders from P6 (104), P7 (177), P8 (133), and P9 (70). The order from P6 should arrive during this period (P10) and be visible at the start of P11. Demand remains relatively stable. Recent demand (P5-P9) averages 109.8 units, while the full history (P1-P9) averages 107.5. Given the stockout in P9 and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%, the OR backend will naturally try to keep inventory lean. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the slightly higher recent demand mean and use 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is now consistently observed.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 11. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1 through 6). We currently have 7 units on-hand and 450 units in-transit. Historical demand has remained relatively stable: Mean(P1-P10) is 114.5, but recent demand (P5-P10) averages 108.5. The spike in P6 (171) seems like an outlier compared to the rest of the periods (range 85-131). Because of the 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an expected demand of ~110 per period, we need roughly 550 units in the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit). Currently, we have 457 units. Service level logic: profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, suggesting a critical ratio (q) of 0.5 (Z=0), aiming for mean coverage. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the current demand stability since P5 and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to maintain the standard safety stock and lead time assumptions.

Current date is Period 12. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Period 1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, ..., P7 in P11). In terms of demand, since Period 5 (when stock became available), the demand has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 104.5 units (P5-P11). The most recent sample in P11 was 81 units, slightly lower than average. On-hand inventory is currently 103 units, with 359 units in-transit (orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11). Since lead time is stable at 4, L+1 equals 5 periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the demand regime since stock availability began, providing a stable forecast for the next 5 periods. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the observed volatility during this same period. The OR backend will balance the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0) which implies a target service level of 50%.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105.1 units per period since the system started resolving demand in Period 5. Although the first four periods of demand (pre-stock) had a slightly lower average, the latest 8 periods (P5-P12) show a mean of ~103 units. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the service level q = 0.5, targeting the median demand. On-hand inventory is 143, with 287 in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Given the stability of the lead time and demand, I will use calculate for L and recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the full resolution history (N=8) to capture the current regime.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe consistent lead-time performance and stable demand. Lead-time inference: All orders from Period 1 to Period 9 have arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering, confirming the promised lead time of 4 is extremely reliable. Demand analysis: Demand has remained relatively stable since the start. Recent demand over the last 8 periods (Period 6 to 13) averages 105.6 units, while the lifetime average is approximately 110 units. There is no evidence of a major regime shift or seasonality at this stage. We have 88 units on-hand and 303 in-transit (orders from Periods 10-13), which aligns with roughly 4 periods of safety coverage. Using 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) focuses on the most relevant recent variability while smoothing out noise, and L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed stability of the 4-period lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current lead time is consistently 4 periods (based on P1-P10 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). Period 15 decision: We have 51 units on hand and 371 in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14). Since the promised lead time L=4 is reliable, we need enough inventory to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Looking at historical demand, there is no significant regime shift; demand fluctuates around 100 per period (mean P1-P14 is approx 101.9). P6 had a spike (171), but recent periods (P10-P14) show stability (avg ~101). I will use recent_N with N=9 (from P6 to P14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this relative stability while acknowledging the earlier variance. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently confirmed as 4 periods across 10 completed lead-time cycles (P1-P10 orders arriving in P5-P14).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16 with a consistent lead time of 4 periods established over 11 cycles (P1-P11 orders arriving). The demand for chips(Regular) has remained steady around a mean of ~100-110 units. Recent periods (P13-P15) show a slight uptick (125, 107, 123) compared to earlier periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (14), with a significant in-transit pipeline (392). Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should target the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). A 5-period window (recent_N=5) captures the current mean of 110.8 units while accounting for recent slight variance. This keeps the base stock aligned with the target of approximately 554 units total inventory (on-hand + pipeline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a stockout situation at the end of Period 16 (on-hand: 0). Recent demand analysis (Periods 13-16) shows a mean of 129.75 units, a significant increase from the initial average of ~100. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on historical arrivals. To address the increased demand and restore inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 10 samples (P7-P16) to capture the trend while maintaining stability. The sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 10 samples to account for recent volatility (approx std=25.8). With L=4, the backend will target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (1+L), which at current rates is approximately 650 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 454; this decision will bridge the gap to ensure higher service levels for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand increased from ~100 to approx 130 units starting around Period 13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4. Current inventory status is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 for the second consecutive period due to a sustained demand surge. Examining the demand history, Periods 1-12 averaged ~103 units, whereas Periods 13-17 average ~143 units (125, 107, 123, 164, 194), representing a significant regime shift. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this new elevated demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility observed in the last few periods (std ~36). L is maintained at 'default' as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods. The goal is to raise the base-stock level to prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, despite the high stocking risk implied by the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~103 to ~143 units (+38%) starting Period 13; Volatility also increased significantly in this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. A significant upward demand regime shift was detected and confirmed starting around Period 13. Demand in the last 6 periods (P13-P18) has averaged 149.1, compared to the earlier average of approximately 100. Recent demand points (125, 107, 123, 164, 194, 182) show high volatility and a sustained increase. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a large arrival of 138 units in P18, due to demand (182) exceeding supply. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (L=4). To capture the new demand level and account for increased volatility, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will adjust the base stock to cover 1+L (5) periods of high demand. Because profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, but the OR backend's cap mechanism will help prevent excessive over-ordering if the demand spike is less sustained than it appears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift firmly confirmed: Period 13-18 average is ~149 units (+49% vs initial periods), with significantly higher variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. The average demand from Period 1 through 12 was approximately 101 units, whereas the average demand from Period 13 through 19 has jumped to approximately 156 units (125, 107, 123, 164, 194, 182, 199). In the most recent 4 periods (P16-P19), demand has averaged 185 units, consistently leading to stockouts because the supply chain (constrained by the 4-period lead time) is still catching up to orders placed during the lower demand regime. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. To address the stockouts and the higher demand plateau, I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean (~156) and the increased volatility observed since Period 13. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) = 5 periods of higher demand required to replenish the pipeline and satisfy current needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift firmly confirmed: Period 13-19 average is ~156 units (+54% vs initial periods). Stockouts occurred in P16-P19 due to late reaction to this shift and 4-period lead time lag.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory for the last 5 periods (P16-P20). A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 13, where average demand increased from ~100 to over 150 units. The last 8 periods (P13-P20) show demand values: 125, 107, 123, 164, 194, 182, 199, 193. The mean of these 8 samples is approximately 160.8. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory is currently 0 and we have been losing sales, it is critical to use the most recent demand data (N=8) to reflect the new higher demand level and its increased volatility. Setting L=4 (promised and verified), mu_hat based on the last 8 samples (capturing the 160+ average), and sigma_hat also on recent samples to account for the heightened variance in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirming demand regime shift: Average demand from Period 13 to 20 is 160.8 units, a 60% increase over the initial baseline (~100 units). Volatility has also scaled with the mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 13 is undeniable and continues to escalate. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 21 is approximately 168 units, significantly higher than the initial ~100 units. Period 21 saw a peak demand of 222 units. We have experienced stockouts for six consecutive periods (P16-P21) because the inventory arriving (based on earlier, lower-demand orders) is insufficient to meet the current demand levels. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (L=4). To recover from the current zero on-hand inventory state and cover the (L+1)=5 period risk window, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (since the shift at P13). This captures the high mean (~168) and increased volatility of the current regime. Given the critical stockout situation, using the recent data ensures the base stock calculation reflects the new reality, helping the OR backend to place aggressive catch-up orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 13-21 average is 167.7 units (+68% vs initial periods). Demand peaked at 222 in P21. Stockouts from P16-P21 due to 4-period lead time lag.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 13, increasing from an average of ~100 to a recent average (P13-P22) of 168 units. In Period 22, demand was 163, following a peak of 222 in P21. We are finally seeing ending inventory (39 units) after a string of stockouts, thanks to the arrival of the larger order from Period 18 (202 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To stabilize the service level and account for the higher mean and increased volatility observed in this new regime, I am using the last 10 periods (P13-P22) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This N=10 covers the entirety of the identified shift. Setting L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is consistently realized.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P13-P22) average demand: 167.8 units, compared to P1-P12 average of 99.1 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 13, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~175 units. Period 23 saw a peak demand of 247 units, resulting in an ending inventory of 0 despite a large arrival. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P13-P23) is approximately 175.1 units, while the very recent 5-period average (P19-P23) is even higher at 204.8 units. Given the high stockout risk and the 4-period lead time, I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its increased volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P13-P23) average demand: 175.1 units, significantly higher than earlier periods. Recent 5-period average (P19-P23) is 204.8 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 13, increasing from ~100 to over 170 units. The most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) show an average demand of 198.0 units (193, 222, 163, 247, 166). Although Period 24 demand (166) was slightly lower than the recent peak, the trend remains high and volatile. Stockout conditions have been frequent. Given the 4-period lead time, we must ensure the pipeline covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full scope of the high-demand regime (P13-P24) for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides a balance between the very high recent peaks and the slightly lower start of the regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P13-P24) average is 182.3 units, compared to P1-P12 average of 99.1 units. Recent 5-period volatility remains high, with demand exceeding 200 units twice in the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a clear high-demand regime that began around Period 13. Demand in Period 25 (214 units) confirms that volatility and mean demand remain elevated relative to the early game baseline. The 5-period average (P21-P25) is approximately 195.4 units, while the 13-period average (P13-P25) is approximately 184.7 units. The 4-period lead time is consistently stable, as confirmed by the arrival of the P21 order exactly in P25. Currently, the SKU is facing stockouts due to under-ordering in previous periods before the regime shift was fully countered. With 0 on-hand inventory and 720 units in-transit, we must set parameters that reflect the current high-demand reality (recent_N=13 for the full high-demand regime) to Ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover 5 periods (L+1) of this higher volume. Setting mu_hat to recent_N=13 captures this sustained shift while sigma_hat recent_N=13 captures the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P13-P25) average is 184.7 units, compared to P1-P12 average of 99.1 units (~86% increase). Recent volatility is high, with demand exceeding 200 units in 3 of the last 5 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a clear regime shift around Period 13, increasing from an average of ~100 to over 180 units. Recent periods (P21-P26) show continued high volatility with demand values of 222, 163, 247, 166, 214, and 110. The average of the last 14 periods (P13-P26) is approximately 179 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 units on-hand and 771 units in-transit (orders from P23-P26), we must maintain high base stock levels to recover from previous stockouts and cover the L+1 demand window (approx. 5 periods * 180 = 900 units). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=14 to account for the increased variance observed in this period. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrival history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 13, increasing the mean from ~100 to nearly 180+. Recent demand (Periods 23-27) shows values of 125, 110, 214, 166, 247, indicating high volatility despite some recent lower observations. Our current pipeline (in-transit) is 697, and on-hand is 39. The promised lead time of 4 is consistently observed. To capture the current high-demand regime while accounting for the recent variance, I will use a recent_N approach for demand parameters. Specifically, N=15 covers the entire shift period (P13-P27). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher mean and the expanded standard deviation to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 16-21 and 23/25.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilization: The shift that began in Period 13 has averaged 172.9 units over the last 15 periods (P13-P27), compared to 99 in P1-P12. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting around Period 13, increasing from a baseline of ~100 to a higher average level. More recently, the demand has shown signs of stabilization but remains volatile. The average demand from Period 13 through Period 28 is approximately 166 units, while the last 5 periods (P24-P28) average 139.6 units, indicating the peak may have passed or demand is settling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in P28 conclude message). Inventory levels have recovered to 202 units on-hand with a healthy pipeline of 560 units. To balance the service level without overstocking during this potential stabilization phase, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=16 (covering the entire post-P13 regime) to capture the broader elevated average while allowing recent lower observations to moderate the forecast. Sigma_hat will also use N=16 to account for the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-260.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting around Period 13, increasing from a mean of ~100 to a peak average of ~175 units. However, recent data (Periods 26-29) shows a cooling trend with demand values of 110, 125, 83, and 71. This suggests the high-demand phase has ended or is stabilizing at a lower level than the peak observed in the Period 20s. The current on-hand inventory (331) and in-transit (416) are very high relative to these recent demand observations. To avoid excessive holding costs (which equal profit per unit), I am pivoting the forecast to reflect the most recent regime shift (the cooling period). I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this downturn while still accounting for the volatility that has characterized recent periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend detected: Average demand from P26-P29 is 97.25 units, significantly down from the P19-P25 average of ~190 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-320.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. First, a significant spike occurred starting around Period 13, peaking at over 200 units. Second, as noted in the Carry-over Insights for Period 30, a cooling trend has emerged since Period 26. In the most recent five periods (P26-P30), demand has averaged 95.4 units (110, 125, 83, 71, 88), which is very close to the initial baseline of ~100 units. The inventory position is currently high (on-hand: 408, in-transit: 251) due to late arrivals from the previous high-demand regime. With lead time stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this cooling trend and prevent further inventory bloat while slowly drawing down the existing surplus. L remains default as the 4-period lead time is consistently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand for P26-P30 (last 5 periods) is 95.4 units, returning to near the initial P1-P12 baseline after the mid-game spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-388.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly returned to its baseline level. The cooling trend noted in previous periods is confirmed, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) showing demands of 125, 83, 71, 88, and 53 (avg: 84 units). This is a significant drop from the peak period (P13-P25) and aligns closely with the initial Period 1-12 baseline (~100 units). Currently, the system has 441 units on-hand and 165 in-transit (orders from P28 and P29). Given the current demand rate, this inventory plus the incoming pipeline (Total 606 units) is sufficient to cover approximately six periods of demand. To prevent excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase, I will continue to set the order quantity to zero by setting parameters based on the most recent 5-period regime. L remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Average demand for P27-P31 is 84 units, reinforcing the return to the initial baseline level after the P13-P25 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-346.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly transitioned from a peak regime (P13-P25, avg ~185) back to a lower baseline regime. For the last 7 periods (P26-P32), the average demand is 90.3 units, which is very similar to the initial P1-P12 average of ~99. Currently, the system has 448 units on-hand and 56 units in-transit (due to arrive in P33 resolution). With demand now stabilized around 90-100 units/period, the current pipeline (504 units) is sufficient to cover more than 5 periods of demand (L+1 = 5). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower baseline while acknowledging the recent volatility. Setting L to 'default' (4) as lead times have been perfectly consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has stabilized back to original baseline: P26-P32 average demand is 90.3 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a significant spike between Periods 13 and 25. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P26-P33) is 90.0 units, which is consistent with the initial baseline of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, there is a large inventory surplus (416 units on-hand), which is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Specifically, 5 periods of demand at the current average would be roughly 450 units, but because the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), and the backend calculation for the base stock level at this lower demand regime will likely be close to the current on-hand inventory, the priority is to avoid further accumulation of holding costs. I will use the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect the stabilized lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend stops ordering until the inventory is depleted to an efficient level.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has definitively returned to the initial baseline level following the spike seen between Periods 13 and 25. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P26-P34) is approximately 90.7 units, which aligns with the P1-P12 average of 99.1 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 320 units, which is quite high relative to the current demand levels (expected demand for L+1 periods is roughly 450-500 units). There are 34 units in-transit (ordered in P34) arriving in P38. However, our on-hand inventory already covers approximately 3.5 periods of demand. The OR backend will likely recommend ordering 0 until the pipeline inventory falls closer to the base stock level. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'low demand' regime since Period 26. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-50.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean following the significant spike seen between Periods 13 and 25. Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), the average demand is 95.1 units, which aligns with the initial baseline identified in the early game. Recent demand shows some variability (e.g., 135 in P35, 53 in P31), so I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture this stabilized regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on historical arrival data. The current on-hand inventory (185) plus in-transit stock (134) is 319 units. Given the lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At a mean of ~95, 5 periods of demand is ~475 units. The system is currently under-stocked relative to this new baseline, requiring orders to replenish the pipeline. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current mean and recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~95 units/period starting Period 26, matching the initial pre-spike baseline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the spike between periods 13 and 25. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand is 94.5 units, which aligns closely with the initial baseline of ~100. Recent periods (P34-P36) show slightly higher variation (96, 135, 112), bringing the 5-period average to 106.6 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (N=11) to capture this stable post-spike regime while smoothing out the recent minor fluctuations. Sigma_hat is also set based on these 11 samples to accurately reflect current volatility. The 'In-transit' quantity of 270 units covers roughly 2.5-3 periods of future demand at current rates, necessitating consistent replenishment to avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the game when transitioning between regimes.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized back to a baseline level of approximately 95-100 units per period following a significant spike between Periods 13-25. The last few periods (P34-P37) show demand values of 96, 135, 112, and 100. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while a substantial pipeline (406 units) is in transit. However, there has been a gap in arrivals from P34-P37 (zero units arrived), which is expected as no orders were placed in P30-P33. Arrivals should resume in P38 (from the P34 order). To maintain the pipeline against the stable baseline demand and the 4-period lead time, I will set L to 4 (promised and verified) and use the most recent 12 periods (P26-P37) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire period since the demand cooled, providing a stable estimate of the current regime. Setting N=12 captures the return to baseline while ignoring the previous high-demand spike.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its original baseline of approximately 95-105 units per period following a significant spike between Periods 13 and 25. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 451 units in transit. Note that orders from P30-P33 were 0, which created the current gap in arrivals. The order from P34 (34 units) arrived in P38, confirming the lead time remains 4 periods. However, the order from P35 (100 units) should arrive in P39, and P36 (136 units) in P40. We are currently facing stockouts due to the gap in ordering during the inventory flush-out phase. I will set the demand parameters using recent_N (N=13) to capture the stabilized post-spike behavior (starting P26) and the lead time remains at the default promised/validated 4 periods. This helps the OR backend project the correct base stock to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the significant pipeline already in place.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its original baseline level (approx 100 units/period) following a significant spike between Periods 13 and 25. The recent average demand (P35-P39) is 108.8 units, though there was a stockout in P37 and P38 due to a lack of arrivals. Regarding lead time, orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33 (which were for 0 units) resulted in no 'conclude' arrival messages, making the timeline appear broken. However, the order from P34 arrived in P38 (L=4) and the order from P35 arrived in P39 (L=4), confirming the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 33, and there is a large in-transit pipeline of 398 units (ordered P36-P39), which are expected to arrive in Periods 40-43. To avoid over-ordering given the massive pipeline relative to the stabilized demand, I will use a recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stability (covering P26-P39) while maintaining the default lead time (4) and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to its original baseline range (~90-100 units/period) following a significant spike between Periods 13 and 25. Over the last 15 periods (since P26), the mean demand is 93.3 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods, P36-P40) average is 99.8 units with a moderate standard deviation. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P36 order in P40. Currently, on-hand inventory is 79 units, with 317 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). I will use a recent_N of 15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime while providing enough sample size to buffer against the volatility observed in the return-to-baseline phase. This approach ensures the base stock (covering 1+4=5 periods of demand) targets approximately 500 units, which is appropriate given the current pipeline and on-hand levels.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 95 units per period since Period 26, effectively returning to the pre-spike baseline. Reviewing recent history (P36-P41), demand values were 112, 100, 130, 67, 90, and 87, with an average of 97.6 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P34-P37. Current on-hand inventory is 128 units, and pipeline inventory is 269 units (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). To maintain the desired service level (balanced profit and holding cost) for the current 95-unit demand regime with a 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (since Period 27) to capture the stabilized baseline statistics while excluding the high-demand spike. L remains at the default/promised 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at the initial baseline of ~95-100 units per period following a significant spike from Period 13-25. Analysis of the last 17 periods (P26-P42) shows an average demand of approximately 94.7 units, with the most recent 10-period average being around 106 units due to a slight uptick in P42 (154 units). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P34-P38 arrivals). Pipeline inventory is currently 269 units (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42), which covers nearly 3 periods of average demand. With 53 units on-hand, total supply (322) is roughly in line with a (L+1)=5 period demand window (approx 500 units needed). Using recent_N with N=17 (covering the post-spike stability) for mu_hat captures the current mean of ~95-100. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N naturally to reflect the observed volatility in this stable regime. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is accurate.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around the initial baseline (~100 units/period) after the significant spike that occurred between Periods 13 and 25. Recent demand (P39-P43) has averaged approximately 104.8 units, though Period 42 saw a higher-than-average value of 154. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. As of Period 44, we are at on-hand inventory of 0 but have 365 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 and current period 44, orders placed now (P44) will arrive in P48. With the game ending at P50, we must ensure we cover demand for the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50) while managing the risk of excess inventory at the end. I will use recent_N (N=18, starting from P26 when the cooling trend began) to estimate mean and volatility, which captures the current stable regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 of 50. The demand regime has stabilized back to its original baseline of approximately 95-100 units per period after a significant spike mid-game. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to recent high demand (P42: 154, P43: 116) and slightly delayed ordering responses. There are 447 units in-transit, which is sufficient to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (approx 500 units total demand expected at current rates). Specifically, arrivals from orders P41, P42, P43, and P44 are expected in periods 45, 46, 47, and 48 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 (covering periods since the cooling trend stabilized around P26) to reflect the current 100-unit mean. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the moderate volatility observed in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent concluded arrivals (P38, P39, P40).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 46/50). The demand regime has stabilized following the significant spike between Periods 13-25, and now reflects the initial baseline level. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is 97.4 units, consistent with the long-term baseline (approx. 95-100 units). The inventory position is currently 0 on-hand with 410 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, orders placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50, which is the final period. Orders placed in Period 47 or later will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, the goal for this period is to ensure that the pipeline inventory plus the current order covers the remaining demand for Periods 46 through 50. With 5 periods remaining and an average demand of ~97 units/period, the total requirement is approximately 485 units. Since there are already 410 units in-transit, the OR backend needs to target a base stock levels that accounts for this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the stable post-spike demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the stable lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since Period 26, following a significant spike between Periods 13 and 25. Recent demand (P42-P46) has shown fluctuations (71, 129, 84, 116, 154) but averages 110.8 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory state: 8 units on-hand and 456 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent orders from P43 (143), P44 (137), P45 (51), and P46 (125). Given the 4-period lead time, the P43 order (143 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P47) resolution phase, and subsequent orders will arrive in P48, P49, and P50. Since the game ends at Period 50, the total supply currently in the pipeline (456 units) plus on-hand (8 units) equals 464 units. Over the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50), at a mean demand of ~100-110 units, the total expected demand is approximately 400-440 units. Therefore, the pipeline is already sufficient to cover the rest of the game with a buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the stable post-spike regime while smoothing recent volatility, and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the overall variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a baseline average of approximately 95-100 units following the large spike between Periods 13 and 25. Recent demand observations (P43-P47: 116, 84, 129, 71, 74) average to 94.8 units, confirming this stability. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). While there have been minor stockouts due to high pipeline inventory and the 4-period lag, the current on-hand inventory (77) plus the significant in-transit inventory (345) is more than sufficient to cover the next 4 periods of demand (estimated at ~100/period). I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-spike baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculate method for L as the lead time is highly stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 95-100 units per period following a significant spike between Periods 13-25. In the most recent 10 periods (P39-P48), mean demand is 98.7 units with a standard deviation of 27.6. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P48 of the P44 order. Current inventory position: On-hand (108) + In-transit (269) = 377 units. Given the game ends at Period 50, and current inventory plus incoming orders for P49 and P50 (ordered in P45-P46) already cover approximately 3.8 periods of average demand, I will maintain a consistent base-stock calculation using recent demand (N=10) to avoid over-ordering in the final stages of the game, while ensuring sufficient stock for the remaining 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 26, following a significant spike between Periods 13-25. Analysis of the most recent 24 periods (P26-P49) shows a mean demand of approximately 96 units per period, which aligns with the initial pre-spike baseline documented in the CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals (P42-P45 arriving on schedule). Currently, on-hand inventory is 38 units with 330 units in-transit (orders from P46-P49). Using N=24 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this stable 'new-normal' regime while excluding the high-volatility spike. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the service level against the $1.0 holding cost per unit.
