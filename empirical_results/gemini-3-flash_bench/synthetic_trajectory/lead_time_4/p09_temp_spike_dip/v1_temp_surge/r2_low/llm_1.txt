Total expected demand for 5 periods is 114 * 5 = 570 units. I will add a small safety stock (approx. 1 standard deviation per period) to ensure I don't stock out given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (note: here both are $1.0, so the service level should be roughly 50% according to the newsboy model, but early stock-outs are more detrimental to total reward).

Period 46 (Period_46) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a baseline average of approximately 100 units/period (average demand P40-P45 is 101.6). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 40, 42, 43, 44, and 45. We are currently in Period 46, and the game ends at Period 50. Since the lead time is 4 periods, an order placed now in Period 46 will arrive at the start of Period 51 (the arrival resolution after Period 50's decision phase), which is too late to satisfy any demand within the game's duration. Furthermore, the existing pipeline (In-transit: 350 units) plus current on-hand inventory (100 units) totals 450 units. With 5 periods of demand remaining (P46-P50) and an average demand of ~100 units, 450 units is slightly below the expected 500 units needed, but any new order placed now will not arrive in time to resolve this. Therefore, the optimal action is to place no further orders to avoid unnecessary holding costs for inventory that arrives after the game ends.",

Period 47 (Period_47) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline of ~100 units/period after a high-demand surge (P16-P25) and subsequent cooling. Recent demand (P40-P46) averages 102 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47, P48, P49, P50), our goal is to maximize profit while minimizing ending inventory and avoiding stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 29. In-transit inventory consists of: P43 order (50 units, ETA P47), P44 order (150 units, ETA P48), and P45 order (150 units, ETA P49). Total pipeline is 350 units. Expected demand for the remaining 4 periods is approximately 400 units (4 * 100). Total units available/arriving will be On-hand (29) + P43 arrival (50) + P44 arrival (150) + P45 arrival (150) = 379 units. To cover the expected demand of 400 and ensure a small safety buffer against volatility (last week saw demand of 154 at P42), I will order 50 units. This order will arrive at the start of Period 51 arrival resolution (effectively for P51 or the final tally), but more importantly, ensures we are covered if demand spikes in the final periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), over-ordering is risky, so a conservative 50 units is appropriate to cover the 21-unit deficit from current pipeline vs. expected demand.",

Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:

{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 48 with 5 periods remaining in the simulation (total 52). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Orders placed today (P48) will arrive in Period 52's arrival resolution phase, making them available for Period 52's demand. Average baseline demand has stabilized around 100 units/period (recent periods 40-47 average ~100 units). Current inventory state: On-hand = 5, In-transit = 350 (from P44-P47). Breaking down the pipeline: P44(150) arrives P48, P45(150) arrives P49, P46(0) arrives P50, P47(50) arrives P51. To satisfy demand for the remaining periods (P48-P52), we need approximately 500 units. Total projected supply available through P51 is 5 (on-hand) + 150 (P44) + 150 (P45) + 0 (P46) + 50 (P47) = 355 units. We are facing a projected shortfall of ~145 units for Period 52 demand. Ordering 150 units today ensures we have stock for the final period of visibility while minimizing holding costs for previous periods.",

Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning any order placed in Period 49 would arrive in Period 53 (after the game ends). Therefore, the action for Period 49 should be 0. Current on-hand inventory is 49. In-transit arrivals for Period 49 (ordered P45) and Period 50 (ordered P46) will satisfy remaining demand. Specifically: Period 49 start on-hand (49) + expected Period 49 arrival (150 from P45) = 199 units available to cover Period 49 demand. Period 50 will start with whatever remains plus the expected arrival from P46 (which was 0 units ordered). Demand has stabilized around 100 units/period (avg P26-P48 is ~95). Since the game concludes in two steps and the lead time exceeds the remaining duration, no new orders can be fulfilled.",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 50, the final period of the game. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, the goal is to maximize Period 50's ending profit. Since the game ends after this period, any order placed now will not arrive within the game's timeline (Lead Time = 4 periods) and will therefore not contribute to demand satisfaction, nor will it incur holding costs. Additionally, the current on-hand inventory is 78 units, while the recent average demand (P40-P49) is approximately 104 units. Any inventory on hand at the end of Period 50 incurs a holding cost of $1.0 per unit, while lost sales represent a lost profit opportunity of $1.0 per unit. Since the on-hand inventory is already likely insufficient to meet Period 50's demand (which has a mean of ~100), there is no risk of excessive holding costs from the existing stock. Placing an order for 0 units is the optimal terminal strategy as it avoids unnecessary pipeline accumulation that provides no reward.",
