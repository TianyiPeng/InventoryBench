Therefore, any order placed in Periods 47, 48, 49, or 50 will incur costs but will never arrive in time to satisfy demand or generate revenue. My strategy now is to maximize the utility of the existing inventory and the arrivals already in the pipeline (ordered in Periods 43, 44, 45, and 46). On-hand inventory is 105. In-transit units are 344 (specifically: P43=120, P44=104, P45=60, P46=60). These will arrive in Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 respectively. Total available units for the remaining 4 periods (47-50) is 105 (on-hand) + 344 (in-transit) = 449 units. Average demand is approx 100-115 per period. Total expected demand for 4 periods is roughly 400-460 units. The pipeline is sufficient to cover most or all remaining demand without further ordering. Placing an order now is economically suboptimal.",

Total demand for the remaining 3 periods is expected to be approximately 300 units (based on the confirmed average of ~100 units/period). Our current on-hand inventory is 103 units. The pipeline consists of orders placed in Periods 44 (104 units), 45 (60 units), and 46 (60 units), totaling 224 units in-transit. These are scheduled to arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50 respectively. Total supply (On-hand 103 + In-transit 224) is 327 units, which is sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~300 units until the end of the game. Since any order placed now (Period 48) with a 4-period lead time would not arrive until Period 52 (after the game ends), and our current inventory/pipeline is sufficient, no further orders are necessary.",

Any order placed now (Period 49) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 53, which is well past the game's conclusion. Therefore, any capital spent on ordering now will result in zero revenue and potentially drag down the total reward. Looking at the current state: We have 127 units on-hand. There are 120 units in-transit (60 units from P45 arriving in P49 resolution, and 60 units from P46 arriving in P50 resolution). Even if P45's shipment was lost, history shows demand averages around 100-115 units per period. With 127 units currently on-hand, we already have enough inventory to cover the expected demand for the remaining two periods (P49 and P50) even with zero further arrivals. Adding more orders would be a waste of resources. Thus, the order quantity is set to 0.",

According to the execution sequence, any order placed in the decision phase of Period 50 will not arrive until Period 54 (given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods). Since the game concludes at the end of Period 50, any units ordered now will neither satisfy demand nor generate profit, but would simply represent unnecessary expenditure if captured in a final accounting. The current on-hand inventory is 68 units, and there are 60 units in-transit (ordered in Period 46) scheduled to arrive during Period 50's arrival resolution phase. Total available inventory to meet Period 50's demand is 128 units (68 on-hand + 60 arriving). Recent demand averages roughly 100-110 units.
