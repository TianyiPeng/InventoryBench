Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context regarding lead times or specific dates yet, other than the initial demand samples provided. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The demand samples (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) show a mean of 99.8 and a standard deviation of 31.8. Given the limited history (5 samples), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the mean and variance of these samples. Since promised lead time is 4, calculations based on (1+L) will cover 5 periods of demand. This will help the OR backend establish an initial base stock to satisfy the high service level requirement (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time (L) of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory and 154 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 89, which resulted in lost sales since on-hand was 0. The historical demand samples (Period 1-5: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121) suggest a mean demand of approximately 100 units per period. Since L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5. Total demand over 5 periods is roughly 500 units. Our current pipeline (154) is significantly below the required base stock to cover 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (L=4) and 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the provided historical average. This will signal the OR backend to increase the order to fill the gap between the pipeline and the target base stock (approx (1+4)*100 = 500).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, it is expected that no units have arrived yet (orders from Period 1 should arrive in Period 5). Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0 and all demand so far has been lost. Total in-transit is 299 units (154 from P1 + 145 from P2). The historical demand samples provided are [118, 130, 72, 58, 121]. Looking at the actual demand recorded during the game (P1: 89, P2: 41), the demand appears lower than the initial samples, but the sample size is too small to declare a regime shift. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to incorporate the most relevant historical data provided in the prompt, ensuring the base stock level (for L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficient to cover upcoming demand once stock arrives.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Periods 1-3, we have seen 0 arrivals, which is consistent with a lead time of 4 (the first order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 6 start message). Demand for the first five periods (including the provided sample context) was 118, 130, 72, 58, 121, but actual demand reported in concluding messages for P1-P3 was 89, 41, 91. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 426 units in transit. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The average demand across all samples (118, 130, 72, 58, 121, 89, 41, 91) is approximately 90. mu_hat should target 5 * 90 = 450. Since we already have 426 in transit and 0 on hand, the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will trigger a small order to bridge the gap. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent volatility while waiting for the lead time to be confirmed by arrivals.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed at the start of Period 1 with a lead time of 4 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 515 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4: 154+145+127+89=515). No stock has arrived yet, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time. Demand for the first 5 samples (including the current period's observation provided in history) is 118, 130, 72, 58, 121, averaging 99.8. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I'll use all 5 available samples to establish a stable mean, setting N=5. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=5 to capture the variance observed in the initial periods. The OR engine will target a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balanced by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The history shows the first order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. We currently have 57 units on-hand and 390 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121; though the game history 'conclude' messages show slightly different values: 89, 41, 91, 95, 97) averages approximately 82.6 units per period. Using the game history data (excluding the prompt's sample list which seems to represent a prior or different distribution), the mean is (89+41+91+95+97)/5 = 82.6. Standard deviation is approx 24. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4, the review + lead period is L+1 = 5. mu_hat should target approximately 5 * 82.6 = 413 units. sigma_hat should be approximately sqrt(5) * 24 = 53.6. I will use the 'default' method for L (since it matches the promised 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full actual game history demand profile.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Both arrived exactly on schedule (lead_time = 4). Demand over the first 6 periods has been as follows: 89, 41, 91, 95, 97, 96. There appears to be a stabilization/increase in demand starting around Period 3. The mean of the last 4 periods (P3-P6) is 94.75, which is significantly higher than the initial average. Total inventory position (on-hand 106 + in-transit 298) is 404 units. With L=4, the backend looks at (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) captures the current higher-demand regime (avg ~95) while sigma_hat recent_N=4 captures the reduced volatility seen lately compared to the very low P2 value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 95 units/period starting Period 3; Lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2007.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3). The demand since Period 3 has transitioned to a new regime with a mean of approximately 98.2 units (samples: 91, 95, 97, 96, 112), which is higher than the initial samples. Currently, On-hand is 121 and In-transit is 251 (orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7), totaling 372 units of pipeline inventory. This covers the next 4 periods of expected demand (approx 400). I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the stabilized demand regime and set L to default (which is the promised 4 periods) as the observed lead time matches the promised one.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~98 units/period since Period 3 (Periods 3-7 avg: 98.2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1590.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 9. On-hand 120, In-transit 274 (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). Promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical analysis of arrived orders (P1-P4) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Regarding demand: Samples from P1 and P2 were outliers (89, 41), but from P3-P8 demand has stabilized in a narrow range around 95-100 units. Specifically, the mean of the last 6 periods (P3-P8) is 96.83 with a standard deviation of 7.9. Since L=4, my target window (L+1) is 5 periods. I am using recent_N=6 to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=6 ensures we exclude the noisy P1/P2 data while maintaining enough samples for a reliable average and volatility estimate. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (~485 units), then subtract the pipeline inventory (274) and current on-hand (120) to determine the next order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2671.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals (confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-9). The demand in Period 9 spiked to 141, which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~98. This could indicate a potential regime shift or seasonal spike, though it's only one data point. The current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units). However, the in-transit pipeline is 355 units (orders from Periods 6-9: 53+80+112+110=355), with 53 units expected to arrive during Period 10. To account for the recent demand increase while balancing the risk of over-ordering, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher Period 9 value, setting N=5 (Periods 5-9 avg: 107.2). For lead time, I will stick with the confirmed lead time of 4. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility introduced by Period 9's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 9 (141 vs previous avg ~98); monitoring for sustained shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1159.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand was 100 but we only had 61 units on-hand, leading to a stockout. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P10). Demand from P3-P10 has averaged 104.6 units per period, but we see two distinct levels: P3-P8 averaged ~98, while P9-P10 averaged 120.5 (141 and 100). This suggests a potential variance increase or a slight upward shift in the demand regime. Since we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with a 4-period lead time, we must maintain a robust base stock to recover service levels. I will set L=4 (promised and actual), and use the last 8 periods (P3-P10) for mu_hat to capture the most relevant demand regime while acknowledging the recent spike. Sigma_hat will also use the last 8 periods to reflect the increased volatility (~120.5 vs ~98).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/volatility increase starting Period 9: Period 9-10 average is 120.5 units compared to previous P3-P8 average of 98.2 units.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in behavior. While Periods 3-8 averaged approximately 98 units, Periods 9-11 show increased volatility and demand (141, 100, 89), with Period 11 resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). Currently, there are 495 units in-transit, which includes orders from Period 8 (112 units arriving this period), Period 9 (110 units), Period 10 (142 units), and Period 11 (131 units). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high service level target (q = 19/20 = 95%) and recent stockouts, I will set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (average ~110) to account for the current demand regime and ensure enough safety stock to handle the observed variance using recent history for sigma_hat.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand was 153 units, confirming a significant upward shift or volatility increase starting from Period 9. The average demand since Period 9 (P9-P12) is 120.75 units, compared to the previous stable period (P3-P8) of 98.2 units. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have faced stockouts for three consecutive periods (P10-P12). The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P12). For my decision in Period 13, I need enough inventory to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent demand average (last 4 periods of 120.75), mu_hat should target ~604 total units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand shift confirmed: Period 9-12 average demand is 120.75 units, a 23% increase over the P3-P8 average of 98.2 units. Frequent stockouts due to underestimation of this shift.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a sustained upward shift. The average demand from Period 9 to 13 is approximately 122.6 units (141, 100, 89, 153, 130), compared to the earlier regime of ~98 units. This has resulted in four consecutive periods of stockouts (ending on-hand inventory = 0) because the pipeline was calibrated to a lower mean. To recover and maintain a higher service level, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the shift from Period 9 onwards) for mu_hat. This targets the new mean demand across the (L+1) horizon. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 will capture the increased volatility of the higher demand regime, which is necessary to calculate an appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P9-P13) confirmed at avg 122.6 units (25% increase), sustaining the prior insight of a shift around Period 9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1798.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 9. Analysis of demand from Period 9 to 14 shows an average of ~118 units (141, 100, 89, 153, 130, 97), which is significantly higher than the previous P3-P8 average of ~98. Specifically, the last 6 periods (P9-P14) have had high volatility and several stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed deliveries (P10 order arrived P14, lead_time 4). On-hand inventory is low (45), and although in-transit is high (572), previous periods have shown that the OR backend was under-ordering relative to the new demand mean. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this higher demand regime clearly. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for the increased variance since Period 9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 9-14 confirmed at average ~118 units, compared to P3-P8 average of ~98 units. High volatility remains present.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1504.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift around Period 9. While the long-term average (P1-P8) was approximately 94 units, the recent demand (P9-P15) averages approximately 113.5 units, albeit with significant volatility (highs of 153, lows of 84). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on the most recent arrivals (P14 and P15 arrivals both confirmed 4 periods). Since the shift at Period 9, we have 7 periods of data in this 'new' regime. Using N=7 for mu_hat captures this higher average (approx 113.5) to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 10-13. For sigma_hat, N=7 accounts for the increased volatility observed during this same period. The inventory position (92 on-hand + 514 in-transit) is healthy, but we must maintain parameters that reflect the higher demand mean to satisfy the OR backend's base-stock calculation for the (L+1) protection interval.

Daily Reward (R_t): $612.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility and a clear regime shift after Period 8. Analyzing the recent history: Demand Periods 9-16 recorded values of 141, 100, 89, 153, 130, 97, 84, and 43. The average for this most recent regime (P9-P16) is approximately 104.6 units per period, although the last two periods have seen a sharp decline (84 and 43), possibly indicating another shift or mean reversion. Total inventory position (on-hand 205 + in-transit 421 = 626) is substantial relative to recent demand. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all 12 completed arrivals. Given the recent drop in demand but the high historical variance, I will use a recent_N window (N=8) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the late-game regime while allowing the recent lower samples to pull the forecast down slightly. This prevents over-ordering while maintaining safety stock for potential spikes. Lead time (L) is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; average demand for Periods 9-16 is 104.6 units, reflecting a lower mean than the P9-P14 window (118) due to lower demand in P15-P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward shift and high volatility. After a high-demand period (P9-P14 avg ~118), demand has dropped sharply in the last three periods (P15-P17) to 84, 43, and 39 respectively. The current on-hand inventory (338) and in-transit units (277) are very high relative to this recent drop. The promised lead time of 4 holds (actual lead times remain consistently 4). To avoid excessive holding costs from over-stocking during this apparent downturn, I am reducing mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, I am using a larger window (recent_N=9) to capture the overall decline from the P9 peak while still incorporating the impact of the recent low-demand periods. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=6 to specifically focus on the high volatility observed in the most recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward starting Period 15: P15-P17 average demand is 55.3 units, a significant decrease from the P9-P14 average of ~118 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1109.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation confirms a significant demand regime shift downwards that began around Period 15. The demand for the last 4 periods (P15-P18) has been 84, 43, 39, and 78, averaging 61 units. This is a sharp decrease from the previous regime (P9-P14) which averaged ~118. On-hand inventory is currently very high (373 units) due to large orders placed during the previous high-demand regime arriving now. The pipeline (in-transit) already contains 204 units. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for this lower demand, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current lower-demand regime (P15-P18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift downward confirmed: Period 15-18 average demand is 61 units, a ~48% decrease from the P9-P14 average of 118 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a high-demand period (P9-P14, avg ~118), demand dropped significantly starting P15. The average demand for the last five periods (P15-P19) is 57.4 units (84, 43, 39, 78, 43). Current on-hand inventory is 403 units, with 131 units still in-transit. Given the lower demand and high inventory, we are currently overstocked (On-hand alone covers ~7 periods of current demand). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock level downward to avoid further excess inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $554.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downward starting around Period 15. The average demand for the most recent period (P15-P20) is approximately 56.3 units per period. Comparing this to the previous regime (P9-P14, avg ~118) and the earliest regime (P3-P8, avg ~98), we are currently in a low-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 415 units, with 68 units in-transit (total pipeline = 483). Based on the current demand rate of ~56 units/period, we have over 8 periods of supply already available, which significantly exceeds the target coverage for L+1 (5 periods). My priority is to allow the existing inventory to be consumed to minimize holding costs, especially since the profit-to-holding cost ratio is 19:1, but the inventory level is already very high relative to the recent demand mean and variance. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this lower volume, and use current lead time (L=4) to ensure the backend recognizes the total coverage needs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Period 15-20 is established at an average of 56.3 units, confirming a 52% decrease from the P9-P14 peak regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downward starting Period 15, with the average demand for the last 7 periods (P15-P21) being approximately 56.4 units. This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~118). Current on-hand inventory is 386 units, and there are 40 units in-transit (ordered in Period 18). Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we are planning for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current demand rate, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 282 units. Since on-hand inventory (386) already exceeds this requirement and the pipeline inventory is also present, we do not need to order additional stock. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend recognizes the reduced need for inventory, thereby minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P15-P21 established at avg 56.4 units, representing a sustained 52% decrease from the P9-P14 regime. Inventory levels are currently high relative to this new demand.

Current on-hand inventory is 384 units, which is exceptionally high\u2014covering nearly 7 periods of demand at the current rate (384 / 54.6 \u2248 7). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, my total target inventory (L+1 coverage) only needs to be around 273 units (5 periods * 54.6). Because the current on-hand inventory (384) already exceeds this target even without any additional in-transit units, the OR backend will correctly calculate a zero order to draw down the excess. I will set the parameters to reflect this recent low-demand regime (N=8) to prevent over-ordering in the near future while holding cost is managed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P15-P22 confirmed at avg 54.6 units, maintaining the ~50% decrease from the P9-P14 regime. Inventory levels are high, requiring zero ordering until on-hand stocks normalize.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 15-23) shows a significant downward shift, with average demand now at 57.4 units per period (P15-P23 avg: 84, 43, 39, 78, 43, 51, 57, 42, 80). The current on-hand inventory of 304 units is very high relative to this demand level, which would cover more than 5 periods of forecasted demand without any additional orders. In-transit inventory is 0. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (Total Inventory = On-hand + In-transit), keeping L at 4 and using recent_N for mu_hat with N=9 (the length of the current low-demand regime) will result in a base-stock level significantly lower than our current on-hand inventory, effectively triggering an order of zero to allow inventory to deplete and minimize holding costs. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P15-P23 established at avg 57.4 units, showing a sustained ~50% decrease compared to the P9-P14 peak regime (~118 units).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level (mean ~57 units) since Period 15, compared to earlier periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 270 units, which is approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the current average. Pipeline inventory includes 51 units ordered in Period 24, which will arrive around Period 28/29. The OR objective is to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 periods (5 periods). Given current on-hand (270) + in-transit (51) = 321 units, and expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 285 units (5 * 57), we are slightly above the required inventory. However, the backend capped policy and base stock logic will naturally reduce the order to 0 if base_stock < pipeline_inventory. I will set the parameters based on the most recent 10-period regime (P15-P24) to lock in the lower demand forecast (mu_hat) and appropriate volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 15. For the interval P15 to P25 (the last 11 samples), the average demand is approximately 56.3 units, compared to the peak regime of ~118 units. Currently, on-hand inventory (202 units) and in-transit units (75 units) sum to 277 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (T=1), we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. At an average of 56.3 units/period, the expected demand over the lead time is approximately 281.5 units. Our total pipeline (277) is nearly aligned with this requirement. To account for the recent demand stabilization and prevent further excessive stock holding (carrying cost is $1.0 vs $19.0 profit), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this lower demand regime accurately. The OR backend will likely order a small amount to top off the pipeline to the base stock level calculated from these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P15-P25 established at avg 56.3 units, confirming the ~52% decrease from the P9-P14 regime persists for over 10 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been settled at a lower average of approx 56-58 units since Period 15, although Period 26 showed a spike to 106. The Period 9-14 peak (avg ~118) is clearly over. The current on-hand inventory (96) plus in-transit stock (147) totals 243 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. At the established recent average of ~57 units per period, 5 periods of demand equals ~285 units. With 243 units already in the system, we are slightly under-stocked relative to a service-level-optimized base stock, especially considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1). I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the period since the downward shift at P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which accurately reflects the current lower but volatile demand environment. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context has shifted again. After a period of low demand (approx. 56 units) from P15 to P25, the last two periods (P26: 106, P27: 125) indicate a sudden return to higher demand levels, reminiscent of the regime seen around Period 9. My on-hand inventory is now 0, and a stockout occurred in Period 27 (demand 125, sold 96). With a lead time of 4 periods, I must react immediately to this spike, while acknowledging that the in-transit inventory of 242 units is substantial. However, given the current stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly toward this new demand spike (averaging approx. 100 units/period) while relying on the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 26: Demand increased from a 10-period average of ~56 units to an average of 115.5 units (P26-P27), signaling a return to high-demand patterns.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has shifted upward again starting at Period 26, moving from a multi-period average of ~56 units to an average of 112.7 units over the last three periods (P26: 106, P27: 125, P28: 107). This confirms the shift noted in the previous carry-over insight. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are experiencing stockouts (only 51 units sold against 107 demand in Period 28). Significant in-transit inventory (339 units) is expected to arrive over the next few periods (orders from P25, P26, P27, P28). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this new high-demand regime (112.7 * 5 = 563.5) and adjust sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to account for recent volatility. This should prompt the OR engine to order enough to cover the lead time + review period while considering the incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 26 confirmed: P26-P28 average demand is 112.7 units, a 100% increase from the previous 10-period low-demand regime (~56 units).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a high-demand regime starting at Period 26. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P26-P29) is 113.5 units, significantly higher than the ~56 units seen in the prior ten periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced consecutive stockouts. Although 446 units are in-transit, only a small portion is arriving immediately (P26's order of 72 units is expected in P30). Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we must set our base stock using the last 4 periods of the new regime to ensure we return to a healthy service level and recover from the stockouts while navigating the pipeline lag. I'm using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1368.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 26. The average demand over the last five periods (P26-P30) is approximately 114.2 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is experiencing stockouts because current arrivals (from low-order periods) are insufficient to meet the new demand level. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals (P26 order arrived in P30). To optimize the base stock for the OR backend, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-demand window (P26-P30). With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the backend will target a high service level. The pipeline inventory (503 units) reflects the aggressive ordering initiated since the demand shift was detected. Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this high demand while the backend handles the pipeline reconciliation.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P26-P30) confirmed: average demand 114.2 units/period, representing a significant return to peak demand levels seen in P9-P14.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand phase starting at Period 26. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P26-P31) is approximately 119.8 units (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148). This is a significant return to the peak levels seen earlier in the game (P9-P14). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the high volatility (std dev for P26-P31 is ~15), I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods of the high-demand regime to ensure sufficient stock for the upcoming lead time and review period. Setting L to 4 matches the consistent delivery performance. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent 6-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P26-P31) confirmed at average ~120 units/period, matching the previous high-regime seen in P9-P14.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a high-demand phase starting at Period 26. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P26-P32), the average demand is approximately 116.8 units (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98), with a standard deviation of roughly 17 units. This matches the 'high regime' noted in historical carry-over insights (P9-P14). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 26, the demand mean is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (avg ~56). I will use a recent_N method with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand behavior while providing enough buffer for the observed volatility. In-transit inventory is high (503 units), and on-hand is 50. The OR backend will balance this against the (L+1) horizon (575-600 units expected demand) to determine the next order.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P26-P32) confirmed: average demand ~117 units/period, consistent with the earlier P9-P14 peak regime.

Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the most recent arrivals (Orders from P28 and P29 arriving exactly at P32 and P33). Currently, we have 67 units on hand and 463 units in transit. The target pipeline inventory (base stock) needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Given the high demand average (~117) and recent variability (demand reached 148 in P31), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation accurately. This aligns the OR backend with the most recent 8 periods of high demand to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P26-P33) confirmed: average demand ~117 units/period, consistent with P9-P14 peak levels.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reside in a high-demand regime that began in Period 26. Analyzing the most recent stable window (Periods 26-34), the average demand is approximately 117.2 units per period (106, 125, 107, 116, 117, 148, 98, 114, 122). This matches the peak levels seen earlier in Periods 9-14. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history when shipments arrive. Currently, on-hand inventory is 74 units, with 442 units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture this specific high-demand regime (starting P26) which accurately reflects the current market state. Sigma_hat will also use N=9 to account for the volatility inherent in this peak period. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock levels sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) at current high demand levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting at Period 26, following a period of low demand. Analyzing the current regime (Periods 26-35), the average demand is 114.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., Period 31 order arrived in Period 35). Currently, we have 83 units on-hand and 467 units in-transit (orders from Periods 32, 33, 34, and 35). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the system targets a high service level (95th percentile). I will use the recent 10 periods (N=10) of the high-demand regime to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is sufficient to cover demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). The OR backend's capped policy will manage the risk of over-ordering while maintaining availability.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P26-P35) stable: average demand 114.1 units/period, \u03c3 \u2248 17.5. Previous low-demand phase (P15-P25) ended at P26.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 26. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the average demand is approximately 114.3 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Although the demand in Period 36 was lower (67 units), the overall trend remains consistent with the high-demand state identified in the carry-over insights. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 28-32 and 34-36. Current on-hand inventory is 162 units, and in-transit inventory is 402 units (orders from P33 to P36). The total pipeline plus on-hand (564 units) needs to cover the demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). With a mean demand of ~114 units, the expected demand over 5 periods is 570 units. I will use the recent_N method (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock level and order appropriately to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit margin.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 26. For Periods 26 through 37, the average demand is approximately 114.4 units per period (N=12). Prior periods show a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Current inventory stands at 158 units on-hand with 374 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a service level approach based on the critical ratio (q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95), which naturally targets a high service level. Given the regime stability since Period 26, I am using recent_N (N=12) for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current state accurately while ignoring the low-demand valley (P15-P25). Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods, so 'calculate' is appropriate to maintain the average of 4.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 26, following a low-demand phase (Periods 15-25). For the most recent 10-period window (P29-P38), the average demand is 114.5 units per period. The standard deviation over this period is approximately 22.8 units, reflecting significant volatility. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 158 units, with 353 units in transit. Given the high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current mean (~114.5) and volatility accurately while ignoring the previous low-demand period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P26-P38) stable: average demand ~114 units/period, \u03c3 \u2248 22.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 26, characterized by a return to high-demand patterns (P26-P39 average demand: ~111 units, \u03c3 \u2248 22). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since Period 39 ended with an on-hand inventory of 154 units and a pipeline of 338 units, total inventory (492) is well-positioned to meet the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the current high-demand regime starting P26) to maintain responsiveness to current consumption while ignoring the previous low-demand phase (P15-P25).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 40, the average demand is approximately 111.9 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.3. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 111 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 386 units (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend's target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=15 to capture this high-demand regime precisely, and use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 remains stable with an average of approximately 110 units per period, although recent volatility is notable (P41 dropped to 78). The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 450 units. Orders from Periods 38 (87 units), 39 (107 units), 40 (129 units), and 41 (127 units) are in transit and expected to arrive in Periods 42, 43, 44, and 45 respectively. Given the target base stock (calculated as roughly (L+1)*mean + safety stock), the current pipeline (450) plus on-hand (96) equals 546 units, which is slightly above the desired level for the current 110-unit demand regime. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the stable behavior since Period 26, ensuring the OR backend adjusts for the current demand level while maintaining the 4-period lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, following a high-demand pattern similar to the Period 9-14 window. For the last 17 periods (P26-P42), the average demand is approximately 110 units per period. Recent data (P36-P42) shows a slightly lower average of 98 units, but with significant volatility (std dev ~22). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 88 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 435 units (arriving over the next 4 periods), the total pipeline inventory covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the 110 units/period rate. I will use a recent_N of 17 for mu_hat to capture the full recent high-demand regime while allowing the backend to handle the current coverage. A slightly tighter N for sigma_hat (N=7) is used to reflect recent volatility more accurately.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been consistently high since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 107.4 units over the last 18 periods (P26-P43). Although there was a slight dip in demand in Period 43 (63 units), given the high volatility (standard deviation ~23), I should maintain parameters aligned with the established high-demand regime rather than reacting to a single-period outlier. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 132, and in-transit is 426, totaling 558 units. With a lead time of 4, the target pipeline (L+1 periods) should cover demand for Period 44 through 48. Using N=18 (from Period 26 onwards) for mu_hat captures the current regime accurately while smoothing out the recent low sample. This aligns the base stock calculation with the observed stabilized demand pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $939.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 26, but the most recent four periods (P41-P44) have shown a noticeable softening, with demand values of 78, 95, 63, and 60. The average demand for P26-P44 is approximately 104 units, but the last 5 periods average only 71.2 units. This suggests a potential downward shift similar to the one seen in Period 15, or at least a significant increase in volatility. With 201 units on-hand and 347 units in-transit (covering orders from P41 to P44), and a lead time consistently at 4 periods, we are currently over-inventoried if demand continues at the sub-70 level. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this recent downturn and prevent further excess accumulation, while keeping sigma_hat default to maintain a buffer for the high volatility observed throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift downward at Period 41: Average demand for P41-P44 is 74 units, significantly lower than the P26-P40 average of 114 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2272.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern has become highly volatile. While periods 41-44 showed a dip (avg ~74), Period 45 spiked back to 130 units. This suggests we are not in a sustained low-demand regime yet, but rather seeing increased variance around the established 'high' mean of ~114-118. Considering the current on-hand inventory (198) and in-transit (220), we have 418 units to cover demand over the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). At a mean of 115, we need ~575 units; at a mean of 74, we need ~370 units. Given the Period 45 spike, I will set mu_hat based on the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the recent volatility without overreacting to the short-term dip in P41-P44. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=20 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 40: P41-P45 demand values [78, 95, 63, 60, 130] show a wide range, making the previous stable mean of 114 less certain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1670.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows increased volatility starting around Period 41. Demand values for P41-P46 are [78, 95, 63, 60, 130, 97], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 87 units. This is a noticeable shift downward from the P26-P40 high-demand regime, which averaged around 114 units. However, the last two periods (130, 97) suggest the demand is not staying at the extreme low seen in P43-P44. Given we are at Period 47 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, our goal is to manage the current inventory (173 units) and in-transit pipe (292 units) to cover the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50). Total units available (465) far exceed the expected demand for 4 periods (approx 4 * 90 = 360). I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to reflect the current volatile but lower mean, and use sigma_hat from the same period to account for the increased variance (standard deviation approx 25-27), ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order given the high current stock of 173 and significant in-transit quantities.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: Average demand for P41-P46 softened to 87 units (from 114) with higher relative volatility (std dev ~26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2169.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 41. Prior to Period 41, the average demand (P26-P40) was approximately 114 units. For the most recent 7 periods (P41-P47), the average demand has decreased to 92.1 units with significant volatility (values ranging from 60 to 130). I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat of 7 periods to capture this downward shift and the increased volatility while ignoring the previous high-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory (149) and in-transit units (261, totaling 410) are relatively high compared to the current 7-period demand average. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand shift starting Period 41: Average demand decreased from ~114 units to ~92 units (P41-P47) with increased volatility (Std Dev ~26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1401.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the objective is to manage the 'chips(Regular)' SKU during a period of sustained but volatile demand that shifted around Period 41. Recent history (P41-P48) shows an average demand of approximately 91 units with a standard deviation of 25.4. This is a decrease from the previous high-demand regime of ~114 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 119, with 348 units in transit (orders from P45-P48). Total pipeline inventory is 467 units. Based on an L+1=5 period horizon and an average demand of 91, the expected demand is 455 units. The current pipeline of 467 units is sufficient to cover this. However, since the service level target (critical ratio) is high (0.95), and recent volatility is significant, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current regime) to capture the lower mean and higher volatility accurately, allowing the OR backend to determine if additional units are needed to buffer against spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs near the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2261.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 41 has shown a lower mean (~92 units) compared to the prior high-demand period (~114 units), but remains highly volatile (standard deviation ~26). Period 49 demand was 119, depleting all on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 429 units, which is approximately enough to cover 4.6 periods of demand at the current average. Since the required base stock must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, I will use recent statistics from the Period 41 changepoint (N=9, including the current Period 49 observation) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we don't over-order based on the older, higher demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for the current volatility.
