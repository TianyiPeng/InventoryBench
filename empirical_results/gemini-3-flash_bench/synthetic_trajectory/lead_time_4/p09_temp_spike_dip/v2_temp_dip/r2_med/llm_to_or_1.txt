Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical mean demand of approximately 100 units (based on samples 118, 130, 72, 58, 121; mean = 99.8). The promised lead time is 4 periods. In-transit and on-hand inventory are both 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system will naturally target a high service level (around 80% based on the logic q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8). I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all 5 provided historical demand samples for the initial order. Since no arrivals have occurred yet, there is no evidence to deviate from the promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, zero units arrived in the first period, and since starting inventory was 0, we had 114 units of lost sales. Historical demand across the first 5 periods (including the pre-game history) shows values of 118, 130, 72, 58, 121, resulting in a mean of 99.8. Since total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 154 and our target base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) should be approximately 5 * 100 = 500 units, we are currently severely under-stocked. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 available historical samples to stabilize the forecast, and use the default promised lead time of 4 until we observe actual arrivals to confirm any drift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Due to the promised lead time of 4 periods, no orders placed in Periods 1 or 2 should have arrived yet (they are expected in Periods 5 and 6, respectively). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 306 units in-transit (154 from P1 + 152 from P2). Demand for the first two periods was 114 and 117, which is very close to the historical samples provided (118, 130, 72, 58, 121). Since no lead-time events have concluded yet, I will stick to the 'default' lead time (4) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters. I'll use N=5 for demand to capture the local mean while acknowledging the full historical sample set contains moderate variance. The goal is to maintain a pipeline that covers the 5-period window (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (deciding for orders placed at the start of Period 5). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history shows that orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 have not yet arrived. This is consistent with the promised lead time: an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 arrives during Period 5 (visible at P6 start). Thus, on-hand remains 0, and we have suffered lost sales for Periods 1-4. The in-transit inventory is 154 (P1) + 152 (P2) + 145 (P3) = 451. Demand is relatively stable: P1: 114, P2: 117, P3: 103, and user provided P1-P5 samples as [118, 130, 72, 58, 121]. Averaging all available samples (114, 117, 103 from history, plus we acknowledge the trend in the sample list), the mean is approx 100. Since we are in the initial phase and lead time is long, we use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent volatility while building pipeline inventory to cover the 4-period lead time.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 562 units in transit (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand over the first 5 periods is: 118, 130, 72, 58, 121 (mean: 99.8, std: 31.9). However, demand reported in the 'conclude' messages for P1-P4 (114, 117, 103, 106) averages roughly 110. Combining these, the demand seems relatively stable around 100-110 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using L=4, mu_hat should reflect 5 * 105 = 525. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial behavior while the pipeline fills. Since on-hand is 0 and we are nearing the first arrival, maintaining the default parameters is the safest approach to avoid over-ordering before confirming the lead time and arrival consistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $506.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5 (lead_time = 4). Demand has been relatively stable across the first 5 periods: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132 (Mean \u2248 114.4, Std \u2248 11.4). The pipeline currently contains orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 (totaling 152+145+111+14 = 422 units). Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 22. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 444. Using the full history (N=5) for demand forecasting is appropriate as no clear regime shift is yet confirmed, although Period 5's demand was slightly higher. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level and generate an order that accounts for the units already in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 6 periods is [114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80], averaging 108.67. Arrivals from Period 1 and 2 arrived exactly with a lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand is 94, with 404 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods, I will use lead time (L) = 4. To calculate mu_hat, I will use all available demand samples (N=6) to estimate demand over the window (1+L) = 5 periods. 108.67 * 5 = 543.35. For sigma_hat, I will use the standard deviation of all samples (approx 17.5) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which the backend handles with the 'default' method. This strategy maintains a stable base stock to cover demand until the next expected arrival.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72. The mean demand is approximately 103 units. The Carry-over Insights and recent arrival data (orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7 respectively) confirm the actual lead time L=4, matching the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 331 units, which consists of orders from P4 (111), P5 (14), P6 (134), and P7 (72). We expect the P4 order (111 units) to arrive during Period 8. Current on-hand inventory is 167. Given the demand variability and the 4-period lead time, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all 7 samples (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a stable estimate of the baseline demand as there is no clear evidence of a significant regime shift yet, although recent demand (80, 72) has been lower.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by the delivery of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Demand has been relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 8 periods. Recent demand (last 3 periods) shows a slight dip (87.3) compared to the overall average, but given the volatility (range 72-132), I will use the last 5 periods to capture a more balanced mean (98.8). Current inventory (On-hand: 168, In-transit: 279) is healthy. The pipeline includes orders from Period 5 (14 units), Period 6 (134 units), Period 7 (72 units), and Period 8 (59 units), totaling 279 units. These are expected to arrive in Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12. I will set L to 4 using the 'calculate' method as it matches historical performance. Mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the moderate demand level, and Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the standard volatility seen across the full game history.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 5. Demand history shows some fluctuations but suggests a mean around 100 units (samples: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72, 110, 77). The mean of all 9 completed periods is 99 units. Since there's no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, I will use a larger sample size for stability. I'll set N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent history. With L=4, the base stock targets window is (L+1)=5 periods. On-hand (105) + In-transit (355) = 460 units. Given an average demand of 100, we have about 4.6 periods of supply, which is close to our target cycle. No shipments are currently flagged as lost or overdue.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 11. Historical analysis shows a stable demand pattern with an average of approximately 100 units per period (range 72-132). The carry-over insight correctly identified the actual lead time (L) as 4 periods, which has been consistent for all 6 arriving shipments (P1 through P6). Current on-hand inventory is 150 units with 306 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed as the actual lead time, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full operational history since arrivals began, ensuring the base stock level covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). This approach balances the stock-out risk against the $1.0 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Analysis of the historical data confirms the lead time is stable at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from Periods 5 through 11). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean. Specifically, the demand samples from Period 1 to 11 are: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72, 110, 77, 89, 96. The average demand across these 11 periods is approximately 99.6. However, looking at the last 6 periods (since the lead time effects stabilized), the demand seems slightly lower (avg ~87.3). I will use recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect this recent demand regime and avoid over-ordering based on the higher initial demand periods. The target inventory level (base stock) needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an on-hand of 126 and in-transit of 316, our pipeline is 442. The OR backend will use the provided recent_N statistics to determine if additional orders are necessary given the service level requirements (q = 0.8).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 13. Based on the game history from Period 5 through Period 12, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods (matches promised). In-transit inventory is 279 units (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Average demand over the 12 observed periods is approximately 100 units/period (mean = 100.25). Recent demand (last 4 periods) is slightly more stable around 93 units. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting we should aim for a service level that captures a significant portion of the demand variance. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at 4, and 'recent_N' with N=12 for demand parameters to capture the full range of observed behavior since the initial stocking phase, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the (1+L) window (5 periods of demand).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 14. Historical demand over the first 13 periods shows a mean of approximately 98 units per period, with a standard deviation of roughly 19 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory currently consists of 91 units on-hand and 318 units in-transit (orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13). Since the demand appears relatively stable with no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals in the numerical data provided (Period_N dates), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the most recent stability in demand while smoothing out early noise. This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 samples (Periods 4-13). For lead time L, I will use 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 90 units, and the in-transit pipeline is 332 units (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14). Demand in the last 10 periods (P5-P14) has averaged 92.6 units, showing a slight decrease and stabilization compared to the initial high variance samples. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals from P5 through P14. Given the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 422) and an expected demand over the lead time and review period (5 periods) of roughly 463 units, a slight replenishment is likely needed. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime and use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time since the historical arrivals are very consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent increase, with Period 15 recording 134 units, significantly higher than the previous 8-period mean of approximately 92. The promised and actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. With only 38 units on-hand and 325 in-transit (orders from P12-P15), we need to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the uptick in the most recent periods, I am choosing 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand level while smoothing out the earlier lower-demand period. Lead time remains 'default' at 4. Sigma is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 17. Looking at the arrival history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated in the carry-over insights and consistent through to the P12 order arriving in P16). Demand has fluctuated between 40 and 134 units in the last 12 periods. The most recent demand (Period 16) was quite low (40), but the period before was high (134). On-hand inventory is currently low (20), but pipeline (in-transit) is healthy (426). The pipeline includes orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16. Using the promised lead time of 4 (total coverage needed for L+1 = 5 periods), the pipeline inventory (426) + on-hand (20) = 446. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approx 88.6 per period. 5 * 88.6 = 443. This suggests we are generally well-positioned. I will use the last 12 periods of demand (since the start of consistent arrivals) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variability while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant downward shift over the last three periods (P15: 134, P16: 40, P17: 33) compared to the historical average of approximately 95 units per period. The average over the last three periods is approximately 69, reflecting this drop. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P13 order arrived P17). With an on-hand inventory of 116 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 358 units, the system is currently over-inventoried relative to this new lower demand regime. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level aligned with the high profit margin (q = 0.8), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand trend. L remains at the promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Avg demand decreased from ~96 to ~36.5 over the last two periods, following a peak of 134 in P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant drop starting around Period 16. While Period 18 saw a slight rebound to 67 units, the average over the last three periods (40, 33, 67) is 46.67, which is much lower than the historical average (~96). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (148 units) and substantial in-transit stock (259 units), the pipeline inventory is currently 407 units. To prevent excessive holding costs during this lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent average of ~47 units per period. This gives a (1+L) * mean target of (1+4) * 46.67 = 233.35, which is well below the current pipeline, likely resulting in a zero order for this period to drain excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent: Average demand over P16-P18 is 46.7 units, a ~50% reduction from the previous long-term average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from P1 to P15 was approximately 97 units, but the average for the last four periods (P16-P19) has dropped to 46.5 units (40, 33, 67, 46). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 177 and in-transit at 184, the total inventory position is 361 units. Given the new demand regime, 361 units effectively covers over 7 periods of demand (361 / 46.5 \u2248 7.7), which exceeds the required protection level for a L=4 system (covering L+1=5 periods). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am selecting 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current lower mean, and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect current variance. The OR backend will likely order 0 units due to the high inventory position relative to the new demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: Average demand P16-P19 is 46.5 units, down ~52% from the initial 15-period average of 97.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 97 units. From Period 16 to Period 20, the average demand dropped to 49.6 units (40, 33, 67, 46, 62). This represents a decrease of nearly 50%. The current on-hand inventory is 238 units, which is quite high given this new demand level. With an additional 61 units in-transit (ordered in Period 17, expected to arrive in Period 21), the total pipeline and on-hand inventory is 299 units. At the current demand rate of ~50 units/period, this covers roughly 6 periods of demand, which exceeds the required coverage for a 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering, keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 remains consistent, though recent data (Period 21) shows a slight uptick to 85. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 55.5, which is significantly lower than the pre-P16 average of ~97. Current on-hand inventory is 214 units, and there are no units in-transit. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, our planning horizon is 5 periods (L+1). Based on the recent average of 55.5, expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 277.5 units. Given that on-hand inventory is already 214 and the holding cost is $1.0 vs. $4.0 profit (service level 80%), we are well-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the new demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time as the performance has been stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 16. The average demand for periods 16-22 is approximately 53.3 units, compared to the earlier average of ~97. Recent demand (P19-P22) has been [46, 62, 85, 40], averaging 58.25 units. Although P21 was a bit higher (85), P22 returned to 40. On-hand inventory is currently high at 174 units, which combined with 88 units in-transit (ordered P22, expected P26), equals 262 units. With the promised and observed lead time L=4, the base stock (target inventory for L+1=5 periods) should cover roughly 5 * 55 = 275 units. Since 262 is already close to this and current on-hand is high (174), I will use the recent lower demand regime (N=7, covering P16-P22) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to 23 is approximately 52.4 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~97. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is 59 units. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms a consistent actual lead time of 4. Since Period 18, order quantities were zeros followed by 88 and 40, leading to an on-hand inventory of 128 and in-transit of 128 (orders from P22 and P23). I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the low-demand regime from P16-P23) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the inventory levels are adjusted to the current lower-demand environment (approx 52 units/period) rather than the historical highs, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a sufficient base stock for the L+1 window.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established. From Period 16 to 24, the average demand is 55.3 units, compared to the initial 15-period average of 97. Recent demand (P22-P24) shows values of 40, 46, and 79 (avg 55). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. However, no orders have arrived for high-index periods (P18-P21 had 'ordered=0', explaining the 'arrived=0' in P22-P24). The 'In-transit' of 167 accounts for orders from P22, P23, and P24 (88+40+39=167), plus the pending arrival from P18-21 (which were all 0). I will use a recent_N of 9 for demand (covering the move to the new regime since P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the lower mean with the observed volatility. The lead time method remains 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 remains sustained: P16-P24 average is 55.3 units (~43% lower than P1-P15 average).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is well-established. The average demand from Period 16 to 24 is approximately 55.3 units, compared to the initial 15-period average of 97. Period 25 recorded zero demand, which I will treat as an outlier or potentially a data reporting gap, but it reinforces the need to avoid over-ordering given the current high in-transit levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders from Periods 18-21 were zero units, which explains the lack of arrivals in Periods 22-25. Arrivals will resume in Period 26 (order from P22). On-hand inventory is 49 with 253 units in-transit. The total pipeline (302) is sufficient to cover demand for the next (L+1)=5 periods at the current regime average (approx 55 * 5 = 275). I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P16-P24) to capture the lower demand mean and variance while smoothing the P25 anomaly.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is well-established; however, the most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) show a slight increase in average demand (approx. 55.8 units/period) compared to the immediate post-shift trough, including a spike to 114 in P26. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P22 order in P26. We are currently tracking an in-transit inventory of 165 units (orders from P23, P24, P25), with the P23 order (40 units) expected to arrive in Period 27. On-hand inventory is low at 23 units. Given the critical 114 demand in P26, I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat (covering the stable lower-demand regime since P16) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current levels rather than long-term historical highs, while maintaining a default sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility seen in P24 and P26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16, but has recently shown a significant and volatile rebound (P26: 114, P27: 100). The average demand from P22-P27 (excluding the anomalous zero in P25) is approximately 79.8 units. The on-hand inventory is currently depleted (0 units). While in-transit inventory is 235 units, we must account for the recent volume spike to avoid stockouts, especially since we just lost sales in P27. The order from P24 (39 units) is expected to arrive in P28, and the order from P25 (86 units) in P29. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the upward trend since P22 while ignoring the P25 outlier in my logic, although the backend will include it. This balances the lower demand of P16-P21 with the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 26: demand spiked to 100+ units after a period of low demand (P16-P24 avg ~55), suggesting a potential second regime shift or seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear regime shift back to high demand. From P16 to P24, the average demand was approximately 55 units. However, beginning in P26, demand spiked to 114, followed by 100 in P27 and 117 in P28. This signals a return to the initial high-demand levels (avg ~97 in P1-P15) or potentially higher. Currently, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0) and experienced lost sales in P27 and P28. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P22, P23, P24 all arrived with L=4). To recover service levels and meet the renewed demand, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this immediate high-demand spike (avg ~110 over the last 3 periods) while maintaining a lead time of 4. This will set a higher base stock to clear the current stockout and adequately cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Demand returned to high levels, averaging 110.3 over P26-P28, compared to 55.3 during the P16-P25 low-period. Stockouts occurred in P27 and P28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly entered a new high-demand regime starting around Period 26. After a low-demand period (P16-P25), the average demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) is 98.0 units (114, 100, 117, 61), which is close to the initial high-demand phase (P1-P15 avg: 97.4). However, recent stockouts in P27 and P28 indicate that our safety stock was insufficient to cover this volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P22-P25 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high demand volatility, I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand regime. This period (P30) also marks four periods since the high-demand orders started (P26-P29), meaning the pipeline inventory is quite high (370 units), which the OR backend will subtract from the base stock. By focusing on the last 4 samples, we ensure the forecast reflects the current high-demand environment (~98 units/period) rather than the long-term history which includes the P16-P25 slump.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 26. Since Period 26, demand has been 114, 100, 117, 61, and 133, averaging 105 units per period. This is a significant increase from the low-demand period (P16-P25) which averaged ~55 units. Due to this shift and lead time delays, the system has experienced stockouts in P27, P28, and P30, leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. My goal is to use the recent high-demand data to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to restore inventory levels. Specifically, mu_hat will be based on the last 5 periods (avg ~105 * 5 = 525) to reflect the current regime. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Average demand P26-P30 is 105.0 units, returning to or exceeding the initial P1-P15 levels (~97) after a low-demand period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, returning to high levels. Since P26, the average demand is 101.5 (P26-P31), which is comparable to the initial P1-P15 average of 97. We observed stockouts in P27, P28, and P30, indicating that our pipeline was insufficient for this higher demand level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime (P26-P31). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the current period. This will ensure the base stock level is high enough to satisfy the returned demand and rebuild inventory after the recent stockouts.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 26, after a low-demand period between P16-P25. The current average demand for this new regime (P26-P32) is approximately 96 units, which is consistent with the initial period's average. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 98, and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 397 units (ordered in P29, P30, P31, P32). Since the promised lead time L=4 is reliable, I will use L=4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P26-P32), which accurately reflects the return to higher consumption levels. Sigma_hat will also be set using recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. These settings help balance the stock to meet high demand while managing the large incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P26-P32) average confirmed at 95.9 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted back to a high-demand regime starting around Period 26, after a low-demand period (P16-P25). The average demand from Period 26 to Period 33 is approximately 86.1 units, but with significant volatility (highs of 133 and 114). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent observations. Currently, we have 166 units on-hand and 308 in-transit (orders from P30-P33). Since the high-demand regime (P26-P33) is now well-established (8 periods of data), I am using a recent_N approach with N=8 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher volume and variance efficiently, ensuring the base stock level targets the (L+1) period window to avoid further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a higher regime since Period 26, following a low-demand slump (P16-P25). The current high-demand regime (P26-P34) shows an average demand of approximately 92.4 units per period (114, 100, 117, 61, 133, 84, 62, 58, 93). While some recent volatility exists (dropping to around 60 units in P32 and P33 before rebounding to 93 in P34), setting parameters based on this recent high-demand window (N=9) is appropriate to maintain a high service level and prevent the stockouts observed in P27-P30. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With high on-hand (214) and significant in-transit inventory (204), the goal is to stabilize the base stock around the current demand mean while accounting for lead time variance.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 26. Analyzing the recent 10 periods (P26-P35), the average demand is 93.4 units (stdev ~27.8), which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand phase (P16-P25 avg ~55). The on-hand inventory is healthy at 228 units, with another 228 units in-transit (orders from P32, P33, P34, P35). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the most recent conclusion (P31 order arrived P35). I will use the recent 10-period window to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's mean and volatility while maintaining the default lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) without over-ordering as the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (post-Period 26) sustained: Period 26-35 average demand is 93.4 units, with standard deviation of 27.8.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 26, following a lower-demand period (P16-P25). The average demand from Period 26 to 36 is approximately 93.5 units (sum: 1029 / 11 periods). The last few periods (P31-P36) show a relatively consistent mean despite some volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 198 units, and in-transit inventory is 199. To maintain this balance and avoid the stockouts seen in P27-P30, I will use the last 11 samples (P26-P36) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, representing the current regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 5-period demand (L+1) while accounting for the observed volatility in this regime.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 26. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the average demand is 91.5 units, which is consistent with the pre-Period 16 levels (~97) and significantly higher than the mid-game slump (~55). The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 26.0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P37 of the P33 order. Current on-hand inventory is 173 units, and the pipeline is 257. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is 80%. I will use recent_N (N=12) for both demand mean and volatility to capture the current regime's behavior while filtering out the older, irrelevant low-demand period. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 90+ unit average demand across the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted back to a high-demand state starting at Period 26. Since then (P26-P38), the average demand is approximately 89.2 units per period, with significant variability (StdDev ~31.1). Recent demand has been fluctuates between 52 and 105. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical 'conclude' messages (e.g., P34 order arrived in P38). Currently, on-hand inventory is 105 units and in-transit is 270 units, totaling 375 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4 and the current period (L+1=5), we need to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (~446 units). Since 375 < 446, an order is necessary. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime at P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current mean and volatility while ignoring the previous low-demand period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained in a high-demand state, averaging 86.8 units over the last 14 periods (P26-P39) with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. In the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), the average is slightly lower at 85.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at the promised level of 4 periods. With only 11 periods remaining in the game (P40-P50), I will use the recent 14-period average to capture the current high-demand regime while ensuring parameters account for its volatility. The 'recent_N' method with N=14 allows the OR engine to use the mean of this stable high-demand period to set the base stock for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. Current on-hand is 83 and in-transit is 292, which covers the expected 5-period demand (approx 434 units), but additional orders are needed to maintain safety stock and prevent stockouts seen earlier in this regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime since Period 26 stable: P26-P39 average demand is 86.8 units (std ~27), contrasting with the low-demand P16-P25 average of 55.4 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 26, returning to high levels. Over the last 15 periods (P26-P40), the average demand is approximately 88.0 units with a standard deviation of 27.6. Recently, demand has been consistently high (P38-P40 average is 107). I will use a recent_N window of 15 periods to capture this current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P36 order arrived in P40). Pipeline inventory (377) combined with on-hand (14) is currenty 391 units. With a lead time of 4, the system must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 440 units, but the OR backend's capping logic will regulate any excessive ordering based on the parameters provided.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the high-demand regime that began in Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 87.8 units per period (P26-P41), with demand in the most recent periods (P38-P41) being 105, 112, 104, and 129. We are currently facing stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P41), indicating that our current base stock levels are insufficient for this high-demand phase. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=16 to capture this entire high-demand regime (P26-P41), and sigma_hat using recent_N=16 to reflect the volatility of this period (std dev ~26). This should signal the OR backend to raise the base stock level to satisfy the current demand pull and minimize lost sales.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-regime phase that started around Period 26. Over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 115.8 units, which is slightly higher than the Period 26-39 average of 86.8 units, indicating a recent upward trend. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P41 and P42. The pipeline inventory is healthy at 463 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 17 periods (P26-P42) for statistical parameters balances the high-demand regime's mean (~93 units) and volatility. Setting N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this regime effectively. L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 remains high and has recently increased; P38-P42 average is 115.8 units compared to P26-P37 average of 84.8 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift since Period 26, further intensifying since Period 38. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P38-P43) is 113.8 units, compared to the P26-P37 average of 84.8. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent history (P39 order arrived P43). Currently, on-hand inventory is critically low (8 units) due to stockouts in P41 and P42. PIPeline inventory (413 units) is substantial, but includes orders from P40-P43 which are yet to arrive. To ensure a high service level (profit/holding cost ratio is 4:1) for this growing demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 samples to capture the recent intensification and sigma_hat using the last 15 samples to capture the volatility of the entire high-demand regime since P26. L is set to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification within high-regime: P38-P43 average demand is 113.8 units (+34% vs P26-P37 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has intensified recently. Starting around Period 38, we entered a high-demand sub-regime. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P38-P44) is 109.6 units, compared to the broader post-P26 average of 86.8. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend targets a service level of 80%. We are currently experiencing supply tightness with on-hand inventory at 44 and recurring stockouts (P41, P42). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture this recent intensification, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the ~110 units/period average (and account for L+1=5 periods of demand coverage). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. This will ensure the base stock is elevated enough to prevent stockouts during the current high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification continues: P38-P44 average demand is 109.6 units, sustained for 7 periods, significantly higher than the P26-P37 average of 84.8.

The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime that intensified around Period 38.

The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (24 units), so we need to ensure the pipeline (426 units) + current order covers the (L+1) period window. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat (N=8 covers the P38-P45 intensification) and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat provides the most accurate reflection of current volatility and volume. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on these parameters to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification since P38 confirmed: P38-P45 average demand is 111.9 units, significantly higher than the P26-P37 average of 84.8.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-intensity regime that began around Period 38. Over the last 9 periods (P38-P46), the average demand is approximately 113.3 units (105, 112, 104, 129, 129, 104, 84, 128, 119), which is a significant increase from the previous regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals (P42, P43, P44, P45, P46). On-hand inventory is low (28 units), but there is a large pipeline (442 units) currently in transit across Periods 43, 44, 45, and 46. To address the higher demand level and prevent stockouts while balancing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 periods (recent_N=9) to capture this intensification accurately. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=9 to reflect the current volatility (std dev in this period is approx 15.6). L is set to default (promised 4), as the actual lead time has matched the promised lead time perfectly for the duration of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification since P38 confirmed: P38-P46 average demand is 113.3 units, compared to P26-P37 average of 84.8.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that intensified around Period 38. The average demand since Period 38 (P38-P47) is approximately 111.9 units, with recent periods consistently exceeding 100 units. A stockout occurred in Period 47, leaving 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and current zero inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current high-intensification phase (avg ~112) while providing enough safety stock via sigma_hat (recent_N=10) to prevent further stockouts. This corresponds to the OR backend calculating a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification since Period 38 confirmed: P38-P47 average demand is 111.9 units (std ~15.5), significantly higher than the P26-P37 average of 84.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $245.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-intensity regime that started around Period 38. From P38 to P48, the average demand is 110.1 units (114, 112, 104, 129, 129, 104, 84, 128, 119, 101, 81), which is significantly higher than the previous high-regime average (P26-P37) of 84.8 units. The most recent demand (P48) was 81, which is on the lower end of this regime's range but doesn't yet signal a downward shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P48 of the P44 order. Given we are at P49 of 50, this is the final ordering decision. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the intensified demand of the last 11 periods. Sigma_hat will also use N=11 to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter remains at default (4). Inventory is currently well-supported by 426 units in-transit, but high base stock parameters are necessary to maintain service levels during this final period's demand resolution.

Daily Profit: $364.00, Daily Holding Cost: $69.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility, high-volume regime since Period 38. Over the last 12 periods (P38-P49), the average demand is approximately 107.3 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. This is significantly higher than the mid-game period (P16-P25) and slightly higher than the initial phase. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P45 order arriving in P49). I will use a recent_N window of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current intensification. With an on-hand inventory of 69 and a significant pipeline (416 units), the OR parameters must balance the risk of stockouts during spikes against the holding cost of $1.0. Given the high criticality (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a service level around 80% is mathematically targeted by the backend, which my parameters will support by reflecting the current high-demand mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification since P38 remains stable: P38-P49 average demand is 107.3 units (std ~15.6), representing a sustained high-demand phase.
