Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit for 'chips(Regular)'. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The initial demand samples provided (Period 1-5) show an average demand of approximately 107.4 units (mean of [146, 110, 112, 150, 59]). Since we are at the very beginning of the simulation (Period 1), I will use 'default' methods for Lead Time (L), mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This allows the OR backend to calculate initial base stock levels based on the promised lead time and the statistical properties of all provided historical demand samples. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), the service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will naturally be high, encouraging the backend to order enough to cover the lead time demand plus safety stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 176 units was placed, but it has not arrived yet as the lead time is greater than 0. The demand in Period 1 was 140, while current on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales. I see historical demand samples for 5 periods, but the game is currently only at Period 2 (the user provided sample data suggests a mean of ~107). Since we have no arrivals yet to check actual lead time, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4). For demand (mu_hat), the mean of the 5 samples is 107.4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the provided sample window) to capture this level. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed volatility (~34). The OR backend will calculate base stock for a lead time of 4 plus the current period (L+1=5).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (176 units) and Period 2 (173 units) are currently in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. This explains the current on-hand inventory of 0 and the resulting lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. The historical demand samples provided (P1: 146, P2: 110, P3: 112, P4: 150, P5: 59) show significant variance, but the game history for concluded periods (P1: 140, P2: 136) suggests a relatively stable initial demand around 138 units/period. Since no arrivals have occurred yet, there is no evidence to override the promised lead time (L=4). Using recent_N for demand parameters (N=2 based on concluded history) to capture the early demand level while lead time is set to default (4). The backend will calculate base_stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 4 periods. The history shows we have placed orders in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (176, 173, and 187 units respectively), totaling 536 units in transit. Since the lead time is 4, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have recorded lost sales because no stock has arrived yet. The historical demand for Periods 1-3 was 140, 136, and 92 (average ~122). Demand samples provided in the prompt (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) show some volatility. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand with N=5 (using the provided samples) to capture the recent mean, and 'default' for lead time since no orders have concluded yet to prove a shift from the promised 4 periods. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6 (receiving news of Period 5). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (176 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which I will see at the start of Period 6. History for Period 5 shows demand was 59. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 715. Since the promised lead time is 4, I expect the first arrival in the next 'conclude' message. Demand has shown a downward trend (140, 136, 92, 58, 59). I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture this lower volume accurately, as using the full history would overestimate demand. I keep L at default (4) until a conclusion message confirms otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2184.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the start of Period 5 (after Period 5's decision), resulting in an ending inventory of 58 units. The actual lead time for this shipment was 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, due to the arrival sequence, we have experienced significant stockouts from Period 1 to Period 4. Demand has shown high variability (ranging from 58 to 140) with a mean around 109 units. Currently, there are 539 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4), which is substantial compared to historical demand. The OR backend needs to maintain a pipeline that covers L+1 (5) periods of demand. Given the stockout history, I will use recent trends to stabilize the forecast. I will set mu_hat based on the mean of the 5 available demand samples (~109 per period, so ~544 for L+1) and use the standard deviation of those samples for sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1889.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude' confirms the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 125, with 439 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, P6). Historical demand samples (including pre-game and game history) are: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59 (pre-game) and 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106 (game). There is a noticeable decline in demand starting around Period 3/4. The mean of all 11 samples is 111.5, but the mean of the last 5 periods (deciding since P2) is lower (approx 102). Given the stability of the lead time at 4 periods, I will set L to default. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent lower demand trend while maintaining enough samples for stability across the (L+1)=5 period horizon. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1608.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently matching the promised lead time of 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Period 5, 6, and 7 from orders placed in Period 1, 2, and 3). Current On-hand inventory is 216 units, and 343 units are in-transit (orders from P4, P6, and P7). Demand has shown a slight downward trend and stabilization: P1-P4 mean was ~106.5, while P5-P7 mean is ~106.6. However, looking at the recent 5 periods (P3-P7), the average demand is 94. It is safer to use a slightly more recent window to capture the drop observed from P4 onwards compared to the initial periods. I will use recent_N=5 for both demand and volatility to provide a stable but responsive inventory target that accounts for the 4-period lead time. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (q=0.95), justifying the use of a robust sigma_hat to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2045.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Orders from P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8 respectively, all with lead_time=4). There are currently 164 units in transit, which correspond to orders from P6 (73 units) and P7 (91 units). Orders from P5 and P8 were 0, so no arrivals are expected in P9 or P12. Demand has been relatively stable with no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals based on the generic period labels. The average demand across all 8 concluded periods is approximately 108.5. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the stable mean across the available history. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=8. Since the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use the default method for L.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1-P4 orders arrived P5-P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1947.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1-P4 all arrived exactly at P(N+4)). The order from P5 was 0, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 9 conclusion. We have orders from P6 (73), P7 (91), and P9 (153) currently in-transit, totaling 317 units. Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 109 units over the last 9 periods. The most recent demand was 111. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the mean demand of 108.7 units and apply the 4-period lead time. This ensures our base stock covers demand over the L+1 = 5 period window (approx. 544 units). With 162 on-hand and 317 in-transit (Total 479), the backend should order roughly 65 units to meet the target.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 142 units on-hand and 394 units in-transit. Based on the history, the actual lead time L=4 is consistently confirmed (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 arrived exactly 4 periods later). There was no order placed in Period 5, explaining the lack of arrival in Period 9 conclude. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability without strong seasonal evidence yet. The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 107.2 units, with the most recent Period 10 demand being 93. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. The set L is kept at 'default' since the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders in P1-P4 and P6-P7). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable, ranging between 58 and 140 units, with an average of approximately 107 units over the last 11 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 131, and in-transit is 392 (orders from P9, P10, and P11). Note that Period 5 had an order of 0, and Period 8 had an order of 0, which means no arrivals are expected in Period 9 and Period 12 respectively. Since we are in the decision phase of Period 12, the zero order from P8 will result in 0 arrivals during Period 12's arrival resolution. I will use a recent_N approach (N=11) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full experienced demand profile while acknowledging the stable lead time of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for L+1 (5) periods of demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. The promised lead time is 4. Historical data (P5-P8, P10-P11) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The order from P5 is notably missing (ordered on P5, should have arrived in P9 conclude/P10 start) and likely lost. The order from P8 is also missing (ordered on P8, should have arrived in P12 conclude/P13 start). Demand is relatively stable. Let's look at the sample statistics: all demand samples (P1-P12) have a mean of approximately 105. However, there has been a slight downward trend in very recent periods (P10: 93, P11: 102, P12: 73). I will use a restricted window of recent samples (N=8) to capture the stable middle section and the recent dip, avoiding the volatile early-game numbers. Given L=4, we need coverage for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~100/period, we need roughly 500 units in the system. Current on-hand (58) + In-transit (487) = 545. This indicates we are sufficiently stocked if the in-transit units arrive as expected, but since we suspect lost shipments (P5 and P8), the OR engine needs to track the pipeline correctly. Setting L=4 (explicit) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on recent periods will focus the backend on the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 5 and Period 8 confirmed lost or significantly delayed (exceeded promised lead time of 4). Demand regime stable with mean ~105, recently trending lower (~90 last 3 periods).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe a sustained decrease in demand. The mean demand for the first 11 periods was ~107, but the last three periods (P11-P13) dropped significantly to 102, 73, and 55 (avg ~77). We use a recent N=3 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend and avoid over-ordering, especially since we have 156 units on hand and 360 in transit. Regarding lead times, while the promised lead time is 4, we have confirmed logistical failures: orders from Period 5 and Period 8 never arrived (they should have arrived by P9 and P12 respectively). This strongly suggests a 20-30% loss rate or severe disruption. To compensate for the 'missing' inventory in the pipeline, I am setting L=explicit to 6. By increasing the effective lead time used in the base stock calculation, the OR engine will maintain a higher target inventory to buffer against the risk of future lost shipments, even with the declining demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: mean dropped from ~107 to ~77 (-28%) over last 3 periods. Logistics instability confirmed: Orders from P5 and P8 lost/undelivered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1654.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the logistics situation remains unstable. Orders from Period 5 and Period 8 are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the promised lead time of 4 and subsequent orders (P6, P7, P9, P10) have already arrived. Demand continues to show a downward shift. The mean demand for the first 10 periods was ~107. Since Period 11, the demand sequence is [102, 73, 55, 98], averaging ~82 units. I will set N=4 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime (Period 11-14). The in-transit inventory of 336 units includes orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14. Given the loss of P5 and P8, I will maintain the lead time (L) at the promised value of 4, as recent arrivals from P9 and P10 arrived exactly in 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=4 will capture the recent volatility within this lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime lower mean confirmed: Period 11-14 avg is 82 units vs previous avg of 107. Shipment losses for P5 and P8 are permanent; recent system reliability (P9, P10) shows L=4 is still the active lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16 with a confirmed promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since Period 11, demand has shifted significantly lower, with the last 5 periods (P11-P15) averaging 81 units, compared to the earlier average of ~107 units. Logistics issues (lost shipments for P5 and P8) seem to have stabilized based on arrivals from P9, P10, and P11 following the standard L=4 schedule. On-hand inventory is high at 220 units. In-transit inventory stands at 247 units (from orders in P12, P13, and P14), which accounts for the P12 order arriving this period. Given the lower demand regime and high existing pipeline, I will use recent statistics (N=6, covering the shift from P10 onwards) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will lower the base stock level and prevent over-ordering while holding costs are a concern (~$1/unit/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5785.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, a massive demand spike occurred (305 units), departing significantly from the recent average of ~82. This aligns with potential seasonal or event-based behavior, depleting on-hand inventory to 10 units. While previous insights indicated a downward trend, this spike necessitates a defensive restocking posture. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on orders from P9-P12 arriving exactly on time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the recent regime which now includes both the low-demand periods and the massive spike, resulting in a more robust forecast for potential recurring high demand. Sigma_hat is set with N=6 to account for the dramatically increased volatility introduced by the Period 16 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand spike observed in Period 16 (305 units), breaking the previous low-demand regime (~80 units). Pipeline reliability for non-lost orders remains stable at L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $684.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a massive regime shift starting in Period 16, with demand jumping from an average of ~80-100 to over 300 (P16: 305, P17: 322). Period 17 demand was only partially satisfied (sold 36) due to an inventory stockout (starting on-hand 36, demand 322). The pipeline of 412 units includes the large order of 272 units from P17 (expected in P21) and 126 units from P14 (expected this period, P18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for successful shipments. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to 1500 to cover (L+1)=5 periods of this high-demand regime (5 * ~300) to ensure the OR backend aggressive targets enough stock to recover from the current stockout. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value to account for the heightened volatility during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand spike confirmed: Period 16-17 avg demand is ~313, a ~300% increase over the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for current active shipments.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 305, 322, and 219, averaging 282 units per period. This is a significant jump from the previous average of ~80. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0), and we are experiencing stockouts. The lead time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent successful deliveries (P13, P14 orders arrived on time). To satisfy this new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current spike. Sigma_hat is also set using N=3 to account for the high volatility observed in this spike. This configuration aims to aggressive restock to meet the new demand level and minimize lost sales, while accounting for the ~5 period cycle (lead time + current period) required to replenish inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean jumped from ~80 to ~282 (+250%) over the last 3 periods. Inventory depleted to 0 due to spike, necessitating high order volume to recover.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20, facing a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 305, 322, 219, and 194, averaging approximately 260 units per period. This is a massive increase compared to the previous regime (~80 units). Due to this spike and some lost shipments (P5, P8), on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time (L) is consistently observed at 4 periods for successful deliveries. To satisfy the high service level required by the high profit margin (q = 19/20 = 0.95), we must maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the new higher mean. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 captures the new regime (Avg ~260). The OR engine's capping mechanism will prevent over-ordering if the pipe is already full, but given the 0 on-hand status and the need to maintain supply for the next 5 periods, we set parameters to reflect the recent high-demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 16: mean increased from ~80 to ~260 (+225%) based on last 4 periods (P16-P19). Recent trend shows a slight moderation from the peak (300+ down to ~200), but remains well above historical levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted up significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has been 305, 322, 219, 194, and 235. The mean for this recent high-demand regime is 255. The inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) with back-to-back stockouts since Period 17, as arrivals are not yet matching the new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P16 order arrived at P20 conclude). To recover from stockouts and meet this sustained higher demand level (~255 units/period), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover (1+L) periods, which is (1+4)*255 = 1275 units. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the full pipeline requirement. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~80 to ~255 (+218%) based on P16-P20. Inventory depleted to 0, requiring persistent high orders to satisfy pipeline needs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3628.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observe that the order from Period 17 (272 units) arrived successfully with a lead time of 4. Current on-hand inventory is 77. The demand regime shift that began in Period 16 remains significantly higher than historical levels, with the last 6 periods (P16-P21) averaging 245 units (305, 322, 219, 194, 235, 195). Although demand has moderated slightly from the initial peak of >300, it has stabilized around the ~200-230 range. We are currently managing a large pipeline (1,208 units) consisting of orders placed in response to the stockout (P18: 448, P19: 373, P20: 364). These large shipments are expected to arrive in Periods 22, 23, and 24. Since lead time is stable at 4, L is set to 'default'. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture the high-demand regime (avg ~245). For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N with N=6 to account for the increased volatility observed during this spike. The current in-transit inventory is likely sufficient to meet target stock levels, so the OR backend will calculate a small or zero order to avoid overstocking as the surge pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: mean increased from ~80 to ~245 (+200%) based on P16-P21; demand shows signs of stabilizing around the 200-230 level after an initial peak of 300+.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4515.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P16-P22), demand has averaged 246 units per period (305, 322, 219, 194, 235, 195, 252). While there was an initial spike over 300, the last five periods (P18-P22) have stabilized slightly lower, averaging 219 units. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the entirety of this new high-demand regime, which represents the most accurate current mean for forecasting. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P16, P17, and P18. On-hand inventory has recovered to 273 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) of 905 units is significant, covering approximately 4 periods of demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the updated mean (~246) and volatility of the current regime rather than the lower historical average.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, transitioning from a low mean (~80) to a significantly higher mean (avg ~240 over the last 8 periods). Recent demand (P21-P23: 195, 252, 211) suggests a stabilization around 220 units per period. The on-hand inventory has recovered to 435 units following the arrival of large orders placed during the stockout. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, with orders from P16-P19 arriving exactly on time (excluding the confirmed losses from P5 and P8). To maintain a service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will utilize the 'recent_N' method for demand (N=8) to capture the current regime since Period 16, while keeping lead time at the default (promised) value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 16 at approximately 240 units per period (P16-P23 avg). Current inventory levels have recovered from the P17-P20 stockout.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has stabilized. For the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand is 253 units (305, 322, 219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211, 237). Despite an early peak over 300, the last 4 periods (P21-P24) have stayed in a tighter range with a mean of 223.75, suggesting a slight moderation toward a sustainable level of ~225-240. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory has recovered to 562 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 588 units in-transit. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 captures the post-shift mean of ~253 per period. Since the on-hand + in-transit (1150) currently covers roughly 4.5 periods of demand at this rate, and we need to cover L+1 (5) periods, the OR engine will determine if a modest replenishment is needed to maintain service levels without overstocking as we move past the initial stockout recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 16 at approximately 253 units per period (P16-P24 avg). Logistics reliability for orders after Period 8 is stable at L=4.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16 and has stabilized. Analyzing the post-Period 16 data (P16-P25), the mean demand is approximately 246.4 units (305, 322, 219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211, 237, 294). The most recent demand (P25) was 294, indicating that demand remains high and slightly volatile. The logistics system has stabilized with a lead time (L) of 4 periods for all orders placed after the lost shipments in P5 and P8. Current on-hand inventory is 291, and in-transit inventory is 788. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~246, the expected demand over the lead time is approximately 1230 units. The pipeline (291 + 788 = 1079) is slightly below this target, so continued ordering is necessary to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-shift demand mean and variance accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) experienced a massive regime shift starting in Period 16, with demand jumping from an average of ~80 to ~230+ units. Over the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is 243.3. However, Period 26 showed a significant dip to 113 units, which might be an outlier or the start of a slight moderation. To balance this, I will use a window of the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture the current high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent stabilization. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods for all non-lost orders. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 323 units with 966 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P23, P24, P25, and P26). The parameter choice aims to Maintain a base stock level that covers the (L+1) period demand (5 periods) focusing on the post-spike average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 16: P16-P26 average demand is approximately 243 units. Period 26 demand (113) represents a potential 50% drop compared to the post-spike average, requiring monitoring to determine if it's an outlier or a new lower regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2338.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we observe that the secondary demand regime shift suggested in Period 27 (the drop to 113) is continuing, as Period 27 demand was 145. This confirms that the high-demand period (avg ~250 during P16-P25) has ended. The current 'recent' demand (P26-P27) averages 129 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this immediate downward trend while lead time L remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (828) plus on-hand (417) is quite high relative to this new lower demand, so the OR backend will naturally reduce order quantities. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility since the P16 spike began.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: mean decreased from ~240 to ~129 (-46%) based on last 2 periods (P26-P27). This suggests the high-demand holiday or event spike has concluded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3082.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downwards following a high-demand period that occurred between P16 and P25. The last three periods (P26-P28) show demand levels of 113, 145, and 184, averaging 147 units. This is a significant drop from the ~250 unit average observed during the peak. I will set N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent deceleration. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods for all non-lost orders. With on-hand inventory at 414 and a substantial pipeline of 647, current stock is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) window (approx 147 * 5 = 735 units), especially since the system is currently in a high-inventory state (1,061 total units). The recent order of 0 in P28 was appropriate to draw down excess inventory; I will allow the backend to continue managing the replenishment based on these updated regime parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: mean decreased from ~245 to ~147 (-40%) based on last 3 periods (P26-P28), signaling the end of the high-demand seasonal or event peak.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand spike that occurred between Period 16 and Period 25 (average ~250) has clearly concluded. Demand over the last four periods (P26-P29) has averaged 143.75 (113, 145, 184, 133), representing a significant downward shift (~40%) from the previous regime. We are now in a post-peak stability phase. The logistics pipeline is reliable with a 4-period lead time for all recent non-lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory (504) plus in-transit stock (424) totals 928 units. At the current demand rate of ~144 units, this covers over 6 periods of demand. To avoid excessive holding costs while the inventory levels normalize to this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 samples (N=4) to reflect the new lower mean and variance. This will naturally signal the OR backend to reduce ordering or stop ordering until inventory levels align with the lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: post-peak mean stabilized at ~144 units (P26-P29) compared to previous ~250 peak regime. Inventory levels are currently high relative to this new demand.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has undergone a significant shift starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The last five periods (P26-P30) have seen demand levels of 113, 145, 184, 133, and 80, averaging approximately 131 units. This confirms the conclusion of the peak period. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 747 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak (P26 arrival of 323 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new lower demand mean, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the post-peak environment. The goal is to allow the OR backend to reconcile this high inventory against the reduced demand forecast, likely resulting in zero or minimal orders until the inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: post-peak demand mean stabilized at ~131 units (P26-P30) vs previous ~250. Logistics remain stable at L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $772.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The post-peak demand is significantly lower, with the last 6 periods (P26-P31) averaging approximately 122 units (113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81). Current on-hand inventory is very high (767 units) relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the confirmed lower demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. No new orders are likely necessary given the current inventory surplus, which the OR backend's capped policy will handle based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P26-P31) mean has stabilized at ~122 units, a ~50% reduction from the previous peak of ~245.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1753.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (Periods 16-25). For the post-peak period (P26-P32), the average demand is approximately 123 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently very high (641 units) relative to this new demand level, and there are no units remaining in-transit. With a lead time of 4 periods, the total pipeline needed to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods is approximately 615 units (5 * 123). Since current on-hand inventory (641) already exceeds this requirement, the backend logic will correctly minimize further orders. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this stabilized post-peak regime (P26-P32), and L is set to calculate as logistics have remained consistent at 4 periods for all successfully delivered recent orders.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P26-P32) mean has stabilized at approximately 123 units, confirming the end of the high-demand event observed earlier.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 33 is approximately 124 units (sum: 113+145+184+133+80+81+126+133 = 995 over 8 periods). This confirms the 'post-peak' regime identified in carry-over insights. Total inventory visibility includes 508 units on hand and 110 units in transit (expected from the Period 33 order), totaling 618 units. Given the target base stock is (L+1)*\u03bc, and L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (~620 units). Current inventory (618) is almost exactly aligned with this target. Logistical performance for active orders remains stable at L=4. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to reflect the stabilized post-peak demand and maintain the standard lead time of 4.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak. For the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is approximately 126.8 units per period, showing relative stability compared to the previous peak of ~245. Logistics remain stable with an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. Current 'On-hand' (362) and 'In-transit' (240, from orders in P33 and P34) total 602 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Our estimated requirement is ~635 units (127 * 5). Since 602 is slightly below this target, continued ordering is appropriate to maintain the buffer as old high-inventory stock is depleted. I'm using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this post-peak regime for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The average demand for the post-peak period (P26-P35) is 130.2 units per period. The most recent samples (P32-P35) show demands of 126, 133, 146, and 111, maintaining this stability. Logistics for recent orders appear stable at the promised lead time of L=4 (e.g., P27 order arrived in P31). Based on this, I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach aligns with the demand drop detected at Period 26 and avoids over-ordering based on the earlier massive spike. The on-hand inventory (251) and in-transit (392) are sufficient as the system transitions back to a lower demand profile.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak. Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 120 units (actual: 121.7). The current on-hand inventory is 124 units with 490 units in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods and the observed reliability of recent shipments (P22-P27 all arrived with L=4), I will use L=4. For demand parameters, I am using recent_N with N=11 to capture the post-peak stability (Period 26 to 36). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current lower demand level while the backend manages the pipeline inventory and the recent high in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P26-P36) mean remains stable at ~122 units, consistently ~50% lower than the P16-P25 peak. Logistics reliability for all delivered orders since P9 remains consistent at L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1466.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has stabilized at a significantly lower level (mean ~122) compared to the preceding peak (Period 16-25, mean ~245). Period 37 demand was 85, slightly below the post-peak average, but within expected variance. On-hand inventory is 149, with a substantial pipeline of 502 units. The 'In-transit' includes orders from P34 (130), P35 (152), P36 (98), and P37 (122), which are expected to arrive in Periods 38, 39, 40, and 41 respectively, given the confirmed stable lead time of L=4. Since the total pipeline + on-hand (651 units) significantly exceeds the projected demand for the (L+1=5) lookahead period (approx 5 * 122 = 610), the OR backend will likely minimize new orders to avoid excess holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the entire post-peak regime (P26-P37) and lead time remains at the promised/observed L=4.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). For the post-peak period (P26-P38), the average demand is approximately 123 units per period (122.9). My current inventory position (On-hand: 148, In-transit: 444) equals 592 units, which covers nearly 4.8 periods of demand at the current rate (592 / 123 \u2248 4.81). Given the lead time (L) is 4, the required coverage is (L+1) = 5 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=13, starting from Period 26) to formalize this 123-unit mean. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on this stable post-peak regime. Logistics have remained consistently at L=4 for all delivered orders since Period 9, so I will maintain the default lead time. The OR backend will maintain the pipeline inventory near the target coverage without over-ordering as the system stabilizes from the previous peak.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following the conclusion of a massive spike (Periods 16-25). For the post-peak period (P26-P39), the average demand is approximately 120 units (specifically, 1684 total units over 14 periods is 120.3). The most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) show a similar average of 113.8 units. Logistics reliability is stable at L=4 (confirmed by arrivals in P37, P38, P39). Inventory levels have normalized with on-hand at 185 and in-transit at 422 units (total 607), covering roughly 5 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use recent_N (N=14) to capture the entire stable post-peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the backend targets a base stock appropriate for the ~120 units/period demand level while maintaining the standard lead time of 4.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized in the post-peak phase that began at Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 120 units (P26-P40 mean \u2248 121.7). Recent demand (last 5 periods) is very stable, averaging 113.6 units with low variance. Inventory levels have normalized following the recovery from the earlier spike and subsequent overstock. The logistics lead time is reliably holding at 4 periods (as seen in the arrivals for P33 through P36 in the recent history). I will use a recent_N approach for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=15 to capture the entire post-peak regime since Period 26. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4, consistent with recent performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1685.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a post-peak regime since Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 41 is approximately 119 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P37-P41) show a slightly lower mean of 108 units, but given the target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 95%, we should remain anchored to the broader post-peak average to avoid understocking. Logistics reliability remains consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4 confirmed by multiple recent arrivals). Current inventory (On-hand: 196 + In-transit: 413 = 609) is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate (~120 units/period), which aligns with the (L+1) pipeline requirement. I am setting mu_hat using the last 16 samples (N=16) to capture the entire post-peak regime starting at Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Post-peak demand regime (P26-P41) mean has stabilized at ~119 units, which is a ~50% reduction from the P16-P25 peak regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following the conclusion of a significant demand spike (P16-P25). For the post-peak period (P26-P42), the average demand is approximately 119 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Current on-hand inventory is 125 units, and in-transit inventory is 432 units (orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). Logistics remain stable with a lead time (L) of 4 periods. My strategy is to maintain parameters that reflect this stable 'post-peak' regime. I will use recent_N with N=17 (covering P26 to P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately without factoring in the historical massive spike. This balances the service level against the $1 holding cost.

Logistics have been consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods for all orders placed after Period 8. Currently, the on-hand inventory (161) plus in-transit stock (451) is sufficient to cover the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), assuming a mean of ~119.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The post-peak mean (P26-P44) is approximately 119 units per period. Recent performance (last 5 periods) shows a mean of 112.8, indicating slight continued moderation. Logistics remain consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (L=4 confirmed for all recent arrivals). On-hand inventory is 151, and in-transit inventory is 429 units. Total pipeline inventory is 580. With a stabilized mean of ~119 and L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)*mean = 5*119 = 595 units. The current pipeline of 580 is slightly below the target, but given the slight downward trend in recent samples, maintaining parameters based on the stable P26+ regime is appropriate. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=19 (covering the regime from P26 to P44) to capture this stabilized average.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following the high-demand event from Period 16-25. For the last 20 periods (P26-P45), demand has averaged approximately 118.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 24.5. Current on-hand inventory is 124 units and pipeline inventory is 441 units (total 565). With a stable lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand across 5 periods (L+1). A base stock level targeting 119 units/period would be around 595 units. The current total inventory (565) is slightly below this, and the OR backend's inventory balancing will ensure the order size correctly accounts for this gap. I am using recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full stability of this post-peak regime while ignoring the previous spike. Logistics remain consistent at L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1905.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The post-peak average demand (P26-P46) is approximately 119 units, with recent performance (last 5 periods) averaging 118 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P41 arrived at P45, P42 arrived at P46). Inventory levels are currently healthy (On-hand 109 + In-transit 480), and the logistics pipeline is flowing correctly. I will use a recent_N of 21 (covering the entire post-peak period from P26 onwards) to capture the stabilized mean and variance of this current regime while excluding the massive spike period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2762.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a 'post-peak' regime since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (P26-P47), the average demand is approximately 118 units per period, consistently lower than the previous spike. Lead time remains reliable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 37-47). Currently, the inventory position (On-hand: 107, In-transit: 432, total 539) is well-aligned with the target base stock for this regime (approx 118 * 5 = 590). I will use the recent_N method with N=20 to capture the current stable regime (P28-P47) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this effectively ignores the massive spike around Period 16 and focuses on the current post-peak stability. This ensures the OR backend maintains a service level appropriate for the ~118 unit mean while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2327.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a 'post-peak' regime since Period 26, following a massive spike from Periods 16-25. Analysis of the demand from Period 26 to Period 48 shows a mean of approximately 119.5 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) maintains this stability with a mean of 122.3. Logistics remain consistently reliable with an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, verified by sequences of arrivals from Period 33 onwards. Current on-hand inventory is 67, and in-transit is 504. Given we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final ordering decision. Any order placed now would arrive in Period 53 (49+4), which is beyond the game's duration. Therefore, the parameters are set to maintain the current stable regime forecasting (using recent_N=23 for the post-peak period) even though the final order's arrival is technically out of bounds of the simulation's end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2158.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 120 units (P26-P49 average is ~121). The most recent 5 periods (P45-P49) show a consistent mean of ~126, while the 20-period average (P30-P49) is ~118. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals: P44 arrived at P48, P45 at P49). On-hand inventory is currently low (65 units), but in-transit inventory is high (515 units), which covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike stability while allowing for recent variability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the logistics network has returned to consistent 4-period delivery since the earlier disruptions.
