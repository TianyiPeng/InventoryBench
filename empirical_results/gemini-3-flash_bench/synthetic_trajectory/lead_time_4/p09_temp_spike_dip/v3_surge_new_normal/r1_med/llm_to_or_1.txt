Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no historical arrivals yet to infer lead time drifts, I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For demand estimation, we have 5 historical samples: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59. The mean of these samples is 115.4. However, the most recent sample (Period 5) is significantly lower (59), suggesting a possible downward shift or just high variance. Given the lack of more context, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the available historical distribution while staying responsive to the latest figures. The OR engine will target a service level based on the profit/holding ratio, aiming to cover demand for L+1 periods (5 periods total).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 176 units. Based on the observation from Period 1's conclusion, demand was 88 units and since on-hand inventory was 0, we had 88 units of lost sales. The 176 units are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we expect that first order to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Given we only have one demand observation (88) and historical samples provided in the prompt (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), the mean demand of the historical samples is 115.4. Including the actual Period 1 demand of 88, the mean is 110.8. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to allow the backend to incorporate the provided historical data and the new Period 1 observation (Total 6 samples). This will set the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have a pipeline of 344 units (176 from P1 + 168 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible for decision-making in P6. Consequently, for the first few periods (P1-P4), we cannot satisfy demand as we started with 0 inventory and lead time > 0. Demand for P1 was 88 and P2 was 79. My primary objective is to maintain a pipeline that covers demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since it is too early to detect a shift in demand or lead time with only two concluded periods, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize available historical samples to set the base stock level.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU is 'chips(Regular)'. Our historical demand samples are [146, 110, 112, 150, 59]. In the game history, we see realized demands of 88, 79, and 121 for Periods 1-3. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 506 units in transit (orders from P1=176, P2=168, P3=162). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected during Period 5 resolution and observable at Period 6 start), there is no evidence to suggest actual lead time differs from the promised 4. Demand shows moderate variance but no clear regime shift yet. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the backend to incorporate observations as they conclude, and use 'default' for demand and volatility to capture all available historical data (5 samples + 3 period realizations) to stabilize the base stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. Demand has been relatively consistent: Period 1: 88 (revised from 146 in prompt history to 88 in conclude), Period 2: 79, Period 3: 121, Period 4: 103. The 'Historical Demand Data' in the prompt snippet (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) contradicts the 'Game History' (88, 79, 121, 103). I will prioritize the Game History as it represents the actual resolution. Mean demand is approx 98. Since we are waiting for the first arrival (Period 1 order of 176 units) to arrive this period, I will stick to the promised lead time L=4 and use all 4 available history samples (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the pipeline covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $379.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the order from Period 1 (176 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). The first four periods had 0 sales due to no starting inventory, but Period 5 finally saw 111 units sold against a demand of 111. The current on-hand inventory is 65, with 425 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Historical demand samples are [146, 110, 112, 150, 59] according to the provided prompt data (though the concluding logs show slightly different realized demand [88, 79, 121, 103, 111]). Using the realization data, the mean demand is approx 100.4. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observation confirms L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the initial variance while the 'cap' mechanism prevents over-ordering while we have a massive pipeline relative to current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have confirmed the lead time L=4 based on deliveries from Period 1 (arrived P5) and Period 2 (arrived P6). Total demand samples (Period 1-6) are [88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130]. The average demand is 105.3, with a noticeable upward trend in recent periods (P3-P6 avg: 116.25). Currently, we have 103 units on-hand and 301 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Given L=4, my parameters cover 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher demand volatility and mean, ensuring the base stock accounts for the current demand environment while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory of 301 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $290.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have observed 3 arrivals (from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3), all confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand data shows relative stability with a slight upward trend in recent periods (Demand samples: 88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130, 111). I will use L=4 (default) as it is well-supported. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (averaging ~115) provide a better reflection of current volume than the full sample set, which includes early lower numbers. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use recent_N=5 to align with the current demand regime. With an on-hand inventory of 154 and in-transit units (from P4, P6, P7) totaling 275, the pipeline is reasonably healthy, though we must maintain orders to cover the (L+1)=5 period lead time window.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Current inventory status for 'chips(Regular)' shows 148 units on-hand and 313 units in-transit. Historical demand over 8 periods (88, 79, 121, 103, 111, 130, 111, 101) shows a mean of approximately 105.5 units per period. The recent demand (last 3 periods: 130, 111, 101) suggests a slight stabilization near the average. Setting L to 'default' (4 periods) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the full recent baseline, as there are no strong signals of a regime shift or seasonality yet. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for consistency with the demand window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). There was no arrival in Period 9 because no order was placed in Period 5. The current on-hand inventory is 92 units, with 411 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Recent demand has shown a slight downward shift, with the last period (P9) recording a demand of 56, compared to an earlier average around 100-110. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand forecasting to capture this recent cooling while maintaining enough buffer for the typical lead time cycle (L=4). Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed 4-period history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. The demand for Period 10 was 156, which depleted our inventory to 0. Historical demand is averaging around 107 units per period (sample mean: 107, std: 28). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated in Periods 5-8 and 10). There is a concern regarding the Period 5 order (0 units ordered) and the fact that we have 0 on-hand inventory. Our pipeline inventory is 426 units (orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, 10). The OR backend uses L to calculate the safety stock and base stock levels for a (L+1) horizon. Given the recent demand spike in P10 (156) and the inventory stockout, I will use recent history (N=5) to slightly weight the recent demand higher, as the 10-period average is slightly lower. Using L=4, mu_hat over 5 periods (~545 for L+1=5), and sigma_hat (~70 for L+1=5) to ensure sufficient coverage while navigating the current stockout.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 27 units. The pipeline (in-transit) is 462 units. History shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, and P11). Note that the order from Period 5 was 0 units, which explains why Period 9 showed 0 units arrived. Demand has been relatively stable, though it fluctuated slightly recently (P10: 156, P11: 109). Historical demand averages approximately 108 units per period based on all available samples (P1-P11). To maintain a proper base stock for a lead time of 4, we need coverage for 5 periods (L+1). L=4 is well-established. For mu_hat, using the mean of all 11 samples (~108) seems appropriate as there is no clear regime shift, resulting in 5 * 108 = 540. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation over the same period to capture volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistent based on concluded arrivals (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, and P8 all arrived in exactly 4 periods). Order from P5 was 0, so no arrival was expected for that slot in P9. The demand shows a shift: periods 1-8 averaged ~106 units, but P10 saw a spike to 156 (causing a stockout), and P12-P13 continue to show demand around 103-109. However, the early 'samples' provided in the prompt (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) differ from the actual history (88, 79, 121, 103, 111). Using the actual game history, the mean demand is roughly 106. Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will set L to 4. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the stockout event in P10, ensuring the base stock level is sufficiently high to cover the replenishment cycle (L+1=5 periods). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the higher variance observed recently.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' at Period 14 of 50. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The only anomaly was Period 9 where no arrival occurred, but that was because no order was placed in Period 5. Demand has stabilized after an initial period of stockouts. The last 13 periods show a mean demand of approximately 107.5 units. Specifically, looking at the last 5 samples (Periods 9-13), the mean is 103.2 and the standard deviation is approximately 36. This relatively stable demand suggests using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to balance reactiveness and stability. L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4. Current on-hand is 63, and in-transit is 437. With L=4, the base stock targets coverage for 5 periods (L+1).

Daily Profit: $388.00, Daily Holding Cost: $25.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the conclusion messages (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14). Demand in the initial 4 periods (Mean=97.75) changed starting Period 5. From Period 5 to 14, the mean demand is 111 units per period. Examining the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14), the demand has been 156, 109, 103, 92, and 97 (Mean=111.4). There is no strong evidence of a new regime shift or seasonality as the product name 'chips(Regular)' doesn't suggest specific timing spikes and the current sequence is relatively stable around the 110 mark. Therefore, I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-startup behavior. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods). Current on-hand (25) plus in-transit (463) covers approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the current rate, which is slightly above the L+1 requirement, but the OR backend will adjust the order based on the critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized starting Period 5; mean demand for P5-P14 is 111 units/period compared to initial P1-P4 mean of 98 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system state shows an on-hand inventory of 69 and a pipeline inventory of 385. The historical data confirms a steady lead time of 4 periods (as noted in the carry-over insights). Demand has been relatively stable since Period 5. Calculating the mean demand from Period 5 to Period 15 (11 samples), we find an average of 108.55 units per period, which is consistent with the previous insight of ~111. I will use a recent_N approach (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime while excluding the initial startup periods. This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers (L+1) periods (in this case 5 periods), is based on the most relevant demand data. The OR backend will then calculate the order by subtracting the pipeline (385) from the target base stock, subject to the safety cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $716.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand surged significantly to 263 units, compared to the established mean of 111. This represents a potential demand regime shift or a significant outlier. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit inventory is 412 units. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders (P1-P4 and P6-P12). Given the recent demand spike, I need to adjust the forecast to account for higher volatility and a possible new mean. I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent surge and stabilize the stock levels, while keeping the lead time at its proven value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected at Period 16: demand reached 263 units, more than double the previous 10-period average of 111.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18. Demand has undergone a massive surge starting at Period 16 (263 units) and continuing in Period 17 (223 units), likely due to a seasonal or event-driven factor for chips. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 111. The inventory is currently stock-out (0 on-hand) due to this unexpected surge. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of previous orders. To address the new demand regime, I am using the last 2 periods of data (Period 16 and 17) to estimate the new mean (avg = 243). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * 243 = 5 * 243 = 1215 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this higher volume. I am also increasing sigma_hat using an explicit value of 200 (based on the step change in volatility) to provide a higher safety buffer, as the OR backend's default standard deviation will be skewed by the much lower historical demand. This aggressive stance aims to recover from the stock-out and meet the new demand level despite the 4-period lead time delay.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Periods 16-17 show a high-demand regime with an average of 243 units/period, compared to the previous average of 111 units (+119% increase).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift starting at Period 16. The demand for Periods 16-18 was 263, 223, and 245 units respectively (average ~244), compared to the previous average of 111. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 878 units. The promised lead time is 4, and consistent arrivals confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since the demand has sustained this high level for 3 periods, I am setting N=3 for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new surge. This will set a higher base stock to recover from the stockouts seen in Periods 16-18. L is set to default as the lead time of 4 is consistent.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~244 units) sustained for 3 periods (P16-P18), confirming the surge reported in Period 18 and a clean break from the previous Period 5-15 mean of 111.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 263, 223, 245, and 218, averaging approximately 237 units per period. This is a significant shift from the previous average of ~111. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to this surge exceeding previous supply plans. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., Period 15 order arrived in Period 19). For Period 20, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new regime. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4. Since (1+L) = 5, the base stock targeting 5 periods of supply will be calculated by the backend using these recent statistics.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~237 units) sustained for 4 periods (P16-P19), confirmed via consistent demand levels significantly above the historical mean.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) has been 263, 223, 245, 218, and 247, respectively, resulting in an average of 239.2 units per period. This is a significant shift from the previous average of ~111. Despite consistent arrivals with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, on-hand inventory is currently 0 because historical orders (placed during the low-demand regime) are insufficient to meet the new demand levels. To address this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, so 'default' is appropriate. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the $4 profit versus $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~239 units) sustained for 5 periods (P16-P20); previous regime (P5-P15) mean was 111 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand in Period 21 was 324, the highest observed yet, following a sustained period of high demand (P16-P20 average: 239). The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 253.3 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has consistently exceeded arrivals from the previous low-demand regime orders. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat targets this new regime effectively while capturing the recent spike to 324. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock that attempts to satisfy this higher demand level while balancing the profit ($4.0) vs. holding cost ($1.0) ratio.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P21) sustained for 6 periods with mean demand of 253 units, significantly higher than the previous 111 unit average; Period 21 reached a new peak of 324 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the large order of 391 units from Period 18 arrived, finally satisfying demand and leaving 152 units on-hand. The high-demand regime is firmly established (P16-P22 average is ~251 units). The most recent lead time observation (P18 order arriving P22) maintains the lead time at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently full with 901 units in-transit. For Period 23, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the high-demand regime (last 7 periods, N=7) to ensure the base stock calculation accurately reflects the increased demand level of ~251 units/period while accounting for the significant volatility observed (range 218-324). L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P22) mean is 251 units/period (stdev ~38), representing a sustained +126% increase over the P5-P15 mean of 111.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is firmly established, starting at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 8 periods (P16-P23), the mean demand is 250.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 32.7. The historical carry-over insights confirm this shift. We have a significant amount in-transit (895 units), which reflects the larger orders placed during this surge to catch up with demand. The actual lead time remains steady at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) will capture the current mean (~251) across the 1+L (5) period window, while sigma_hat (N=8) will provide a standard deviation based on this regime's volatility (~33). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current high demand while the OR backend's cap prevents massive over-ordering if demand fluctuations occur.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P23) mean demand updated to 251 units/period (N=8, stdev ~33); lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $874.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 250.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 31.4. The previous regime (P5-P15) averaged only 111 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on multiple historical arrivals (P1 order arrived P5, P20 order arrived P24). Consequently, I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period lead time. For demand parameters, I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 (covering the entire high-demand regime P16-P24) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained demand level of ~250 units rather than the historical average, which would lead to stockouts. Currently, we have 102 on-hand and 971 in transit, but with a 4-period lead time, we must maintain a pipeline that covers demand until the P25 order arrives in P29.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P24) mean demand is 250 units/period (N=9, stdev ~31), confirming a permanent shift from the earlier 111 units/period average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $976.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime pattern since Period 16. In Period 25, demand was 263 units, consistent with the high-demand regime identified in carry-over insights. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 251.4 units. Although inventory dropped to 0 at the end of Period 25 due to a stockout (demand 263 > supply 244), the large in-transit pipeline of 1065 units is expected to resolve this as large orders from P22 onwards arrive. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to accurately reflect this specific high-demand regime (P16-P25), which ensures the base stock calculation captures the current mean (~251) and elevated volatility without being diluted by the lower historical data (Periods 1-15).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P25) mean demand is 251 units/period (N=10, stdev ~31), maintaining the ~125% increase over the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand dropped significantly to 119 units, which is a departure from the high-demand regime (avg ~250) observed from P16-P25. However, this is a single data point and may be an outlier or the start of a new regime rather than a return to the P5-P15 mean of 111. I will continue to use N=11 for mu_hat (P16-P26) to incorporate this shift while maintaining stability, resulting in a mean of ~239. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P22 order in P26. On-hand inventory is 198, and there is a large pipeline (996 units) that should satisfy upcoming demand assuming the high-demand regime continues or moderates slightly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $206.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we observe that demand in Periods 26 and 27 (119 and 135 units respectively) has dropped significantly from the 'high-demand regime' (avg ~250 units) seen between Periods 16-25. This suggests a potential return to the earlier baseline (avg ~111) or a new lower regime. However, since we only have two data points for this drop, I am transitioning the forecast using a shorter window (N=3) to be responsive while acknowledging the high demand just before. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 334 and in-transit is 820. Given the lower recent demand, the pipeline is likely sufficient to cover near-term needs, but we must adjust mu_hat to prevent excessive over-ordering if this lower demand persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is entering a new demand regime since Period 26. After a high-demand phase (avg ~250) from P16-P25, demand has dropped significantly to an average of 121 units over the last three periods (P26: 119, P27: 135, P28: 110). This indicates a post-surge stabilization or a new seasonal pattern. Current inventory is high: on-hand is 465 and in-transit is 579. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining service levels, I am adjusting the demand forecast to reflect this recent lower-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this new behavior while monitoring if this drop is sustained.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 26: mean demand decreased from ~250 units to ~121 units (-52%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-61.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a lower regime starting at Period 26. The previous high-demand regime (P16-P25) averaged ~250 units, but the last four periods (P26-P29) have returned to an average of 123 units (119, 135, 110, 128). This matches the volume of the earlier stable regime (P5-P15 avg: 111). Currently, 'On-hand' inventory (573) plus 'In-transit' (343) equals 916 units, which is very high relative to the new demand level (approx 7.4 periods of stock). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory position is significantly above the required base stock for this lower demand regime, the OR backend logic will naturally suppress ordering, but providing accurate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 parameters based on the most recent 4-period regime (N=4) ensures the backend calculates a realistic target for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~250 to 123 units (-50.8%) over the last 4 periods (P26-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26, approximately 5 periods ago. The mean demand for this recent period (P26-P30) is 127.2 units (119, 135, 110, 128, 144). The high-demand regime (P16-P25) which averaged ~250 units is clearly over. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P22-P26 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 677 units, and in-transit is 95 units (total pipeline = 772). Given the new demand level, this is excessive inventory, so the priority is to stop ordering until inventory depletes. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent lower demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 5 periods: mean decreased from ~250 to 127 units (-49%).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting at Period 26, following a high-demand peak (P16-P25). The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is approximately 119.17 units (119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79). Current on-hand inventory is 693 units, and there are no units in-transit. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) at the current mean demand would be roughly 5 * 119 = 595 units. Since our on-hand inventory (693) already exceeds this coverage, and we have zero units in-transit, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (N=6) to ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation aligns with current reality, preventing unnecessary ordering while inventory slowly depletes through demand resolution.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 6 periods: mean decreased from ~250 to 119.17 units (-52%).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 26 is now firmly established over the last 7 periods (P26-P32). The mean demand during this current lower-demand phase is approximately 120.14 units, a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime of ~250 units. The most recent demand sample was 126 units (P32). On-hand inventory is currently very high (567 units) with zero units in-transit, as previous orders from the high-demand period (P22-P25) and the transition period (P26-P27) have arrived. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the new lower mean of approximately 600 units across the 5-period window (1+L=5). Sigma_hat is also adjusted to reflect recent volatility. Given the high on-hand volume relative to the new demand level, the OR backend will likely result in an order of 0 to bleed off excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 7 periods (P26-P32): mean demand decreased from ~250 to 120.14 units (-52%).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 26. The mean demand for the 8 periods in this current regime (P26-P33) is approximately 118 units/period (119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, 126, 103). The current inventory position is high: On-hand = 464, In-transit = 74, Total = 538. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, my base stock needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. With a target mean of ~118, the target base stock is approximately 5 * 118 = 590 units. Our current inventory (538) is close to this target, having successfully drawn down the surplus from the previous high-demand period (P16-P25). I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this most recent stable regime. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 8 periods (P26-P33): mean demand decreased from ~250 to 118 units (-52.8%).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting at Period 26. Over the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the mean demand is approximately 115.7 units (119, 135, 110, 128, 144, 79, 126, 103, 98), which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~250 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P27 order arrived at P31). Currently, on-hand inventory is 366 units with 165 units in-transit (orders from P33 and P34). The sum of inventory and in-transit (531) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate (~116 units/period). I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime accurately and set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is well-established.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 9 periods (P26-P34): mean demand decreased to 115.7 units (-54% from previous regime).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26. Since then (P26-P35), demand has averaged 117.3 units per period (N=10), representing a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime of ~250 units. The most recent demand (P35) was 131 units, which is consistent with this lower regime. On-hand inventory is 235 units and in-transit is 252 units (orders from P33, P34, P35, plus residual). Note that zero units arrived in P32-P35 because no orders were placed in P28-P31 due to excess inventory. Arrivals are expected to resume in P37 (the P33 order). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower demand regime (P26-P35) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 10 periods (P26-P35): mean demand decreased to 117.3 units (stdev ~20), a ~53% decrease from the P16-P25 regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 26. While the Period 16-25 average was approximately 250 units, the demand since Period 26 has stabilized at a much lower mean of approximately 118 units (N=11, stdev ~20). The inventory levels were initially very high due to orders placed during the high-demand period, but are now normalizing. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime has been sustained for 11 periods (P26-P36), I am using N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For L, I use calculate to maintain the 4-period lead time logic. The target is to maintain enough stock to cover L+1 (5) periods of demand at the current rate (~590 units total exposure), considering our current pipeline of 389 units and on-hand of 106.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 26. For the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the mean demand is 121.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. This represents a sustained return to a lower demand profile compared to the P16-P25 surge. Inventory levels are currently being managed down from a excess created by the prior surge; on-hand inventory is 36 and in-transit is 448. The most recent order arrival (Period 37) confirms lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=12 to capture this current stable regime while ignoring the previous high-demand spike. Lead time L is set to calculate to reflect the stable observed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a new lower-demand regime since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent 13 periods (P26-P38), the mean demand is approximately 121.5 units per period. In the most recent 3 periods (P36-P38), demand has been 129, 144, and 109, averaging 127.3, confirming the stability of this regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37 and the Period 34 order in Period 38. With On-hand inventory at 18 and In-transit inventory at 510 (covering orders from periods 35, 36, 37, and 38), the system needs to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the statistics of the current 121-unit regime while ignoring the previous high-demand spike. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates, preventing over-ordering while maintaining the target service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 119 units per period (P26-P39). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 529 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (P33-P35 arrived in P37-P39 respectively, all with lead_time=4). I will set L to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the entire current regime from Period 26 to Period 39) to anchor the OR backend to the most recent demand behavior and avoid the high-demand volatility from the P16-P25 regime. This will result in a base stock targeting ~5 periods of demand (L+1), which is approximately 600 units. Given the pipeline inventory of 529, the backend should place a small but sufficient order to maintain service levels without overstocking as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 14 periods (P26-P39): mean demand is approximately 119 units/period, down from ~250 units in the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in the current regime (starting Period 26), with an average demand of approximately 119 units per period over the last 15 periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 39 and 40 resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), the priority is ensuring sufficient stock to cover the review plus lead time period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current in-transit inventory is 492 units, which is slightly below the expected requirement for the next 5 periods (approx 120 * 5 = 600 units) given the current zero on-hand balance. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the mean of the current regime accurately, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to reflect current volatility. Lead time 'L' will remain at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 is sustained for 15 periods (P26-P40) with a mean demand of ~121 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, with a mean of approximately 121 units and a standard deviation of about 20. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since Period 41 ended with 9 units on-hand and 508 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41), the pipeline is currently very full relative to the expected demand of ~121/period. Specifically, the pipeline inventory of 508 units plus 9 on-hand (517 total) covers more than 4 periods of demand at the current rate (121 * 4 = 484). However, the OR backend's base-stock calculation and capped policy will automatically adjust the order downwards (likely to 0 or a very small amount) because the lead-time demand (L+1=5 periods) is roughly 605 units, and we have 517 already. I will set L to 4 (promised/actual), mu_hat to 121 * 5 = 605 using recent_N (N=16, from P26 to P41), and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~121 units/period since Period 26. Looking at the last 17 periods (P26-P42), the mean demand is approximately 121.7 units with a standard deviation of about 18.7. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P33 to P38 all showing a 4-period duration. On-hand inventory is low (19 units), while in-transit inventory is high (479 units), largely due to consistent ordering in the last few periods (P39-P42 orders total 479). I will use a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the current stable regime (N=17) to ensure the OR backend captures the current demand frequency and volatility without noise from the high-demand peak (P16-P25).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a new regime since Period 26, following a significant decline from the high-demand period observed between Periods 16-25. For the last 18 periods (P26-P43), the mean demand is approximately 119.5 units per period with a standard deviation of about 20. Lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals (P33-P39 orders) arriving exactly 4 periods later. Currently, we have 17 units on-hand and 523 units in-transit (orders from P40-P43). The backend OR engine needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=18 captures the current stable regime most accurately while discarding the irrelevant high-volatility data from the previous surge.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 has remained stable for 19 periods (P26-P44) with an average demand of approximately 123.5 units per period. The recent N=19 mean is 2348 / 19 \u2248 123.58, and the standard deviation over this period is approximately 19.3. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to a slight demand spike in Period 44 (147 units). Total in-transit inventory is 526 units, which roughly covers 4 periods of demand at the current average rate. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory position, it is appropriate to use 'recent_N' for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=19 to align with the current regime length. The lead time (L) remains consistently at the promised 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals.

=== Period 45 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $481.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 has remained stable for 20 periods (P26-P45). Calculating the mean and standard deviation for this period (N=20) yields a mean demand of approximately 122.9 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P41-P45). Setting L to 4, mu_hat to (1+L)*mean (~615), and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)*sigma (~43). Using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures this specific stability, ignoring the earlier high-demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 has reached 20 periods of stability (P26-P45) with a mean of 122.9 units/period and stdev of 19.3.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 26. Over the last 21 periods (P26-P46), the mean demand is approximately 123.8 units with a standard deviation of 19.4. No seasonal shifts or date-related drivers are apparent in the data provided. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P45 and P46 from orders placed in P41 and P42). I will continue using the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable regime, and the calculate method for L to account for the consistently observed 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), but there is a healthy pipeline of 503 units to cover demand over the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of a 50-period game. The current demand regime, established at Period 26, has been stable for 22 periods (P26-P47) with a mean demand of approximately 123 units per period and a standard deviation of about 19. Inventory on-hand is 38 units, and in-transit inventory is 502 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which means an order placed now (P48) will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 52. Since the game concludes at the end of Period 50, any order placed in Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the final reward. The pipeline inventory already includes orders from Periods 44, 45, 46, and 47 (totaling 103 + 125 + 125 + 149 = 502 units), which will arrive in Periods 48, 49, 50, and 51 respectively. Given that we only have 3 periods of demand remaining (P48, P49, P50) and nearly 400 units arriving before the game ends, we are already significantly overstocked. My objective moves to minimizing further holding costs while maintaining the stable demand parameters for the OR backend's calculation, though the resulting order will likely be zero due to the large pipeline and short remaining horizon.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26. For the last 23 periods (P26-P48), the mean demand is approximately 123 units with a standard deviation of about 19. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (P37-P48 confirm lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is 28 units, and in-transit inventory is 511 units (orders from P45, P46, P47, P48), which covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Given that we are at Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (L=4) would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game horizon. However, since the objective is to optimize the base stock policy within the parameters provided, I will use recent_N=23 to reflect the current stable regime (P26-P48). I'll use L=4 (promised) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 23 periods to ensure the OR backend has the most accurate recent statistics.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent 24 periods (P26-P49), the mean demand is approximately 122.3 units/period with a standard deviation of 17.6. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., P45 order arrived at P49). Currently, on-hand inventory is 20 units and in-transit inventory is 497 units. Given the lead time is 4, we must account for demand over 5 periods (Review + Lead Time). I will set \u03bc\u0302 to reflect this recent stable mean (122.3 * 5 \u2248 612) and \u03c3\u0302 based on recent volatility. Using 'recent_N' for both demand and lead-time allows the OR backend to utilize the established stability of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 has maintained stability for 24 periods (P26-P49) with a mean of 122.3 units/period and stdev of 17.6.
