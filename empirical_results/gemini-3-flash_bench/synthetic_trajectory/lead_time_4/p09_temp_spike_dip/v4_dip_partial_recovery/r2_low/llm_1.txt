With the game ending at Period 50, the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50, making this the last useful ordering period. The pipeline is as follows: Period 47 arrival (P42 order: 80), Period 48 arrival (P43 order: 80), Period 49 arrival (P44 order: 130), and Period 50 arrival (P45 order: 40). Existing inventory is 82. Total inventory available to cover periods 46-49 (4 periods) is On-hand (82) + Arrivals in P47-P49 (80+80+130) = 372. Expected total demand for these 4 periods is ~320 units (80 * 4). This leaves ~52 units for Period 50. To cover Period 50's demand and ensure no stockouts, I need roughly 80 units total for that period. Current projected arrival for Period 50 is 40 units. Therefore, an order of 40 units in Period 46 will bring the total available for Period 50 up to approximately 92 units (52 carryover + 40 new arrival), which is sufficient. I will not order more to minimize final holding costs since unsold inventory reflects poorly on total reward.",

Since demand resolution occurs after arrivals, and the game concludes with Period 50, any order placed now or hereafter will not arrive in time to satisfy demand within the game's duration.

Recent demand has fluctuated, with a spike to 143 in Period 48, but averaging around 80 in the current regime. While we might face a stockout in Period 50 if Period 49 and 50 demands are high, an order placed now cannot resolve that.

Our objective is to maximize total reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory). (a) Product: Chips (Regular) is a snack item with generally stable demand. (b) Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been around 70-80 units, with an outlier spike of 143 in Period 48. However, the high-demand regime established around Period 26 holds steady at an average of roughly 75-85 units per period. (c) Lead Time: Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Any order placed now in Period 50 will arrive at the end of Period 54 (after Demand Resolution), meaning it cannot be sold within the 50-period horizon. (d) Inventory assessment: We have 63 units on-hand and 40 units in-transit (ordered in Period 46, arriving during Period 50). Since Period 50 is the last period, our goal is to satisfy Period 50 demand while minimizing ending inventory. (e) Final Order Logic: Because the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed today will only arrive well after the game has ended. These units would only incur holding costs or contribute to ending inventory without the possibility of being sold. Therefore, the optimal action to maximize profit and minimize holding costs at the end of the simulation is to order 0 units.",
