Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand ranging from 65 to 136, with an average of approximately 95.6 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since my current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must place an order immediately to cover the pipeline. Following the logic of ordering to cover (L+1) periods (4+1=5 periods) to ensure stock-out prevention while arrivals are pending, I need to account for approximately 5 periods of demand. Using the historical average of ~96 units, the total target pipeline is 480 units. I will order 480 units now to establish the initial inventory pipeline, as these units will not arrive until Period 5 (assuming lead time holds).",

Period 1 actual demand was 85 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods.

The Period 1 order covers approximately 4.8 periods of demand once it arrives. e) Order Logic: To maintain a continuous pipeline and account for the 4-period lead time, I need to place an order now that will arrive in Period 6 (after the Period 1 order). Targeting a 5-period cycle (L+1), I calculate required coverage. Estimated demand is ~100/period. Coverage needed for Period 6: 100 units. Since 480 units are already in transit to cover the gap starting at Period 6 for about 4-5 periods, I will place a smaller supplemental order to ensure no stockout once that batch begins to deplete.",

Since current on-hand is 0 and I have zero sales due to stockouts, the goal is to cover the lead time + 1 period (5 periods total). Estimated demand for 5 periods @ 110 units/period = 550. My current in-transit (580) already covers this horizon. However, I am currently stocked out and will remain so until the P1 order arrives. Adding more orders now won't solve the immediate stockout but might increase holding costs excessively once the large P1 shipment arrives. I will place a small order to maintain the pipeline for the 5th period out, but since in-transit is already high relative to early demand, I will observe before committing more capital.",

To maximize profit and end with minimal inventory, the final orders must be carefully managed. Current on-hand is 51. In-transit arrivals remaining: P45 (concludes at P46) = 80 units (P41 order), P46 (concludes at P47) = 80 units (P42 order), P47 (concludes at P48) = 70 units (P43 order), P48 (concludes at P49) = 40 units (P44 order). Total pipeline including on-hand is 321 units. With 6 periods of demand remaining (P45-P50) and an estimated mean of ~80 units, total needed is ~480 units. I need to order the difference to ensure service through P50 while avoiding excessive holding costs at $1/unit. I will order 80 units this period to continue filling the pipeline toward the end-game target.",

Recent periods show some volatility (e.g., 137 in P44, 94 in P45), but the 5-period moving average is approximately 84. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), I need to ensure demand is covered through P50. Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in P50. Orders placed after P46 (P47-P50) will arrive after the game ends. Therefore, my total inventory needs to satisfy demand for P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50. Total demand for 5 periods @ 85 units/period = 425 units. Current On-hand is 37. Current In-transit is 270 (consisting of orders from P42-P45: 80, 70, 40, 80). Total pipeline = 37 + 270 = 307. To reach 425 units, I need to order 118 units. However, holding costs are high ($1.0), equal to profit ($1.0). Over-ordering is as costly as stockouts. I will order 100 units to bridge the gap and ensure coverage for the final periods while slightly hedging against a potential demand dip to minimize holding risk at the game's end.",

The game ends at Period 50. Orders placed now (Period 47) with a lead time of 4 periods will arrive during Period 51 arrival resolution, which is after the final demand resolution of the game (Period 50). Therefore, any order placed in Period 47 or later will not contribute to units sold but will potentially incur holding costs if they were to arrive earlier or if the system evaluates final inventory. My primary goal is to satisfy demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 using only the current on-hand inventory (78) and the existing in-transit pipeline (290 units). The pipeline consists of orders from P43 (70), P44 (40), P45 (80), and P46 (100). These are scheduled to arrive in P47, P48, P49, and P50 respectively. Total expected availability is 78 (on-hand) + 290 (in-transit) = 368 units. Expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50) at a mean of ~80 units is 320 units.

Therefore, any order placed now or in the remaining periods will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or generate profit. My objective is to maximize total reward (Profit * units_sold - HoldingCost * ending_inventory). Since no further arrivals are possible, I must rely on the existing inventory (On-hand: 66, plus arrivals in P48, P49, and P50) to satisfy demand. The pipeline consists of: P44 order (40 units) arriving in P48, P45 order (80 units) arriving in P49, and P46 order (100 units) arriving in P50. Total inventory available through the end of the game is 66 + 40 + 80 + 100 = 286 units. Given the recent demand regime (averaging ~80 units), we have sufficient stock to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand. Placing a new order would only incur potential systemic complexity without any benefit. Thus, the optimal action is to order 0.",
