Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no 'conclude' messages yet, we must assume the promised lead time holds (total coverage needed is L+1=5 periods). Looking at the initial demand samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136), the mean is approximately 95.6. The trend seems to be increasing significantly in the last two periods (106, 136). Using a default 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand statistics will capture this initial variance and mean. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level q = 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock will target the mean demand. Given 'In-transit' and 'On-hand' are both 0, the backend will place an order to cover the (L+1) period window.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 140 units, but because the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is currently in-transit and not yet arrived. The starting inventory was 0, and with a demand of 85, all 85 units were lost sales. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 140. I must set parameters based on the current 5-period demand history provided (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). The mean demand is approximately 95.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 27.2. Using the promised lead time L=4, the base stock objective covers L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full available history effectively while maintaining the default promised lead time until actual lead times are observed in later periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (140 units) and P2 (140 units) are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until P5 and P6 respectively based on L=4. This explains why on-hand remains 0 and sales are currently 0 (stockout). Demand in P1 (85) and P2 (129) shows an upward trend compared to the initial 5 historical samples. The average of the 5 historical samples was (82+89+65+106+136)/5 = 95.6. However, the last two concluded periods (85, 129) and the last three historical samples (65, 106, 136) suggest increasing volatility and volume. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand trend (136, 85, 129 + the context of P4/P5 if they were visible, but here I only have the 5 historical + 2 concluded). Average of last 5 available data points (P3hist: 65, P4hist: 106, P5hist: 136, P1concl: 85, P2concl: 129) is 104.2. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I'll set L to default (4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from promised.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4 periods after Period 1) and will first be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Therefore, zero arrivals up to Period 3 (reported at start of Period 4) is perfectly consistent with a lead time of 4. Demand history shows a steady increase: 85, 129, 132 (and 82, 89, 65, 106, 136 in the seeding data). The last three actual periods (85, 129, 132) suggest a higher demand regime than the initial seed data. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent upward trend and higher variance, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5 (z=0), aiming to cover average demand over the risk horizon (L+1 = 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (140 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. However, we only see confirmation of this in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which will be available at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 0 sales due to no arrivals yet, leading to significant lost sales (demands of 85, 129, 132, 108 in P1-P4). Historical demand data provided (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) suggests an increasing trend, with the recent sample (136) and game history demands (avg ~113) indicating we need to stock up. Since arrivals haven't concluded yet, I will use lead time L=4. For demand forecasting, the average of the 5 provided samples is 95.6, while the game history demand average is 113.5. Given the clear upward trend (P5 demand 136), I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the higher volume and ensure the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is sufficient. Sigma_hat remains default to handle standard volatility.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Looking at the history, the promised lead time is 4. The order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand has shown an upward trend: Period 1: 85 (though historical data said 82), Period 2: 129, Period 3: 132, Period 4: 108, Period 5: 128. The 'historical demand data' provided in the prompt (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) is slightly different from the 'game history' demand. I will prioritize the 'game history' demand as it represents the actual realization. Average demand over the 5 periods is approx 116.4. Current on-hand is low (12), but we have a large pipeline in-transit (450 units from Periods 2, 3, 4, 5). Since L=4, the pipeline should cover the next 4 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for demand mean and sigma to capture the recent level which is higher than the initial historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory situation is critical: we have 51 units on hand and 430 units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown an upward trend compared to the initial 5 samples (avg 95.6), with the last 6 periods averaging 113.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2). I will set L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time. For demand forecasting, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the higher average demand observed during the first 6 periods of the game (85, 129, 132, 108, 128, 101), which is significantly higher than the pre-game samples. This results in a mu_hat covering L+1=5 periods. Sigma_hat will also be based on recent_N=6 to reflect the actual observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 114 units/period over the first 6 periods, which is ~20% higher than initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Analysis of concluded periods reveals that orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived in P5, P6, and P7 respectively, confirming a stable actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 94 units with 365 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Historical demand since simulation start (P1-P7) shows a mean of 113.4, which is consistently higher than the initial samples (avg ~95.6). To capture this higher demand regime while smoothing volatility, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering all observed game history). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers 5 periods (L+1) of the current higher demand level (~567 units) minus the healthy pipeline of 365 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Looking at the history, orders placed in Periods 1-4 have all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand environment shifted after the initial samples; the mean demand across the first 8 periods is approximately 116 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P5-P8) show a mean of 118.5, confirming the ~114-116 level identified in the carry-over insight. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this post-initial-sample demand level for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the last 8 periods represent the current stable regime better than the original provided samples. On-hand is 103 and in-transit is 331, totaling 434 units. With a 5-period demand expectation of ~580 units, the system will place an order to cover the gap.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as seen in Period 5-9 concludes), matching the promised lead time. Demand across the first 9 periods averages approximately 112 units/period, with a slight dip in Period 9 (77 units). The current on-hand inventory is 39, and there are 463 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). Since the lead time L=4 is stable, the OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The most recent demand regime (Periods 1-9) shows a mean of 111.7. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 captures the current regime's average and volatility. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.50, which the OR backend will target via the base stock calculation.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are looking at 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 10 concluded periods. The promised lead time is 4, and the actual lead time observed (from Period 1 orders arriving in Period 5, up to Period 6 orders arriving in Period 10) is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 87 units, and 400 units are in-transit (orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, 10). Demand has been somewhat volatile: initial samples (P1-P5) averaged 96.6, then stabilized around ~114 (P1-P6), but the most recent two periods (P9-P10) show a significant dip (77 and 72). This dip might be a short-term fluctuation or a new regime. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent downward trend (Average P6-P10 = 99) while respecting the historical context. For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' as it matches the observed 4 periods. Setting sigma to 'recent_N' (N=10) provides a balanced view of volatility across the full game history.

The recent demand history (Periods 9-11: 77, 72, 99) shows a slight cooling compared to the earlier regime (avg ~114). The average of the last 11 periods is approximately 104 units. Lead times have been consistently stable at 4 periods (as shown by concluding orders from P1 through P7). My current on-hand inventory is 77, and I have 319 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since the promised lead time L=4 is reliable, the base stock should cover L+1 = 5 periods. With a target average demand estimate of ~100 units/period, the pipeline needs to be around 500 units. Currently, on-hand + in-transit is 396 units, suggesting the backend will place an order of roughly 104 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to balance the initial high burst with more recent lower demand, and 'calculate' for lead time since performance is stable.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Analysis of the the concluded periods (P5 to P12) shows a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows a regime shift: initially (P1-P8), demand averaged approximately 114 units, but over the last four periods (P9-P12), demand has dropped significantly to an average of 79 units (77, 72, 99, 68). This represents a ~30% decrease. To prevent excessive inventory buildup (holding cost $1.0 vs profit $1.0, implying a target service level of 50% for base stock), I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower demand regime. The on-hand inventory is 118 and in-transit is 349 (orders from P9, P10, P11, P12), which is quite high compared to the new lower demand level, so the OR backend should naturally scale back ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~114 to ~79 units/period (-30%) sustained over 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-95.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the delivery logic is consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods (P9 order arrived in P13). The demand regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 13) is sustained: the average demand from Period 9 to 13 is approximately 80 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84), confirming the downward shift from the previous average of ~114. On-hand inventory is 179, and in-transit is 204 (orders from P10-P13). Given Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. With L=4, the horizon is 5 periods. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (mean ~80, horizon ~400). This helps the OR backend adjust to the current lower sales volume and high existing inventory to minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The demand history shows a shift around Period 9. Demand from Period 9 to 14 averaged 85 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84, 111), which is significantly lower than the ~114 units seen in the prior regime. Although Period 14 saw a slight uptick to 111, the overall trend since Period 9 justifies using a recent average to forecast. Based on L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the last 6 periods (N=6) captures this lower demand regime. On-hand (125) and In-transit (164) sum to 289 units. Given the holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock target will be approximately the median demand over the protection interval. My parameters use recent_N to reflect the current lower demand environment while maintaining the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system shows 49 units on-hand and 269 units in-transit. Based on the history, lead time has been consistently 4 periods. The current pipeline (in-transit) consists of orders from Periods 12 (139), 13 (0), 14 (17), and 15 (113). The order from Period 12 is expected to arrive during the current Period 16 resolution phase. Demand analysis: Early periods (P1-P8) averaged ~114 units, but from P9-P15, demand shifted lower. The last 7 periods (P9-P15) show an average demand of 85 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84, 111, 84). I will use N=7 to capture this lower regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate base_stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. With 139 units arriving this period, the ending inventory will be bolstered, but the OR engine needs to account for the total pipeline (269) relative to a base stock of approximately 425 (85 * 5). Use 'calculate' for L as the lead time of 4 is stable.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand analysis shows a significant and sustained drop starting around Period 9. The average demand has shifted from ~114 (Periods 1-8) to ~80 (Periods 9-15). Most recently, Period 16 showed an extreme outlier of 28, which pulls the recent average even lower. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (Periods 9-16) to capture this lower regime (approx 74 units/period). Given the promised lead time of 4, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 5 * 74 = 370. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, consistently confirmed by history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift further confirmed: average demand from Period 9 to 16 is ~74 units/period, significantly lower than the initial ~114 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 18 shows on-hand inventory of 117 and in-transit units of 237. Reviewing history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods until Period 17, where the order from Period 13 (arrived=0) did not appear. However, the order in Period 13 was for 0 units. We are currently waiting for orders from Period 14 (17 units), Period 15 (113 units), and Period 16 (107 units), all of which are within the promised 4-period lead time. Demand analysis shows a significant downward shift starting around Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 17 is approximately 74 units/period, with a notable drop to 43 and 28 units in the most recent two periods. Due to the high inventory levels (354 total pipeline + on-hand) relative to the current low demand regime (~74 per period, or 370 for L+1), and the recent extremely low samples, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the lower demand regime while remaining sensitive to the volatility. L remains default as there is no conclusive evidence of a lead time shift yet (the 'missing' arrival in P17 was a 0-order).

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime: From Period 9 to 17, demand has averaged 74.4 units/period, significantly lower than the prior 114 average. The last two periods (P16-P17) show a further localized drop (avg 35.5), though not yet sustained enough to call a new regime.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting around Period 9. While the average from Period 9 to 15 was approximately 86 units, the last three periods (P16, P17, P18) have shown much lower demand (28, 43, 40 respectively, averaging 37). This suggests a new low-demand regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on observed arrivals (P14 order arrived in P18). Current inventory position includes 94 units on hand and 236 units in-transit. An order from Period 13 (0 units), Period 15 (113 units), Period 16 (107 units), Period 17 (0 units), and Period 18 (16 units) are effectively in the pipeline. Given the low recent demand (avg ~37) and high pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (avg ~51) to avoid over-ordering, while maintaining the standard lead time L=4. This balances the risk of high holding costs ($1/unit) against current stock levels.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Period 16-18 demand averaged 37 units/period, a ~50% drop from the Period 9-15 average of 86 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-93.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple downward shifts. The most recent regime, identified starting around Period 16, shows a significant drop. Demand in Period 19 was 57, which is higher than the previous 3-period average of 37 but still confirms the overall lower demand regime (avg ~42 over the last 4 periods). On-hand inventory is currently high (150 units), which exceeds three periods of the current average demand. Additionally, there are 123 units in-transit (orders from P16 and P18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of order P15 in Period 19. Due to high on-hand levels and pipeline stock relative to the new lower demand, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs, which are equal to profit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime Period 16-19: Average demand is 42 units/period, confirming a sustained drop of ~50% from the Period 9-15 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-171.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was around 114 units (P1-P8) then dropped to ~80 (P9-P15). Since Period 16, demand has dropped further, averaging approximately 42.2 units per period (P16: 28, P17: 43, P18: 40, P19: 57, P20: 43). The on-hand inventory is currently very high at 214 units, which is roughly 5 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. The order from Period 13 appears lost as it should have arrived in Period 17 (P13 + 4), but we have seen arrivals for P14, P15, and P16 since then. Given the high on-hand inventory and the low demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the current low-demand environment. This will likely result in zero orders until the excess inventory is cleared, effectively reducing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the new, lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand regime for Period 16-20 is confirmed at an average of 42.2 units/period, a significant sustained reduction from earlier periods. Period 13 order (0 units) is technically 'lost' but since the order quantity was 0, it has no impact on inventory; the pipeline is currently 16 units (ordered P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-148.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the on-hand inventory is 181 units, which is extremely high relative to the current low-demand regime. The demand regime from Period 16 to 21 has averaged approximately 40.7 units/period (28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33), confirming a sustained downward shift from previous averages. The Lead Time appears stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 16 order in Period 20. The pipeline contains 16 units (ordered in Period 18, expected arrival in Period 22). Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) and current on-hand levels which cover more than 4 periods of future demand (181 / 40.7 \u2248 4.4 periods), the objective is to prevent further ordering and allow the excess stock to deplete. I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent regime (P16-P21) and set L to default. This will result in a low base stock, and because current inventory + pipeline > base stock, the backend will naturally order 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P16-P21 confirmed at avg 40.7 units/period, down from ~74 units (P9-P15) and ~114 units (P1-P8).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level (mean ~41.8 units/period over P16-P22). Current on-hand inventory (148 units) is extremely high compared to this demand level, equivalent to approximately 3.5 periods of coverage. Promised lead time remains 4 periods, and historical arrivals consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. My strategy is to minimize further ordering to draw down the excess inventory and reduce holding costs. I use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (P16-P22). With on-hand (148) + in-transit (7) = 155, and a projected base stock roughly around 250 ((1+4)*42 + safety stock), the backend OR engine will compute a low or zero order, which is desired to burn off the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for Period 16-22 is established at an average of 41.8 units/period, roughly 50% of the P9-P15 level.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to 23 is 41.1 units/period. The current on-hand inventory (112) plus in-transit stock (62, consisting of orders from P22 and P23) totals 174 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock aims to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average, this requirement is approximately 205 units. Since 174 < 205, the OR backend will trigger a small replenishment order. The lead time appears stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P18 arrived P22). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the low-demand regime (P16-P23) accurately, ensuring the system doesn't over-order based on earlier high-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P16-P23 confirmed at average 41.1 units/period, roughly 50% of the previous regime (P9-P15).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 41.5 units per period over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed data (orders from P14, P15, P16, and P18 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Recent orders (P22=7, P23=55, P24=32) are in-transit; the total pipeline inventory is 94 units. Since on-hand inventory is 58, the total inventory position is 152. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My forecast for mu_hat is 5 * 41.5 = 207.5. The current inventory position (152) is below this target, so the OR backend will place an order to reach the base stock level. I will use recent_N (N=9, corresponding to the start of the current demand regime at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the significant sustained drop in demand and volatility compared to the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for P16-P24 confirmed at average 42.6 units/period, maintaining the stable approximately 50% reduction relative to the P9-P15 regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 42.6 units/period (average from P16-P24). The inventory situation is tight: on-hand inventory is down to 2 units, but there is a large in-transit pipeline of 153 units. The 153 units in-transit consist of orders from P22 (7), P23 (55), P24 (32), and P25 (59). Following the promised lead time of 4 periods, the P22 order (7 units) is expected to arrive during P26 resolution. Although on-hand is low, the pipeline significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods * 42.6 \u2248 213 units). However, the base stock calculation at a 50% service level (where profit = holding cost) targets covering demand for (L+1) periods. My parameters maintain the current regime average (N=10 for mu_hat to cover P16-P25) and use the recent volatility (N=10 for sigma_hat) to stabilize order quantities against the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand spiked to 77 units, exceeding the recent average (approx. 43 units) and the starting on-hand inventory of 9, resulting in a stockout (sold=9). On-hand inventory is now 0. In-transit inventory is 207 units, including orders from Periods 23 (55 units), 24 (32 units), 25 (59 units), and 26 (61 units). The order from Period 23 is expected to arrive in Period 27 (the current period) since the lead time is consistently 4 periods. While P26 demand was high, it is a single data point; I will use a slightly larger N (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to account for this potential upward shift while remaining anchored in the recent 40-50 range. The backend calculation will attempt to bring inventory up to a base stock covering the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 26 (77 units) broke the sustained low-demand regime (avg ~43). Monitoring for a potential upward trend or return to the P9-P15 regime.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently experiencing a significant demand uptick that started in Period 26. Demand in Period 26 was 77 and Period 27 was 75, compared to the previous regime average of ~43. This suggests a return to the Period 9-15 regime (avg ~84). Structurally, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have suffered lost sales for two consecutive periods. While in-transit inventory is high (217 units total), 154 of those units were ordered in Periods 24-27 and won't arrive for 1-4 more periods. Specifically, Period 24's order (32 units) should arrive this period (P28), and Period 25's order (59 units) in P29. Given the high stockout risk and the apparent shift back to a higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the higher demand seen recently (approx 75 units/period) using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the spike. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level to cover the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling (1+L)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'calculate' for L as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 26: Demand increased from ~43 units to ~76 units average over the last two periods (P26-P27), signaling a return towards the P9-P15 demand levels.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting in Period 26. While the last three periods averaged 66.3 units (77, 75, 47), the recent Period 28 saw a dip to 47, suggesting the recovery to previous high-demand levels (P9-P15 average ~86) is volatile. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 274 units in transit (expected arrivals over the next 4 periods). With a critical service level (q=0.5) where the backend targets the mean (z=0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new, albeit volatile, upward trend. This reflects the most recent local average of 66.3 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to this recent average (which the backend will scale to 5 periods) balances the need to replenish stock after recent stockouts without over-committing if demand stabilizes lower than the P26-P27 peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Recent 3-period average is 66.3, up from the ~43 average seen in P16-P25, but showing volatility (47 units in P28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant shift starting at Period 26. After a long period of low demand (approx. 43 units/period), the last 4 periods (P26-P29) have seen demand spike to 77, 75, 47, and 75 respectively, resulting in a new 4-period average of 68.5. This warrants a shift in forecasting method to account for this higher-demand regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and units sold in the last 4 periods have been limited by supply (stockouts occurred in P26-P29). There are 273 units in-transit: orders from P26 (61), P27 (65), P28 (89), and P29 (58). Given the promised lead time (L=4) remains stable in observed data, and service level balance is required (profit=1, holding=1), I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current upward demand trend and ensuremu_hat covers the (L+1) window effectively. Note: P13 order was 0, and P17 order was 0, so no physical arrivals were expected for those periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 26: Average demand increased from ~43 to 68.5 units/period (based on P26-P29 samples), signaling a return toward higher volume consumption.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from a low of ~43 units/period (P16-P25) to a significantly higher level. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 73.2 units/period (77, 75, 47, 75, 92), with the most recent sample hitting a high of 92. This return to higher demand has resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for the last 5 periods), meaning our supply is trailing the current demand shift. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by recent arrivals (P26 order arrived P30). With 282 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, we need to set parameters based on the new higher-demand regime (N=5) to ensure the backend base-stock calculation accounts for this growth and captures the necessary pipeline. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility and volume of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed starting Period 26: Average demand over P26-P30 (5 periods) is 73.2 units/period, compared to the previous ~43 units average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 26. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), the average demand is 70.2 units/period (77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55). While there is some volatility (notably P28 and P31), the overall level is consistently higher than the previous 43 unit average. I am using N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current regime. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods according to all recent 'conclude' messages (P26-P31 arrivals). On-hand inventory is low (10 units), and while there is 301 units in-transit, the system has experienced stockouts or near-stockouts in the last 6 periods (ending on-hand 0 for five out of six periods). Maintaining the recent_N=6 approach ensures we project this higher demand across the (1+L) window to ensure the OR backend orders enough to rebuild a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: average demand over P26-P31 (6 periods) is 70.2 units/period, compared to the previous ~43 units average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 26. Since then (P26-P32), demand has averaged 71.4 units/period (samples: 77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79). This is a significant increase from the previous regime of ~43. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 20, and the pipeline consists of orders from P29 (58), P30 (70), P31 (84), and P32 (40), totaling 252 units. Based on the (L+1) logic (4+1=5 periods), and a mean demand of ~71.4, the required base stock should be around 357 units. The current inventory + pipeline (20 + 252 = 272) is below this requirement. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-activity regime while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Confirmed demand regime (P26-P32) average is 71.4 units/period, a sustainable increase from the ~43 average of P16-P25.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 33 (8 periods) is approximately 77.0 units/period (compared to the ~43 average in the preceding regime). Specifically, the last sample (P33) showed a peak of 116 units, indicating the trend might still be increasing or volatile. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 280 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, to recover from the stockouts seen in Periods 26-30 and Period 33, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this higher-volume regime (P26-P33). This ensures the base stock reflects the recent average of ~77 instead of the long-term average which is diluted by the previous low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime (P26-P33) average increased to 77.0 units/period, roughly an 80% increase from the P16-P25 average.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from an average of ~43 units to a significantly higher level. Over the most recent 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is 77.2 units/period, which aligns with the carry-over insight noted in Period 34. The system is currently experiencing frequent stockouts because a pipeline of roughly 315 units is being measured against a cycle that requires significantly more inventory to handle a (L+1) period window with high volatility. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the demand has increased by nearly 80% compared to the P16-P25 period, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to capture this higher-volume regime fully. Sigma_hat is also set to N=9 to account for the increased variance seen in this higher range (e.g., jumps from 55 to 116). This will allow the OR backend to compute a higher base stock and rebuild on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime (P26-P34) average is 77.2 units/period; volatility has increased alongside mean demand compared to the P16-P25 era.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 26. Analyzing the window from P26 to P35 (10 samples), the average demand is 77.9 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The most recent period (P35) had a demand of 84. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the conclusion of orders from P27 through P31). Although on-hand inventory is currently 0, there is a substantial pipeline of 303 units. Given the high volatility (sigma) relative to the mean in this new regime, and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (suggesting a target service level of 50%, though typically the backend OR policy targets higher based on the logic described), I will use the recent 10 periods to capture this higher demand and volatility. Setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the model reacts to the sustained higher mean (approx. 78) and the increased variance compared to the previous low-demand era (P16-P25).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime (P26-P35) confirmed: Average demand is 77.9 units/period, a ~80% increase from the P16-P25 average (42.6). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 26) shows a sustained shift to a higher average. Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the average demand is approximately 76.1 units/period, compared to the previous ~43 units. Although the stockouts in recent periods (P33, P34, P36) limit the 'actual' demand visibility, the trend is consistently upward. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture this higher volume regime. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as seen in recent conclusions. Demand volatility has also increased with the mean shift, so sigma_hat will be calculated using the same 11-period window to ensure sufficient safety stock. Pipeline inventory is currently high (350 units), which will naturally regulate the order size to prevent overstocking once arrivals catch up.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26, following a significant increase. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 37 is approximately 78.5 units/period (total 942 over 12 periods). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) following a stockout/near-stockout period, and the pipeline is significant at 306 units (orders from P34-P37). Since we are in Period 38 and the game ends at Period 50, we need to maintain a service level that captures this sustained higher demand while managing the risk of excess inventory as we approach the end of the game. I will continue using the recent_N method based on the current regime starting at P26 (N=12) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculated lead time which is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime from P26-P37 is confirmed stable at an average of 78.5 units/period, roughly 80% higher than the P16-P25 period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 38 (13 samples), the average demand is 78.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 32 and a significant pipeline of 285 units (orders from P35-P38), the goal is to maintain the base stock level reflective of this current regime. Using recent_N=13 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 captures this regime's characteristics accurately. The OR backend will calculate a base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand, ensuring sufficient coverage for the next 5 periods while the pipeline continues to arrive.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26. Based on the data from Period 26 through Period 39 (14 samples), the average demand is 77.7 units per period. The most recent demand observations (P37-P39) are consistent with this average (82, 77, 77). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 27, and in-transit is 289. Given that total pipeline plus on-hand (316) covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (77.7 * 4 = 310.8), but we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 388.5 total needed), the OR engine will place a replenishment order based on the 'recent_N' parameters set for the current regime (N=14). This ensures the stock levels are robust against the sustained ~78 units/period demand pattern while maintaining the appropriate service level where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P26-P39 is confirmed stable at an average of 77.7 units/period. The increase from the previous regime (~43) is sustained over 14 periods.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 77.7 units per period (P26-P40). Period 40's demand (74) and ending inventory (40) align with this trend. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 40 and 279 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 37, 38, 39, and 40), the pipeline is healthy. I will continue using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the current stable regime (P26-P40) and will maintain the default lead time of 4.

The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, with a confirmed average demand of approximately 77.7 units over the P26-P39 window. Most recent demand (P40, P41) shows values of 74 and 69, consistent with this regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (13 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 309 units. I will set L to 4 using the calculate method. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=16 (covering P26 to P41) to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the older, significantly lower demand periods. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~78 units/period mean and its associated volatility, maintaining a high service level while the OR backend manages the pipeline and prevents over-ordering through the capping mechanism.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 remains active, with an average of approximately 76.2 units/period (P26-P42). Period 42 showed a significant drop in demand (42 units), but this is currently treated as volatility rather than a regime shift, matching previous dips (e.g., P28). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 55, and in-transit inventory is 291 (P39-P42 orders). The base stock target must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent_N method with N=17 (covering P26 to P42) identifies the current mean and variance accurately for the OR backend. This approach maintains sufficient service levels as the game nears completion (Period 50), while accounting for the recent increase in demand volume compared to the middle periods of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P26-P42) average is 76.2 units/period, showing sustained ~80% increase over the P16-P25 average (42.6), though P42 showed a localized dip (42).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 26, with an average of approximately 76.2 units/period (P26-P43). Although Period 42 showed a localized dip (42 units), Period 43 returned to the mean (76 units), suggesting the regime remains intact. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 55 and a substantial pipeline (in-transit) of 247 units, the system is well-covered for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods \xd7 ~76 units = 380 units total need; 55 on-hand + 247 in-transit = 302 units total cover). The current pipeline includes orders from periods 40 (77), 41 (72), 42 (66), and 43 (32). I will set mu_hat using the recent 18 samples (since the P26 regime shift) and use recent_N for sigma to capture the elevated volatility of this regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 remains active, with an average demand of 77.5 units across P26-P44. Period 44 saw a significant spike (137 units) which depleted on-hand inventory to 0. The current in-transit (246 units) consists of orders from P41 (72), P42 (66), P43 (32), and P44 (76). With a lead time of 4 periods, the P41 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P45. To ensure coverage for the L+1 window (5 periods) given the recent volatility and the stockout in P44, I am setting mu_hat using the 19-period window since the regime shift at P26 (N=19) to capture the higher mean and increased variance accurately. This method helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for both the increased average demand and the recent fluctuations, aiming to recover from the current stockout without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand volatility noted within the P26-P44 regime; Period 44 recorded the highest demand of the regime (137 units), leading to a stockout.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 is confirmed with an average of approximately 77.7 units per period. Recent periods have shown increased volatility, with a major spike in Period 44 (137 units) and a significant dip in Period 42 (42 units). The last few periods (P44-P45) have resulted in stockouts despite arrivals because demand exceeded available inventory. Inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 288 units. To ensure the base stock levels react to this recent high-volatility, higher-demand environment without overcompensating for the single P44 spike, I am using recent_N with N=20 to capture the full breadth of the current regime (P26-P45). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 is stable with an average of approximately 78.5 units/period, despite high volatility (e.g., Period 44 saw 137 units, while Period 46 saw 39). The inventory position is currently 27 units on-hand with 332 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high demand spikes recently (Period 44), I'm using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=21 (covering the current regime from P26-P46) to ensure the backend reflects this higher-volume, higher-variance state. This will maintain a sufficient base stock to protect against stockouts seen in Periods 44 and 45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 78 units per period (P26-P47 average is 77.2). Recent demand shows some high-end volatility (e.g., 137 units in P44 and 82 units in P47), which has caused intermittent stockouts (On-hand is currently 0). The pipeline inventory is healthy at 329 units, with 76 units expected to arrive in Period 48 (ordered P44). To maintain service levels given high holding costs relative to profit ($1 each), I am using a recent window (N=22, covering the start of the current regime at P26) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the sustained 80% increase in demand from the previous low-demand regime while capturing the increased volatility observed recently. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 remains active, with an average of approximately 78 units per period, despite some localized volatility (e.g., P44 high of 137, P46 low of 39). The current on-hand inventory is 0, with a pipeline of 313 units. Since we are at Period 49 of a 50-period game, our goal is to satisfy the remaining demand for Period 49 and Period 50. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P48 conclude message). Given the order-to-delivery timing, an order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current state. I will use the recent regime (P26-P48, N=23) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the ~78 average demand and observed volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable and confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 is sustained, with a calculated average of approximately 78.4 units over the last 24 periods (P26-P49). While there are localized fluctuations (e.g., P44 high of 137, P46 low of 39), the mean has stabilized. The current lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. With 41 units on-hand and 278 units in-transit (orders from P46-P49), the pipeline is well-stocked. To maintain the service level while accounting for the recent volatility (std dev ~22), I will use the recent regime (last 24 periods) for mean and standard deviation calculations. This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained higher demand levels established since the shift at Period 26.
