Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we have no historical lead time results to calculate actual performance; therefore, L is set to the promised 4 periods. The provided historical demand samples (Period 1-5) for 'chips(Regular)' show an average of 95.6 and a standard deviation of 27.2. Using a base-stock policy that covers L+1 periods (5 periods total), the expected demand mu_hat is approximately 478 (95.6 * 5). Since this is the start of the game with zero on-hand inventory and the lead time is substantial, a slightly conservative mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available samples are chosen to establish the initial pipeline. No changepoints are detected yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 140 units, which are in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect these to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 historical periods was [82, 89, 65, 106, 136], averaging 95.6. However, Period 1 demand was 85 units. Since there is no on-hand inventory, 0 units were sold. For the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' (4) as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised. 2) mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 (the historical samples), which the backend will use to calculate expected demand over (1+L) periods. Using the last 5 samples captures the recent upward trend seen in Periods 4 and 5 (106 and 136). 3) sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). Consequently, on-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 (85 units) and Period 2 (129 units). The 'In-transit' quantity of 280 units correctly reflects the sum of orders from Period 1 (140) and Period 2 (140). Demand for the first 5 samples provided in the prompt shows an increasing trend: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136. Specifically, the latest realized demand (Period 2 conclude) was 129, and the historical sample for Period 5 is 136, suggesting a significant upward shift compared to the early samples. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=3) to capture this rising demand trend while maintaining the default lead time of 4 until observations suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (140 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our on-hand inventory has remained at 0, while in-transit inventory is 440 units (140 from P1 + 140 from P2 + 160 from P3). Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows an upward trend: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136 (from historical samples) and recent results of 85, 129, 132 (Periods 1-3). The average demand over the last 5 samples is approximately 105.6. To account for the recent growth and the lead time (L=4), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the current upward trend while maintaining a buffer for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (140 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and all demand has been lost, which is expected given the lead time. Demand history (85, 129, 132, 108, and the user-provided 136 for Period 5) shows an upward trend compared to the initial samples. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 118 units. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 1+4=5 periods of demand. Current in-transit is 594 units. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand mean and variance while keeping L at the promised default of 4 for now, as no arrivals have concluded yet to prove otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2420.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are 82, 89, 65, 106, 136, but actual demand recorded in 'conclude' messages (P1-P5) was 85, 129, 132, 108, 128 (Mean ~116.4, Std ~19.5). The first order from P1 arrived in P5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is low (12) because we only just received the first shipment. The pipeline (in-transit) is 529 units (P2 order: 140, P3: 160, P4: 154, P5: 75), which significantly exceeds the base stock needs for a 5-period horizon (L+1=5). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher demand levels observed in the conclude messages compared to the initial samples, while keeping L at default (4). The backend will see high in-transit and likely place a smaller (or zero) order until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Demand mean is approximately 116 units/period based on the first 5 conclude messages, which is higher than the provided historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1868.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_7. Looking at the conclude messages, the lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). The actual demand observed during the game (P1 to P6) has a mean of 113.8, which is significantly higher than the pre-game historical mean (95.6). This represents a clear demand regime shift. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this higher mean for mu_hat. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 4, as it aligns with recent observations. For sigma_hat, recent_N (N=6) will better reflect the volatility observed in-game (std dev \u2248 17.5) compared to the pre-game samples. This approach ensures the base stock (1+L) * mu_hat covers 5 periods of higher-than-expected demand while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher than pre-game data: Avg demand (P1-P6) is ~114 vs pre-game ~96 (+18.7%). Lead time 4 is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2009.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P3 order arrived in P7). Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the pre-game samples (avg P1-P7 is 113.4 vs pre-game 95.6). Current on-hand is 100 with 428 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). To maintain a proper base stock covering (L+1) periods, I will use a window of the last 7 periods (entirety of game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the elevated demand regime while smoothing out period-to-period noise. Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2426.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages for Periods 5-8 confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (matches promised). Since arriving in inventory at P5, actual demand has been consistently higher than the pre-game history: the average for P1-P8 is 116 units/period, compared to the pre-game average of 95.6. The last 4 periods (P5-P8) show an average of 118.5. Inventory is currently recovering from the initial lead-time stockout, with 120 on-hand and a healthy pipeline of 377 units. To optimize for the profit/holding cost ratio (z-score approximately 1.64 for 95% service level), I will use the last 8 game periods (N=8) to estimate mean demand and variance, as this captures the actual environment better than the pre-game samples while smoothing recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean across the first 8 game periods is 116 units (+21% vs pre-game 96). Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1345.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, current On-hand is 118 with In-transit of 447. Analyzing the game history (P1-P9), the mean demand is 111.67 units/period, which is significantly higher than the pre-game average of 95.6. The last period (P9) saw a dip in demand (77 units), but given the previous volatility (standard deviation ~20.6), I'm treating the higher mean as the valid regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P5). Since we are currently in a stable demand regime post-startup, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture all available in-game demand data, including the higher-than-expected early demand and the recent dip. This will allow \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the observed variance while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost. L=4 is confirmed and stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1202.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe stable lead times of 4 periods. Since the start of the game, the demand mean for chips(Regular) has settled around 107.7 units over 10 periods, which is higher than the pre-game samples (avg 96.8). However, recent demand (P9-P10) has dropped to an average of 74.5, suggesting a potential downshift or high variance. The current game-wide mean (P1-P10) is 107.7. Given the inventory position (on-hand 166 + in-transit 398 = 564 units) and a lead time of 4, our coverage should span 5 periods of demand. 564 / 5 = 112.8 units per period, which aligns well with the game average. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher game-time demand mean compared to pre-game data, while allowing the OR backend to handle the standard deviation across this same window.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean across 10 game periods is 107.7 units (+11% vs pre-game 96.8). Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1735.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 146 units and 380 units in-transit. Analyzing the demand history (P1-P11), the mean is 107.0 units, which is a meaningful increase (+10.5%) from the pre-game mean of 96.8. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern (P7 order arrived in P11). Since there have been no recent regime shifts in demand over the last 5-6 periods, I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the actual game demand environment rather than the pre-game samples. L is set to 'calculate' to utilize the observed lead-time history.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU shows a recent downward trend in demand. The most recent 4 periods (P9-P12) averaged 79 units, compared to the P1-P8 average of ~116. This suggests a demand regime shift or a post-peak cooling period. Total inventory (On-hand: 181 + In-transit: 368 = 549) is currently sufficient to cover over 5 periods of demand at the higher historical average (107-116/period), indicating a risk of overstocking if demand continues at the current lower rate (~80/period). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a service level, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent deceleration. This will allow the base stock to adjust downward reflecting the lower consumption rate of the last 5 periods (mean ~83.2).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~116 (P1-P8) to ~83 (P9-P12), a reduction of approx 28%. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1354.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 13 continues to hold. Demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged 80 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84), which is significantly lower than the average of 116 units during the first 8 periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 242 and in-transit at 225 (ordered periods 10-13), our pipeline is currently high relative to the new demand mean. Setting L to the promised 4 periods via 'calculate'. To adapt to the lower demand regime and avoid excessive holding costs, I am using a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=5 captures the behavior since Period 9. This will set a base stock level around (1+4)*80 = 400 plus safety stock, which aligns with our current inventory and should limit further ordering until stock levels normalize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1907.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the order from Period 10 exactly on time. Demand continues to show a lower regime compared to the early periods of the game. Comparing the demand from Period 1 to 8 (average ~116) against the demand from Period 9 to 14 (average ~85.16), there is a sustained drop of approximately 26.6%. The current on-hand inventory of 202 plus in-transit inventory of 154 (total 356) for the next 5 periods (L+1) is significantly higher than required for the current demand regime (85.16 * 5 = 425.8, but with 202 on hand and trailing arrivals, inventory is accumulating). To prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost implies a 95% service level), I will use the recent demand trend (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which more accurately reflects the Current market state than the total game average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from P9-P14 is 85.2 units, a 26.6% decrease from the P1-P8 average of 116 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1417.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 16, the data confirms a sustained lower demand regime starting around Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 15 is 85 units per period, compared to 116 units in the initial periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by the continuous flow of arrivals (Period 11 order arrived in Period 15). Currently, on-hand inventory is 179 units and in-transit is 206 units (from orders in P12, P13, P14, P15), making the total pipeline 385 units. Given the lower demand mean, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the current lower demand level (~85 * 5 = 425 for L+1). This ensures the base stock target reflects the recent shift while accounting for the lead time, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level since the profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $290.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing chips(Regular). The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16). Demand has shown a significant decrease starting around Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 16 is approximately 78.1 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84, 111, 84, 28). Period 16 recorded an unusually low demand of 28 units, which may be an outlier or signal further deceleration; however, I will use recent_N=8 to capture this lower demand regime (P9-P16) while smoothing some noise. On-hand inventory is 242 and in-transit is 212, totaling 454 units. With L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods), our base stock target based on the recent mean (~78) would be around 390-440 units depending on variance. Our current position is slightly above the immediate requirement, which is appropriate given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). I'll use method 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters to reflect the sustained lower demand level since Period 9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Period 16 demand dropped to 28 units, dragging the P9-P16 average down to 78.1 units compared to the P1-P8 average of 116 units (-32%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift. From P1-P8, the average demand was approximately 116 units. However, from P9-P17, the average dropped to approximately 74 units (a 36% decrease). Most recently, in P16 and P17, demand was exceptionally low at 28 and 43 units respectively. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With current on-hand inventory at 201 and in-transit at 236, the total pipeline is 437 units, which is quite high relative to the new demand regime. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the start of the lower demand period from P9 to P17) to capture this downward trend without over-reacting to the single P16 outlier. L is set to calculate as it is confirmed stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Average demand P9-P17 is ~74 units, a 36% drop from the P1-P8 average of 116 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $599.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant downward shift. From Period 1 to Period 8, the average demand was approximately 116 units. Starting from Period 9, the demand significantly dropped, and in the most recent periods (P16-P18), it has plummeted further to an average of just 37 units (28, 43, 40). The average for the P9-P18 interval is approximately 73 units, but the last three periods suggest it may be settling even lower. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the 'lead_time was 4' notes in conclude messages). Current on-hand is 161, with 264 in transit. Total pipeline (425) is more than sufficient to cover a 5-period window (L+1) even if demand returns to the intermediate regime (~75/period). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the lower demand regime while accounting for the most recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease intensified: Average demand for P16-P18 is 37 units/period, down from the P9-P15 average of 85 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $866.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant and sustained decline. The initial high demand (P1-P8 avg: 116) dropped to an intermediate phase (P9-P15 avg: 85) and has recently bottomed out (P16-P19 avg: 42). Period 19 demand was 57. The current on-hand inventory (217) and in-transit (177) are very high relative to this new low-demand regime, risking significant holding costs. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (P16-P19) to reflect this collapse in demand and prevent further over-ordering while the system burns through excess inventory. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat (N=4) will compute (1+L)*mean_demand, where mean_demand (~42) is calculated from the last 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift floor confirmed: Average demand for P16-P19 is 42 units/period, a 63% decrease from the P1-P8 baseline of 116 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $546.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts: first in Period 9 and then moving into a substantially lower floor around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 20 is approximately 42.2 units per period (28, 43, 40, 57, 43). This is significantly lower than the initial baseline (~116). We are currently in an overstock position with 271 units on-hand and 80 units in-transit (total 351). Given the current demand regime, a supply of 351 units covers over 8 periods of demand. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the required base stock for a (L+1)=5 period window, the OR backend will likely order 0 units, which is appropriate to burn off excess inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand floor and L to 4 to match historical stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced two distinct downward regime shifts. The first occurred around Period 9 (shifting from ~116 to ~85), and the second starting Period 16 (shifting from ~85 to ~44). Average demand over the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is 40.6 units. Lead time is highly stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 264 units and a pipeline of 54 (total 318), the current stock covers nearly 8 periods of recent average demand, significantly exceeding the (L+1)=5 period coverage requirement. The OR backend's base-stock target will naturally be lower than current inventory levels due to the demand drop, and the order cap (based on statistical mean) will prevent excessive ordering. Using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat most accurately captures the current low-demand floor (~41 units/period) and its reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease floor confirmed at Period 21: Average demand for P16-P21 is 40.7 units/period, roughly 35% of the original P1-P8 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $688.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level. Since Period 16, demand has averaged 41.8 units per period (P16: 28, P17: 43, P18: 40, P19: 57, P20: 43, P21: 33, P22: 49). Current on-hand inventory is 243 units, which is enough to cover over 5 periods of demand at the current average rate. With 26 units in-transit (ordered Period 19, expected Period 23), the pipeline remains robust. Given the high inventory and the stable lead time of 4 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' and use a 'recent_N' of 7 for demand parameters to capture the current low-demand regime (approx. 42 units/period). The OR backend will likely recommend zero orders until inventory levels normalize relative to the new demand mean.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent sequence (Periods 16-23), demand values are [28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49, 36], yielding an average of approximately 41.1 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 233 units with zero units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The required inventory level to satisfy this demand is approximately 5 * 41.1 = 205.5 units. Since the current on-hand inventory (233) already exceeds this coverage requirement and there are no incoming orders, the OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) will naturally result in zero orders, which is appropriate to reduce holding costs. I will set the parameters to reflect this recent low-demand regime using N=8 to capture the stability seen since the floor was established.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed for Periods 16-23: average demand is 41.1 units/period, representing a 65% reduction from the P1-P8 baseline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the pre-game and early-game periods. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), demand has averaged approximately 42.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 179 units, which is high given the current demand regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent regime (last 9 periods) to avoid over-ordering, while maintaining L at the calculated historical average. The OR backend will use these values to manage the high on-hand stock and only place small replenishment orders as the pipeline empties.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from approximately Period 16. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 44 units/period (28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49, 36, 54, 56). This is significantly lower than the initial baseline of ~116. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the game history. At the start of Period 26, on-hand inventory is 123 units and in-transit is 66 units (ordered in P24 and P25), totaling 189 units of pipeline inventory. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. With a mean of 44, the expected demand over 5 periods is 220 units. Our current pipeline (189) is slightly below this target. I will use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime and use the calculate method for lead time to reflect the consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed for Period 16-25: average demand is 44.0 units/period, roughly 38% of the original P1-P8 baseline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16, dropping from higher early levels (~116 down to ~85) to a lower floor. For the period range P16-P26 (11 samples), the average demand is 47.0 units. Recently, demand has shown a slight uptick (P24: 54, P25: 56, P26: 77), suggesting the floor may be rising or volatility is increasing as we head into Period 27. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P23). Current inventory (On-hand: 46) is low compared to recent demand, and there are 127 units in-transit (P24: 7, P25: 59, P26: 61). To ensure coverage over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the recent demand increase, I will use the last 11 samples (since the P16 drop) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for high-profit ($19) items while respecting the lower (but potentially recovering) demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 (P16-P26) shows an average of 47.0 units/period, with recent periods (P24-P26) showing a slight upward trend (avg 62.3).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new higher-activity regime compared to the previous lows (Periods 16-23). The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P24-P27) is 65.5 units, significantly higher than the 41.1 average of the preceding floor. In Period 27, we stocked out (ending on-hand 0), meaning some demand was likely lost. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Although the 'In-transit' quantity is 197 units, these correspond to orders from Periods 24-27 which have not arrived yet due to the consistent 4-period lead time (P24 order arrives in P28, P25 in P29, etc.). To restore service levels and prevent further lost sales during this upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the higher mean (~65.5 units) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to account for the increased volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 24: average demand increased from 41 units (P16-P23) to 66 units (P24-P27), an approximately 60% increase. Stockout occurred in Period 27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a heightened demand regime that began around Period 24. Average demand for the last five periods (P24-P28) is approximately 61.8 units, compared to the 41.1 units observed in the preceding low-demand phase. The system has suffered stockouts for the last two periods (P27 and P28) due to very low on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P24 order arriving in P28. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 276 units in-transit. To recover from the stockout and meet the heightened demand, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the upward shift (5 periods of demand at ~65 units/period) and L to the observed 4 periods. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) until new orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 24 confirmed: average demand increased from 41 units (P16-P23) to ~62 units (P24-P28). Sustained stockout occurred in Periods 27-28 due to inventory depletion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is emerging from a severe stockout caused by an upward demand shift (starting Period 24, avg ~66 units) and low pipeline inventory. Current on-hand is 0. Arriving in-transit units will only reach 0 on-hand immediately due to backlogged or current period demand. Analysis of history: Demand for P24-P29 has averaged 64 units per period (54, 56, 77, 75, 47, 75), which is a significant increase from the previous floor of ~41. The observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (P24-P29) captures this new demand regime. For sigma_hat, recent_N=6 is used to reflect the current volatility (std dev of ~13 per period). This approach ensures the OR backend uses a base stock level that targets a high service level (approx 95% given profit/holding ratio) to recover from the stockout and maintain safety stock during the next lead time window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 24 confirmed: average demand (P24-P29) is 64.0 units/period, compared to 41.1 units/period (P16-P23) (+55%). Sustained stockout occurred P27-P29 due to this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1159.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted upward starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, the average demand (excluding censored stockout data) is approximately 67 units/period (P24: 54, P25: 56, P26: 77, P27: 75, P28: 47, P29: 75, P30: 92). The stockouts in Periods 27-30 confirm that previous inventory levels were insufficient for this new regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0. There is 308 units in-transit (ordered P27-P30), meaning the next expected arrival (from P27) will occur in Period 31. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To recover from the stockout and meet the higher demand, I am using a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the uplift since Period 24. The OR engine will use this mean (approx 67) and the confirmed lead time (4) to set a base stock of approximately (1+4)*67 = 335 units. With 308 in-transit and 0 on-hand, an order of ~27 units is expected to be placed by the backend to reach the base stock target, restricted by the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward at Period 24 confirmed: average demand (P24-P30) is 68.0 units/period (ignoring stockout sales limits), compared to 41.1 units/period (P16-P23) (+65%). Severe stockouts occurred P27-P30.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a new higher regime following a period of stockouts between Periods 27 and 30. From Period 24 to 31, the inferred average demand (adjusting for stockout periods where demand exceeded available stock) is approximately 67 units per period. Specifically, Period 31 demand was 55, while the average of the last 8 periods is roughly 66.4. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is critically low at 15 units, but there is a significant pipeline of 329 units. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent upward demand shift, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the new average demand of approximately 67 units/period for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), totaling 335. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for recent demand volatility and to ensure a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 (P24-P31) has stabilized at an average of approximately 67 units/period, representing a significant recovery from the mid-game slump (~41 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward at Period 24 and has stabilized. For Periods 24-32, the average demand is 68.3 units/period (ignoring stockout-limited sales in P27-P30, and using observed demand values). The most recent period (P32) demand was 79. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since P24, there has been a significant recovery from the mid-game slump (41 units/period). I will set N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this new regime (P24-P32). This should ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current higher run rate to recover from recent stockouts and maintain a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 (P24-P32) is stable at an average of approximately 68 units/period, a ~65% increase over the previous slump (P16-P23 avg 41). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2090.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 24 is characterized by an average of 68 units/period (P24-P33), representing a 65% increase over the previous slump. There was a stockout in Period 33, where demand reached a recent peak of 116 units, exceeding on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the OR backend needs to maintain a high service level. To account for the recent upward volatility and the shift that began at Period 24, I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the entire current regime and provides a more responsive forecast than the long-term average while avoiding over-reaction to the single Period 33 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 (P24-P33) is stable at an average of approximately 71 units/period (adjusting for lost sales in stockout periods P27-P30, P33). Recent peak demand of 116 in P33 confirmed. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward at Period 24 and has remained high. Since Period 24, average demand is approximately 74.0 units/period (adjusting for lost sales during stockout periods P27-P30, P33-P34). Recent demand spikes (116 in P33 and 79 in P34) confirm this higher level. I am choosing N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (recent_N method) to capture this regime starting from P24 accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31-P34), so I am using the 'calculate' method. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 328 units in transit; setting parameters to cover the (L+1) window (5 periods) will help recover from the current stockout while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 (P24-P34) is stable at an average of approximately 74 units/period when accounting for lost sales during stockouts. Most recent periods show high volatility with a peak demand of 116 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized at a higher level than the mid-game slump. Calculating from P24 to P35, the average demand (accounting for stockouts where sold < demand) is approximately 75.8 units/period. Specifically, recent demand samples (P33-P35) are 116, 79, and 84. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) with significant pipeline inventory (343 units). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for recent high-demand peaks (e.g., 116 units), I will set L to the promised 4 periods, and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the start of the current regime at P24) to capture the upward shift and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability since P24 confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 76 units/period (P24-P35), a significant increase from the P16-P23 slump average of 41 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1064.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 24. Since Period 33, demand has frequently exceeded on-hand inventory, resulting in consecutive stockouts (P33, P34, P36). The average demand from P24 to P36 is approximately 76 units, with a notable peak of 116 in P33. The most recent demand (P36) was 83 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P35 and P36). To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($19 vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 13 periods (P24-P36) to capture this higher mean and volatility. I am using recent_N (N=13) to calculate these parameters, which will adjust the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1539.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 24. For the most recent 14 periods (P24-P37), the average demand is approximately 76 units/period, despite intermittent stockouts (P27-P30, P33, P34, P36, P37) which likely suppressed the observed values. The 'actual' demand requirement is higher than the 'sold' units. Period 37 saw another stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 81 out of 82 demand). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is ensuring sufficient pipeline to avoid further stockouts while managing the risk of the OR backend's order cap. I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (P24-P37).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability since P24 confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 76 units/period (P24-P37), a significant increase from the P16-P23 slump average of 41 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1433.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward around Period 24 and has stabilized. For the most recent 15 periods (P24-P38), the average demand is approximately 74.4 units/period, including adjustments for inventory-limited sales in stockout periods (P27-P30, P33, P34, P36, P37). The current Period 39 starts with 30 units on-hand and 336 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have been experiencing frequent stockouts in the recent high-demand regime, I am using a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (~74.4 * 5 = 372) and a recent_N of 15 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this period. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to prevent lost sales while managing holding costs.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 76 units per period. Recent observations from Period 35-39 confirm this, with demand values of 84, 83, 82, 77, and 77 (average 80.6). We have experienced intermittent stockouts (P36, P37) due to high demand volatility (peak of 116 in P33), despite lead times remaining consistent at 4 periods. With only 11 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 50), the goal is to maintain a high service level while preventing excessive ending inventory. The current on-hand inventory is 59 units, with 305 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we are ordering to satisfy demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use the last 16 samples (P24-P39) to define the current demand regime (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to better reflect the sustained recovery from the mid-game slump.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 24 at an average of approximately 76 units per period, considering both recorded sales and lost sales during stockout periods (P27-P30, P33-P34, P36-P37). In the most recent periods (P35-P40) now that stock has arrived, demand has been consistent around 74-84 units. On-hand inventory is 77, and there is a significant pipeline of 288 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. I am using the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=17 (covering the stable regime from P24 to P40) to capture this current demand level accurately while allowing the OR backend to calculate appropriate safety stock for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P24-P40 is stable with an average of ~76 units/period (adjusted for stockouts). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1246.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 24. While there were several stockout periods (P27-P30, P33-P34, P36-P37) where demand exceeded supply, the adjusted mean for the current regime (P24-P41) is approximately 76 units per period. The most recent demand (P41) was 69 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P37 order arrived in P41). On-hand inventory is 65 units, and in-transit inventory is healthy at 303 units. Given the service level requirements (19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the current stable regime from P24 to P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while ignoring the older, irrelevant low-demand slump (P16-P23) and high-demand start (P1-P8). This allows the OR backend to maintain a high service level for the current ~76 unit demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $694.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since the upward shift in Period 24. From P24 to P42, the average demand is approximately 74 units/period (accounting for stockouts in P27-P30, P33, P34, P36, and P37). Recent demand in Period 42 showed a dip to 42 units, but one observation is insufficient to declare a new regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 104 units on-hand and 288 units in-transit (covering orders from P39-P42), the pipeline is well-stocked. To maintain the service level across the remaining 7 periods (P43-P50) while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N window of 19 (P24-P42) for demand mean and volatility to reflect the current regime's stability and variance. This balances the risk of stockouts (which were frequent between P27-P37) against the risk of overstocking near the game end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1341.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 24 has established a steady regime with a mean of approximately 76 units per period, after accounting for various stockouts in the P27-P36 range. Recent demand (P40-P43) has shown values of 74, 69, 42, and 76, which averages to 65.25, slightly lower but consistent with the volatility of this SKU. Lead time is highly stable at exactly 4 periods. With only 7 periods remaining in the game (P44-P50), and an in-transit pipeline of 251 units plus 103 on-hand, we are well-covered for the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical stability, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the current regime's behavior (P24 onwards) while allowing for recent local fluctuations to inform the safety stock calculation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent significant spike, with Period 44 demand hitting 137 units, well above the previous stable average of ~76. The period P24-P44 mean is approx 77.2 units, but the last 5 periods (P40-P44) average 79.6, and the single most recent data point (137) suggests a possible new upward shift or high volatility event (like a holiday or seasonal peak). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 21 periods (P24-P44) to capture the current regime, but I will adjust the OR backend to be slightly more responsive by using recent_N for both mean and volatility. Given the stockout risk seen in late Period 20s/30s when demand shifted, keeping base stock robust is preferred over minimizing holding cost at this stage (Period 45/50).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed at Period 44 (137 units), significantly higher than the P24-P43 average (~74). This may indicate a new regime or a seasonal peak.

=== Period 45 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1767.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend recently. Period 44 saw a spike to 137 units, and Period 45 recorded 94 units. The average demand from Period 38 to 45 (the last 8 periods) is approximately 81.4 units/period, compared to the previous long-term average of 76. To respond to this recent volatility and ensure sufficient coverage for the remaining 5 periods of the game, I am focusing on the most recent 10-period demand regime (Period 36-45), which averages 81.1 units. The lead time has remained consistently stable at 4 periods throughout the game. With 291 units in-transit and 19 on-hand, a slightly elevated mu_hat is used to maintain service levels against potential further spikes, as seen in Period 44.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 44 (137 units). The 8-period average (P38-P45) is 81.4 units, indicating a moderate increase from the stable P24-P40 average of 76 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility and a slight upward trend starting from Period 44 (demand spiked to 137). The recent 8-period average (P39-P46) is approximately 76 units, but considering the spikes and the need to avoid stockouts in the final periods of the game (ending P50), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (P44-P46) which captures the recent volatility (avg ~90). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining (P47-P50), I am using L=4 and recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain high service levels during this final phase, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the final game phase; most recent 3-period average (P44-P46) is ~90 units/period versus the preceding long-term stable average of 76.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1556.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. Demand has shown increased volatility in the final game phase, with a recent 3-period average (P44-P46) of approximately 90 units and a 5-period average (P43-P47) of around 85 units, compared to the previous stable baseline of 76. The game ends in 2 periods (Period 50), while the lead time is 4 periods. This means decisions for Periods 48, 49, and 50 will result in arrivals that occur after the game concludes. However, the OR backend's capped policy and base stock calculation require reasonable parameters to manage remaining on-hand risk while covering the remaining 3 periods of active demand (P48, P49, P50). I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the elevated late-game demand (~85 units/period) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for high volatility (ranging from 39 to 137). L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Final game phase (P44-P47) demand is elevated and volatile, averaging ~85 units compared to the P24-P43 average of 76. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1463.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49 of 50. The game ends in Period 50. Demand in the final phase (P44-P48) has been elevated and volatile, averaging approximately 88 units/period (adjusting for the stockout in P48 where 77 units were sold against presumably higher demand). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since orders placed now (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 53 (49 + 4), they will never arrive during the game's duration. Similarly, the order placed in Period 48 will also not arrive. We have 0 units on-hand and 481 units in-transit. The in-transit units include orders from P45 (112), P46 (121), and P47 (171), which are scheduled to arrive in Period 49, 50, and 51 respectively. Therefore, we expect 112 units to arrive during Period 49 and 121 units to arrive during Period 50. This total of 233 units should adequately cover demand for the final two periods. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent elevated demand (approx 90) and sigma_hat to reflect recently observed high volatility (std of recent samples). L remains at the promised/observed 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1348.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the final decision phase, we observe that demand has been highly volatile in the closing stages (P44-P49), with an average of approximately 85.7 units/period across the last 6 periods, compared to the previous stable average of 76. The actual lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. My strategy for this final period is to maintain a robust base stock that accounts for this higher volatility and recent demand level to maximize profit while managing the risk of stockouts. Since this is the final order of the game, I am setting parameters to ensure the replenishment covers the lead time plus one period (L+1=5) at the most recent demand regime level. I've chosen N=7 for recent_N to capture the transition from the P24-P43 stability into the higher-demand final phase.
