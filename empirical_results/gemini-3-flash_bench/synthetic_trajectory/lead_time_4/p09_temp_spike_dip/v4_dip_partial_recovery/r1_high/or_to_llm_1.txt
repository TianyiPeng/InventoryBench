Historical demand (P1-P5) shows a mean of approximately 95.6 units/period (82, 89, 65, 106, 136).

Given that we start with 0 inventory and have a 4-period lead time, we have zero protection against demand in periods 1-4. However, we must start building the pipeline immediately.

With 462 units already in the system, we are oversupplied for the next 4 cycles. However, we must place small orders to prevent a sudden stockout when the large P15/P16 orders have cleared and demand potentially reverts to the historical mean. \n\n5. **OR Comparison**: The OR recommendation of 117 units is based on the long-term historical mean (~110-120) which is heavily weighted by the high demand in periods 1-8.

However, the one-period spike might be an anomaly or a new shift; given we are at Period 45 of 50, we must ensure we don't stock out while also avoiding excessive end-of-game inventory. The OR recommendation is 128 units, based on long-term data. Pipeline analysis: P41 (30), P42 (60), P43 (50), P44 (40) = 180 total. P41 order (30) arrives in P45, P42 (60) in P46, P43 (50) in P47, P44 (40) in P48. Expected demand for the total lead-time window (P45-P49) at the stabilized rate of ~80 is 400 units.

The Carry-Over Insight from Period 46 suggests an upward shift to ~115, though Period 46 itself was low. With a profit of $19 and low holding cost of $1, the priority is avoiding stockouts, especially as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Our target stock level should cover 5 periods (L+1). At an estimated demand of ~100/period, we need ~500 units in the pipeline/on-hand. Current On-hand (21) + In-transit (358) = 379 units. The 358 in-transit includes orders from P43 (50), P44 (40), P45 (128), and P46 (140). These will arrive in P47, P48, P49, and P50 respectively. The order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the game window. However, looking at the immediate arrivals: Period 47 will receive 50 units, P48 will receive 40, P49 will receive 128, and P50 will receive 140.

While Period 46 saw a dip to 39, the overall average since Period 44 is approximately 88 units. The game is near conclusion (Period 48 of 50).\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Expected arrival this period is 40 units. This is likely insufficient to meet the current demand (expected ~80-90), leading to a likely stockout this period. Total pipeline is 435 units. \n4. Strategy: With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), any order placed now (Period 48) with a 4-period lead time will NOT arrive before the game ends at Period 50. Therefore, placing any more orders is a waste of capital and will only incur holding costs if the game logic evaluates ending inventory in the final reward, or simply provides no utility.

This suggests the high spike was temporary and the regime has settled closer to the ~75-80 range observed previously. In-transit inventory is 267 units (orders from P46, P47, and P48). Specifically: P46 (140 units) arrives P51, P47 (127 units) arrives P52. Total pipeline (267) + On-hand (55) = 322 units. This inventory must cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). At an estimated demand of 75-80 units/period, we need ~375-400 units. Our current position of 322 units is slightly short. The OR recommendation of 127 units is based on the recent high demand spikes (incorporating the 137 and 94 values) which may lead to overstocking if demand remains at ~75. However, since P49 shows the P45 order (128 units) arrived and left us with 55 on hand, and we have large batches coming in the next two periods, I will scale back the OR recommendation to 80 units to maintain a healthy safety stock without excessive holding costs.",
