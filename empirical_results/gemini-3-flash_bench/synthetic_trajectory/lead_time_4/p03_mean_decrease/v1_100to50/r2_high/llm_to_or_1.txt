Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. Historical demand shows samples: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91. The mean of these 5 samples is 109 and the standard deviation is approximately 14.7. Since we are starting at Period 1, there is no lead-time history or confirmed regime shifts. I will use 'default' for lead time (4) and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to focus on the provided historical samples. The OR backend will calculate base_stock to cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will aim for a high service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an initial order of 133 units. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, this order is currently 'In-transit' and is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5. The observation from 'Period 1 conclude' shows that demand was 83 units, but since our starting inventory was 0, those sales were lost (sold=0). The core logic for this period is to establish a stable demand forecast using the provided historical samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91). The average of these 5 samples is 109 units per period. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 1+L=5 periods of demand. Using the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate statistics based on all available samples (including the now-observed Period 1 demand of 83). While 83 is lower than the initial history, it's consistent with a slight downward trend seen in the latter half of the seeded data. I will keep the lead time at 'default' (4) as we have no evidence yet of deviations.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. In Periods 1 and 2, we ordered 133 units each (total 266 in-transit). With a promised lead time of 4, no units have arrived yet, which is expected (arrivals should begin in Period 5). The initial demand samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) suggested a mean around 109. Actual demand in P1 (83) and P2 (108) averages 95.5, which is slightly lower than the seed data but within a reasonable range. Since on-hand is 0, we have lost sales for two periods. I will use the default promised lead time (4) and set demand parameters based on all 7 available data points (5 seeds + 2 actuals) to establish a stable base. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (133, 133, and 131 units respectively). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=4) should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units are in-transit. Demand has been relatively stable (83, 108, 107 in concluded periods; samples provided are 118, 124, 116, 96, 91). The average demand of available samples is approximately 109. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Total expected demand over the lead time is ~545 units. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 397. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining stability until arrivals begin.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (arriving at the end of Period 5, visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, the zero arrivals seen so far (Periods 1-4) are consistent with a lead time of 4. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced 465 units of lost sales (demand not met). The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 109 units per period (83, 108, 107, 167). The jump to 167 in Period 4 suggests a possible upward shift or high variance. To ensure the base stock covers the demand through the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent mean of 116.25. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 512 units. With \u03bc\u0302 = 116.25 * 5 = 581.25, the OR backend will likely place a small order to bridge the gap and rebuild a safety buffer, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2307.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods was confirmed by the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5. The total in-transit units (555) reflect the orders placed in Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 (133+131+115+176 = 555). Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 83, 108, 107, 167, and 122 (Mean=117.4). However, there is a noticeable spike in Period 4 and 5 compared to earlier periods. Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward trend (averaging 132 for the last 3 samples) and 'default' for sigma_hat and L. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period lead time protection.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Demand showing increasing trend in final two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1316.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. From 'Period 6 conclude', we confirmed the lead time L=4 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 6). On-hand inventory is 71 units, and there are 593 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Historical demand samples are [118, 124, 116, 96, 91] from the prompt and [83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73] from the game history. The demand is somewhat volatile; while P5 showed a spike (167), P6 dropped to 73. Given L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use L=4 (default) and recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=6 to capture the most recent demand behavior since shipments started arriving.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2598.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (P1-P7) shows significant volatility (83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73, 140) with a mean of ~114. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is healthy (471 units in-transit). The OR engine needs parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand capture (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to smooth out the noise from the high P4 demand while respecting the recent mean. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods across 3 consecutive deliveries (P5, P6, P7 concludes). Demand shows high variance (std dev ~31) but no clear trend; mean remains around 114 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1923.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P1 to P4). The current on-hand inventory is 72 units. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 514 units, reflecting orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. Historical demand samples (P1-P8) show a mean of approximately 113.25 and a standard deviation of 28.5. Although the Carry-over Insight mentioned high variance, recent demand has fluctuated without a sustained trend shift (P5-P8 mean is 110). I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as it has been validated. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the full trajectory since the start, providing a more robust mean estimate for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. Sigma_hat will also be set using recent_N=8 to capture the observed volatility (approx. 28.5) which ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for a ~95% service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2592.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain for chips(Regular) remains stable with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, consistently observed from Period 5 through Period 9. The inventory position is currently 106 on-hand units and 429 units in-transit. Demand analysis: the raw historical data provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91) diverges from the actual game history demand (Periods 1-9: 83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73, 140, 105, 142). Calculating the mean for the 9 concluded periods gives ~116.3, with a standard deviation of ~29.7. There is no clear shift in the demand regime, so I will use a recent window (N=9) to capture the current mean and variance. Set L to default (4), mu_hat to recent_N (9) to cover L+1 periods of demand, and sigma_hat to recent_N (9) to buffer against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time reinforced at 4 periods (observed P9: order from P5 arrived). Demand mean stable at ~116 per period with standard deviation ~30.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods across five consecutive arrivals (P5 through P10 concludes). Demand has shown moderate fluctuation but remains centered around a mean of 115-120 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P6-P10) show a mean demand of 121.2, which is slightly higher than the overall average but consistent with the expected range. On-hand inventory is currently 131 units with 415 units in transit, which covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand at current rates. Given the promised lead time of 4, the system covers (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 11. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 119 units per period with a standard deviation of 30.6. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift detected in the most recent periods; demand remains stochastic within a stable range. I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the demand regime post-startup (Periods 5-11), where inventory was actually on-hand and satisfied demand, providing a more reliable mean of 115 units/period. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full variability observed since the start. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock covering L+1 (5) periods of demand, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 6\u201312) shows a shift in behavior. The mean demand for the last 7 periods is approximately 109.3 units, compared to the overall population mean of ~117 (Periods 1-12). Specifically, the last two periods (Period 11: 77, Period 12: 82) show a significant dip. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all 8 successful arrivals. With 139 units on-hand and 468 in transit (scheduled arrivals for Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 based on orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the slightly lower and more volatile recent demand environment, while maintaining the lead time 'L' as 'default' since it matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 11: Mean demand for P11-P12 dropped to ~80 units, compared to historical average of ~117. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted downwards starting at Period 11. Over the last three periods (P11-P13), demand has been 77, 82, and 91, averaging 83.3 units. This is a notable drop from the previous average of ~117. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent conclude messages (P12 and P13 both showed a 4-period lead time). With an on-hand inventory of 139 and a high pipeline of 438 units (largely from orders placed when demand was higher), the backend OR policy will likely scale back ordering significantly to avoid overstocking while adjusting to the new lower-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand for P11-P13 is 83.3 units, down ~30% from the previous mean of ~117. Sigma has also decreased during this window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1144.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a lower regime starting at Period 11. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), the observed demand values are 77, 82, 91, and 72, resulting in a mean of 80.5 units/period. This is a significant reduction from the earlier mean of ~117. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on several consecutive arrivals (P5 through P14). In Period 15, we have a relatively high on-hand inventory (224) and significant inventory in-transit (281). Given the promised lead time of 4 (L=4), the inventory needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). Based on the new mean of ~80.5, total coverage needed is approximately 402 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 505 units, which is well above the required base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this sustained lower demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the lowered volatility. L will remain at the stable 'default' of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand for P11-P14 is 80.5 units (down from ~117 original avg). Volatility has also noticeably decreased in this window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1816.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward since Period 11. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), the mean demand is 86.4 units, significantly lower than the initial historical mean of approximately 117 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With a promised lead time of 4 (L=4), the inventory needs to cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). Current on-hand inventory (274) plus in-transit stock (121) totals 395 units. Given the new mean demand of ~86, the required base stock for 5 periods is roughly 430-450 units. Therefore, current inventory levels are slightly below the desired base stock but high enough to avoid immediate shortages. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the lower demand and lower volatility observed in the most recent regime. L will remain at 'default' since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand for P11-P15 is 86.4 units (approx 26% drop from original baseline). Standard deviation has also reduced to ~15.5 in this same window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1306.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation confirms a sustained downward shift in demand starting around Period 11. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), the average demand is 85.6 units, significantly lower than the historical baseline of ~117 units. The standard deviation has also stabilized at a lower level (approx 14.5). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the Period 16 arrival. With 252 units on hand and 153 in transit, the current inventory is already high relative to this new demand regime. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this lower demand environment and prevent excessive overstocking while maintaining a safe service level for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully confirmed: P11-P16 mean demand is 85.7 units (approx 26% drop from original baseline). Volatility has reduced to ~14.5 in this window.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began in Period 11 is sustained and well-documented. For the period range P11-P17, the mean demand is approximately 83 units (77, 82, 91, 72, 110, 82, 67), which is a significant drop from the previous average of ~117. The standard deviation in this recent window is also considerably lower (approx 14.5). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 17 (P13 order arrived). With an on-hand inventory of 246 and in-transit of 165, the pipeline is relatively high compared to the lower demand regime. I will use recent_N=7 to capture the shifted demand mean and variance (from P11 onwards) while keeping L at default (4) to reflect the stable observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1154.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began in Period 11 is sustained and well-confirmed. The mean demand for the last eight periods (P11-P18) is approximately 81.4 units, which is a significant drop from the initial baseline of ~117. Volatility in this period is also lower (std dev ~14.9). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. While 'Period 18 conclude' shows 0 units arrived, this is likely because the order placed in Period 14 (which should have arrived in P18) was 0 units. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) and 'calculate' for lead time since observed arrivals have been perfectly consistent with L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand for P11-P18 is 81.4 units (approx 30% drop from baseline). Standard deviation in this window is ~14.9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $804.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. Analyzing the game history, we have seen a consistent lead time of 4 periods since early in the game. However, there has been a significant and sustained demand regime shift beginning around Period 11. Over the last 9 periods (P11-P19), the average demand has dropped to approximately 77.8 units per period, reaching a low of 49 in the most recent period. This is a substantial decrease (over 30%) from the initial baseline of ~117. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this lower volume regime accurately. For the volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using 'recent_N' with N=9, as the standard deviation in this window has decreased to approximately 17, reflecting more stable but lower demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, so 'default' is appropriate. These settings allow the OR engine to right-size the base stock for the current lower demand level, preventing excessive inventory buildup while maintaining the desired service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Mean demand for P11-P19 is ~77.8 units (approx 33% drop from baseline). In-transit orders from P14 and P15 haven't arrived yet, but given the 4-period lead time, P14 (ordered 0) and P15 (ordered 0) results from P18 and P19 show no arrivals, which is consistent. We expect orders from P16 and P17 to arrive in P20 and P21.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift first observed at Period 11 has sustained and even intensified in recent periods. Comparing the baseline demand (Periods 1-10 mean: ~117 units) to the recent regime (Periods 11-20), the mean has dropped to ~77 units, and the most recent 5 periods (Periods 16-20) show an even lower average of 62.8 units with reduced volatility (std dev ~15.2). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 16 order in Period 20. The zero-arrivals in Periods 18 and 19 were expected as the orders placed in Periods 14 and 15 were 0 units. We have 173 units on-hand and 233 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 17-20). Given the sharp drop in demand to ~63 units/period, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this most recent downward drift, ensuring the pipeline plus on-hand doesn't bloat inventory while maintaining the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified: Mean demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) has dropped to 62.8 units, significantly lower than the P11-P15 average of ~86. Standard deviation in this window is ~15.2.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift observed since Period 11 has intensified significantly over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), with the most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) showing very low demand (49, 46, 40). The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 59 units, down from the earlier 'low' regime of ~85. On-hand inventory is currently high (206 units) relative to this new demand level, and there is a total of 160 units in-transit (orders from P18, P19, and P20). Specifically, P18 (57 units) is expected to arrive during P22 resolution, P19 (61 units) during P23 resolution, and P20 (42 units) during P24 resolution. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and significantly lower demand, I will focus on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering while the system digests the existing pipeline and on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified: Mean demand for P16-P21 dropped to 59 units (approx 50% drop from the original 117 baseline and ~30% drop from the first shift level of ~85). Variance remains low.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct downward shifts. The original baseline was approximately 117 units. The first shift (around Period 11) dropped the mean to ~85. The second, more recent shift (starting around Period 16-17) has dropped the mean to approximately 49 units over the last three periods (P20: 46, P21: 40, P22: 51). The current on-hand inventory is 212 units, which is quite high relative to this new demand regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given this sharp decline in demand and the high level of existing inventory (on-hand + in-transit), I am using N=7 for the demand mean to capture the recent significant decrease while still maintaining some stability, and N=7 for sigma to reflect the lower volatility. This transition aims to prevent further overstocking while demand stabilizes at this new, lower level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified: Mean demand for the last 7 periods (P16-P22) has dropped to ~58 units, with the most recent 3 periods averaging ~46 units. This signifies a cumulative drop of over 50% from the original baseline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct downward regime shifts. The initial baseline was ~117 units. The first shift (P11-P15) dropped mean demand to ~86 units. The second, more intense shift (starting P16) has dropped the mean demand for the last 8 periods (P16-P23) to 56.4 units, with the last 4 periods averaging only 45 units. Current on-hand inventory is 230 units, which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate (~50 units/period). Including the 73 units in-transit (orders from P20 and P23), we have enough stock to cover the 4-period lead time significantly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=8 to capture the second regime shift (P16-P23) to avoid over-ordering while the system works through existing excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift solidified: Mean demand for P16-P23 is 56.4 units (~52% drop from baseline). The most recent 4 periods (P20-P23) average 45 units, suggesting a potential further stabilization at a lower level.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct downward shifts. The original baseline (~117) dropped to ~85 (P11-P15) and has since fallen further. In the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24), demand averages 44.6 units (46, 40, 51, 43, 33). This represents a decrease of over 60% from the initial period levels. Transitioning to a recent window of N=5 captures this most recent stabilization at the lower level while providing a more accurate reflection of current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P20 order in P24.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift solidified at lower level: Mean demand for P20-P24 is 44.6 units, reflecting a ~62% drop from the original baseline (~117) and a ~48% drop from the first shift level (~85).

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct downward regime shifts. The most recent demand levels (Periods 20-25) have stabilized at a much lower mean of approximately 41.5 units per period (46, 40, 51, 43, 33, 33). This is a significant drop from the initial baseline of ~117 and the first shift level of ~85. The standard deviation has also tightened considerably to around 7.5 in this most recent set. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple conclusions (P20-P24). On-hand inventory is currently high at 206 units, while the pipeline contains 64 units (from P23-P24). Given the current demand (41.5 units) and lead time (4 periods), the base stock requirement (1+L=5 periods of demand) is approximately 207 units (5 * 41.5). Since On-hand + Pipeline (206 + 64 = 270) is already well above this requirement, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=6) to reflect the current low-demand reality and prevent redundant ordering while the system works through existing excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift solidified at even lower level: Periods 20-25 average demand is ~41.5 units with low volatility (~7.5 std dev). This represents a ~65% drop from the original baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the start of the simulation. For the most recent 7 periods (P20-P26), demand averages approximately 40.7 units with relatively low volatility. Using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this current regime accurately. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving from P16 through P20 (at P20-P24). No orders were placed in P21, P22, P25, or P26, which explains the lack of arrivals in 'concluded' messages for the most recent periods. On-hand inventory (157) plus in-transit stock (64) currently exceeds the base stock level needed for this low-demand environment, so the OR backend will likely generate a zero or minimal order to allow inventory to draw down towards the target of approximately 200-240 units (coverage for L+1 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift solidified at approximately 41 units (P20-P26 average), a ~65% reduction from the original baseline. Standard deviation has stabilized near 8.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $892.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the start of the game. For the most recent 8 periods (P20-P27), the mean demand is 43.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 7.8. This represents a ~63% drop from the original baseline demand of ~117. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27 (4-period lead time). The current on-hand inventory is 134 units with 50 units in-transit (ordered in Period 24 and Period 27). Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~44 units/period, target inventory is ~220 units. Total current assets (on-hand 134 + in-transit 50) are 184 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 reflects the current demand regime, while sigma_hat using recent_N=8 captures the reduced volatility, helping balance the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio without excessive overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime solidified around 44 units (P20-P27 average), a ~63% reduction from the original baseline. Standard deviation in this regime is approximately 7.8.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 20. Checking the last 9 periods (P20-P28), the mean demand is 42.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 8.7. Specifically, over the most recent 4 periods (P25-P28), demand has been 33, 49, 54, 31 (mean 41.75). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 136 and in-transit at 74, the total pipeline is 210 units. Given a lead time of 4, the review period + lead time is 5 periods. At a mean demand of ~42, the expected needed inventory is roughly 210, which exactly matches our current total. Therefore, the base stock policy will naturally moderate ordering. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this stabilized regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and calculate for lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime solidified around 42 units (P20-P28 average), a ~64% reduction from the original baseline (~117). Standard deviation in this regime remains low (~8.7).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting around Period 20. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), demand has averaged approximately 43.6 units with a standard deviation of roughly 9.2, representing a ~63% decrease from the initial baseline levels. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrival at P28 from an order placed in P24). The zero arrival in P29 is expected because no orders were placed in P25. Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 units and in-transit is 107 units (orders from P27, P28, and P29). Total pipeline inventory is 187 units. With lead time L=4 and demand mu around 44, the target base stock (1+L) * mu is approximately 220 units. Given the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19), maintaining a slightly conservative inventory position is preferred. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and the default calculation for lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime. The mean demand for the most recent 11 periods (P20-P30) is 40.0 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 10.7. This is a significant decrease (~66%) from the initial baseline of ~117. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P23 arrived P27, P24 arrived P28). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average and use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the current low-demand environment. Although there are 166 units in transit, the back-end capped policy and the base stock calculation (which includes in-transit inventory) will manage the order quantity to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the current mean of 40 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~40 units (P20-P30 average) with a standard deviation of ~10.7. This represents a sustained 66% drop from the original baseline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting around Period 20, averaging approximately 42.7 units per period (P20-P31) with a standard deviation of roughly 14.8. Most recently, Period 31 showed a spike to 70 units, but this follows a very low Period 30 (22 units), suggesting continued variability within the new lower-demand baseline rather than a return to the original 117-unit mean. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 31 of the order placed in Period 27. On-hand inventory is currently low (5 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 174 units (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). To avoid over-ordering while ensuring coverage for the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will use the recent demand regime (N=12 for mu_hat, covering P20-P31) to set parameters. This stabilizes the base stock around 214 units, which is already mostly covered by the 179 total inventory position (5 on-hand + 174 in-transit), preventing excessive holding costs.

Although Period 31 saw a spike to 70, the subsequent Period 32 demand was back to 46. I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this entire lower-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31, P32). Pipeline inventory (183 units) is relatively high compared to current demand levels, but the OR backend's capped policy should manage new orders appropriately while the system processes the in-transit stock.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 20. For the last 14 periods (P20-P33), the mean demand is approximately 43.1 units per period. The most recent demand samples are 33, 49, 54, 31, 56, 22, 70, 46, and 31. While Period 31 saw an outlier of 70, the overall trend remains low compared to the original baseline of ~117. I will use a window of the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture this stable 'new normal' demand (~43.1) and its corresponding volatility (std dev ~14.4). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P27, P28, and P29 concluding on schedule. Current on-hand is low (18), but there is a significant in-transit pipeline (215 units) consisting of orders from P30 (59), P31 (25), P32 (66), and P33 (65). These are expected to arrive in Periods 34-37. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the backend will naturally target a high service level, but the 'recent_N' approach will prevent over-ordering by aligning the base stock with the current lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 20: Mean demand (P20-P33) is 43.1 units, a 63% reduction from the original baseline. Standard deviation in this regime is approx 14.4. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 20. The mean demand from Period 20 to Period 34 is approximately 41.9 units per period, with a standard deviation of 13.9. This represents a significant and sustained drop (~64%) from the initial baseline of ~117. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34. Currently, we have 52 units on hand and 186 units in transit. Given the target base stock (which covers 5 periods of demand at ~42 units/period, roughly 210-230 units depending on the service level), and that on-hand + in-transit already equals 238 units, the current pipeline is sufficient. I will use recent_N=15 to capture this stable low-demand window (P20-P34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculated lead time which has consistently been 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 20, averaging approximately 43 units per period with moderate volatility. Recent demand in Period 35 (55 units) was slightly higher than the regime average, but still well within the expected variance. On-hand inventory is currently low (22 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 181 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The goal is to maintain the base stock level to cover (L+1) periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 16 (Periods 20-35) to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting around Period 20. The mean demand from Period 20 to Period 36 is approximately 43.6 units per period, representing a significant (~63%) drop from the initial baseline levels of ~117. While Period 36 showed a slightly higher demand of 61, the overall regime remains much lower than the start of the game. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of orders from P31 and P32 exactly 4 periods later. The on-hand inventory is currently 27 units, with 174 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36). Using recent_N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Period 20 to 36) captures this lower stabilized regime while allowing for the recent slight uptick in volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the stable 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 20: Mean demand (P20-P36) is 43.6 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1168.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 20, dropping from a historical baseline of ~117 and an intermediate regime of ~85 to a sustained lower level. In the most recent window (P31-P37), the mean demand has risen slightly to 50.1 units per period compared to the P20-P30 average of ~40 units, suggesting a minor upward calibration within the low-demand regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 29, with 175 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). A 7-period window (recent_N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is chosen to capture the most recent stabilized demand behavior (P31-P37 mean = 50.1, std dev = 16.4) which is more representative of current conditions than the very low 40-unit average seen previously. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the recent slight increase in demand while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P31-P37 shows a slight increase to ~50 units/period (up from ~40 during P20-P30), but still significantly below the original 117 baseline. Standard deviation in this recent window is approx 16.4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we experienced a stockout (demand 83, sold 59) because the arrival (30 units) plus starting inventory (59) was insufficient to meet the sudden demand spike. Demand has shifted higher: the last 8 periods (P31-P38) average 54.25 units, significantly up from the previous ~40 unit regime. Specifically, the last four periods average 65.5 units. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the stable 4-period lead time, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this upward shift while maintaining some stability. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P34 through P38 all show 4-period lead times). Pipeline inventory is currently 223 units, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the new base stock level based on the updated \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward since Period 31: Mean demand (P31-P38) is 54.3 units (standard deviation ~19.5), up roughly 35% from the Period 20-30 average of ~40 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward shift since Period 31. The average demand from Period 31 to Period 39 is approximately 54.3 units, compared to the previous regime of ~40 units. The two most recent periods (P38 and P39) have resulted in stockouts (ending inventory = 0), indicating that current inventory levels and the OR backend's default parameters (which still weight the very low Period 20-30 regime) are insufficient for this rebound. To prevent further lost sales, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture only this latest upward shift (P31-P39). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent historical performance. The shift in demand mean and the recent stockouts necessitate a more aggressive base stock level focused on the current 54-unit mean rather than the 43-unit long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward confirmed: Mean demand from P31-P39 is 54.3 units (standard deviation ~19.5), representing a ~35% increase from the Period 20-30 trough (~40 units). Stockouts occurred in P38 and P39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a clear upward shift since Period 31, currently averaging approximately 54.3 units per period. This shift, combined with recent high-demand periods (e.g., Period 38 saw 83 units), led to stockouts in Periods 38, 39, and 40 because previous safety stock levels were calibrated for the lower ~40 units/period regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit units (275) scheduled to arrive over the next four periods (ordered in P37-P40), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this current higher-demand regime (P31-P40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a demand average of ~54 units with the associated volatility to recover from stockouts and better meet the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward since Period 31 confirmed at ~54 units/period (N=10 mean is 54.4). This follows a previous lower regime of ~40 units. Stockouts occurred in P38-P40 due to this shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has shifted upward to an average of ~54 units (P31-P41 mean is 52.7). Most recently, demand showed some volatility with a lower value of 36 in Period 41, but previous stockouts in Periods 38-40 indicate that the underlying mean is significantly higher than the previous trough (~40). I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture this current regime while maintaining the stable lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (30), but a significant in-transit pipeline (270) is expected to arrive starting next period (ordered Period 38), which should cover the demand based on the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward since Period 31 is maintained: Mean demand (P31-P41) is 52.7 units, showing recovery from the Period 20-30 trough. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1072.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward since Period 31, stabilizing at an average of approximately 52.7 units (P31-P41 mean). Recent stockouts in Periods 38-40 occurred because the inventory planning hadn't fully adjusted to this recovery from the Period 20-30 trough. For Period 43, the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P42 arrival of the P38 order). We have 49 units on hand and 220 units in transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (Profit: $19 vs Holding: $1), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility, focusing on the last 12 periods (P31-P42) to capture this 'recovery' regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) without over-ordering based on the much higher historical baseline from the start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 31 to 42 confirmed at mean ~53 units, representing a sustained partial recovery from the Period 20-30 trough (~40 units).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has stabilized at a higher level than the previous trough, with a current mean (P31-P43) of approximately 52.4 units per period (N=13). Recent demand remains somewhat volatile (std dev ~17.8), and the system experienced stockouts in Periods 38-40 due to this upward shift. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in P43 of the order placed in P39. With 88 units on-hand and 192 in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42, P43), the pipeline is relatively full. I will use recent_N=13 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current active regime since Period 31, and 'calculate' for Lead Time as it has been stable.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a mean of approximately 53 units/period since Period 31, representing a relative recovery from the Period 20-30 trough. In the most recent four periods (P41-P44), demand was 36, 59, 48, and 42, averaging 46.25 units. While slightly lower than the P31-P43 average, there is no evidence this is a new shift rather than standard variance. I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering P31 to P44) to capture this stabilized regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 90 units, and there are 192 units in-transit. The in-transit units include orders from P41 (61), P42 (28), P43 (59), and P44 (44). Given the 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals to be steady. The chosen parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 31, with a mean of approximately 54 units/period, compared to the previous trough of ~40 units. The last 10 periods (P36-P45) show a mean demand of 53.8 units and a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. This upward shift initially caused stockouts in Periods 38-40, but availability has since stabilized. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45. Currently, there are 94 units on hand and 167 units in-transit (total pipeline of 261). Using a recent_N of 15 for demand parameters captures this sustained stabilization at the ~54 unit level while covering the most recent volatility. The base stock policy will aim to cover inventory for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 31 to 45 confirmed at mean ~54 units, a sustained ~35% recovery from the Period 20-30 trough. Standard deviation in this regime has stabilized around 14.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has settled at a mean of approximately 53.4 units (P31-P46), which is a recovery from the lower trough of ~40 units but still well below the original ~117 baseline. The most recent demand (P46) was exceptionally low (15), which may be an outlier or signal a new downward shift. However, per the 'CONSERVATIVE' instruction, I will maintain the current upward-shifted regime parameters for at least 3 periods before reacting to a potential new drop. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P42 order arrived in P46). On-hand inventory is healthy at 107 units with 196 in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=16, from P31-P46) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the distant historical baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1314.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 31, currently averaging approximately 54 units per period (N=17 mean for P31-P47 is 53.4, with a slight peak in the most recent period). The previous trough of ~40 units (P20-P30) is no longer representative. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, with the P43 order arriving exactly on time in Period 47. Current on-hand inventory is 92 units, and pipeline inventory is 148 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, P47). With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 48 plus the lead time (Total 5 periods). Since we are approaching the game end (Period 50), I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the recovery regime (P31-P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets the ~54 units/period average while maintaining a high service level to avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 31 to 47 confirmed at mean ~53.4 units, maintaining a sustained partial recovery from the Period 20-30 trough (~40 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1304.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 31, currently averaging approximately 53.4 units per period (P31-P48 context). While there was a deep trough of ~40 units between Periods 20-30, the last 18 periods demonstrate a consistent partial recovery. Recent demand in P47 and P48 (74 and 72 units respectively) is slightly above this regime average, but standard volatility is still present. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 44 order in Period 48. With 64 units on-hand and 185 in-transit (covering orders from P45-P48), the pipeline is healthy. I will use N=18 for mu_hat to capture the entire 'recovery' regime (P31-P48) while allowing the OR engine to account for the most recent variance. This balances the risk of over-ordering against the goal of maintaining service levels during recent high-demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $780.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable around ~54 units/period since Period 31 (N=19 mean is 53.6 units). Recent demand in Period 47 and 48 was higher (74, 72), but Period 49 returned to 44. I will use the recent regime (last 19 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the sustained recovery from the earlier trough. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods across all recorded arrivals. With 229 units in transit and 56 on hand, the pipeline is healthy, but current volatility and recent spikes necessitate maintaining a robust base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 38-40.
