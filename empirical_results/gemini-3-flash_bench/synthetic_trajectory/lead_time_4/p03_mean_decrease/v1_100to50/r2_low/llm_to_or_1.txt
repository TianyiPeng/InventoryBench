Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows mean = 109 and std \u2248 13.9. Since current on-hand and in-transit inventory is 0, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand over the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (critical ratio) is 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)). This means the backend will aim for the median demand. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most relevant recent history while acknowledging the 4-period lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 133 units, which are in-transit; since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect them to arrive until Period 5. Consequently, we had 0 on-hand inventory and were unable to satisfy the demand of 83 units in Period 1. The historical demand data (Periods 1-5) shows a mean of 109 and a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. However, since the user prompt only lists actual 'observed' demand through Period 1 (83), I will rely on the provided training samples which suggest a higher average. I'll use the promised lead time (L=4) for now as there is no evidence to suggest a deviation yet. To cover the risk of stockouts during the lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 periods), I will use the 'default' calculation which considers the mean and standard deviation of all available samples to establish a base stock level.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (133 units) and Period 2 (133 units) are currently 'In-transit' (Total: 266). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start message. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and because arrivals have not yet started, we are experiencing stockouts (sold=0 vs demand=83 and 108). The demand samples provided (P1-P5) show a mean of 109 units (118, 124, 116, 96, 91). I will use the mean of all 5 historical samples to set the demand forecast. Since no deliveries have concluded yet, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full available demand history provided in the prompt.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (133 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 6 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 387 units in transit (133 from P1, 133 from P2, 121 from P3). Historical demand for the first 3 periods reflects a mean of ~100 units (83, 108, 107). Including the pre-game samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91), the overall average is approximately 105.3. Since we have not yet observed any arrivals, we cannot infer a change in lead time. I will use 'default' for lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=8 (the sum of known samples + game history) to capture the current demand mean. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand while accounting for the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), which naturally results in a lower safety stock (q=0.5, z*=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (133 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's resolution phase. As of the start of Period 5, we have seen no arrivals yet, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time (the Period 5 arrival will only be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). The demand history for Periods 1-4 shows values of 83, 108, 107, and 167 (mean=116.25). Adding the additional sample provided in the prompt (Period 5: 91), the mean for the 5 samples is 109. Since on-hand is 0 and we have a pipeline of 516 units, we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for the lead time (L=4) plus the review period (1). Total periods covered should be 5. Using the default lead time (4) and calculated demand statistics for all 5 samples provides a stable baseline for the OR backend until we confirm the actual lead time and see if the P4 demand spike (167) was an outlier or a trend shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (11 units) because of the initial 4-period wait where no stock was available to satisfy demand. Historical demand for periods 1-5 was [83, 108, 107, 167, 122], with an average of 117.4. There was a notable spike in Period 4 (167), but Period 5 (122) returned closer to the previous mean. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent history including the spike, ensuring the pipeline (429 units in transit) is balanced against the lead-time demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived at P5 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable with a slight downward trend in the last two periods (122 to 73). The average demand over the 6 recorded periods is 110. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 71 units, and there are 443 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). The backend uses a base-stock policy. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full history while acknowledging current variance, and 'default' for lead time and sigma since the lead time is stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data from Period 5, 6, and 7 confirms that the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand history shows values: 83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73, 140. The average demand is approximately 114.28. Given L=4, the base stock targets the window of L+1 = 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 52 and in-transit is 358 (total 410). Demand has been relatively stable around 114, so a 5-period requirement is ~571 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full observed demand history while reacting to the established lead time precision.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the promised lead time (L=4) is consistent with observations from Period 5 through 8 (orders from P1-P4 arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 76, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 391, which includes orders from P5 (46), P6 (147), P7 (36), and P8 (162). Demand has shown significant variability (range: 73-167) without a clear trend or seasonal shift yet visible in the date labels (Period_X). The average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 113 units. Using a base-stock policy where target inventory = (L+1) * mean_demand = 5 * 113 = 565. Currently, On-hand + In-transit = 467. The OR backend will order to reach the calculated base stock. Given the high volatility (std dev ~30), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full recent history since start, as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 9 periods has been somewhat volatile (ranging from 73 to 167) but averages around 116 units per period. The inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) after Period 9 demand exceeded available stock, although 444 units are in transit. Specifically, an order of 147 units placed in Period 6 is expected to arrive during Period 10 resolution. For the OR parameters, I am using the 'calculate' method for Lead Time since it is consistently 4. For demand (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full observed demand history while allowing for recent variability. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using 'recent_N' with N=9 to ensure a robust safety stock buffer given the recent stockout and demand spikes. These settings aim to restore inventory levels to meet demand while maintaining the target service level dictated by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (z* = 0).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as verified by arrivals in Periods 5 through 10. The current pipeline (in-transit) is 435 units, consisting of orders from Period 7 (36), 8 (162), 9 (99), and 10 (138). These are expected to arrive in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14 respectively. Historical demand over the last 10 periods (83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73, 140, 105, 142, 146) has a mean of 119.3 and a standard deviation of approximately 28.9. There is no clear shift in demand regime yet, although recent demand (P9-P10) is slightly higher than average. With Profit=HoldingCost=$1.0, the target service level is 50% (base stock \u2248 mean demand over lead time + review period). I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the full history of 10 samples to ensure stable coverage for the (L+1)=5 period window.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 1 through Period 7. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 11 where demand (77) exceeded available inventory (37). Historical demand exhibits moderate volatility without a clear trend; the mean demand across the first 11 periods is approximately 115 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reinforce the consistent 4-period observation. For demand forecasting, I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the overall historical average (approx. 115 per period), ensuring the base stock level (target pipeline) covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. This approach balances the need to recover from the recent stockout while respecting the high holding cost which equals the unit profit, keeping safety stock levels conservative.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Historical demand for the first 12 periods averaged 112.67 units (samples: 83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73, 140, 105, 142, 146, 77, 82). While there is some fluctuation, there is no definitive regime shift evidence yet; demand seems to oscillate around the 110-120 range. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all arrivals to date (P5 through P12). Stockouts occurred in Period 9 and Period 11 due to low on-hand inventory when demand spiked or arrivals were small, but current on-hand is 80 and in-transit is 416 (representing orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will use all available history since the start of the game to smooth out the variance observed in recent periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (all arrivals from Period 1 to 9 arrived exactly after 4 periods). The demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 110 units over the 13 concluded periods (Sum=1443, Mean=111). However, the recent 5 periods (P9-P13) show a slightly lower mean (approx. 107.6) and high variance. The current inventory position is: On-hand = 88, In-transit = 385 (from orders in P10, P11, P12, P13). Since L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 13 samples captures the general demand volume while smoothing out the stockouts seen in Periods 9 and 11. mu_hat will be set using the last 13 samples to provide a stable forecast of (5 * 111) units, and sigma_hat will use the same window to capture the observed volatility (std ~ 30). This balances the high holding cost ($1.0) against the lost profit ($1.0) at a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend assumes by default when profit = holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a mean around 110 units. Examining the last 5 periods (P10-P14), demand has been slightly lower (83.6 avg) compared to the preceding 5 periods (P5-P9: 116.4 avg), suggesting a potential minor downward shift or higher volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 154 units with 329 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend service level target is 50%, roughly targeting the median demand over the protection interval. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand level while smoothing out recent volatility, and 'calculate' for lead time since the promised lead time of 4 is consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-95.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 16. Analyzing the lead time history from the 'conclude' messages (Periods 5 through 15), the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Therefore, L is set to default. For demand (mu_hat), the demand across the first 15 periods shows fluctuations but no clear sustained regime shift. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (Periods 6-15) is approximately 104 units, while the overall mean is approximately 110 units. Given the recent variability (ranging from 72 to 146 in the last 10 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the last 10 samples to capture the most recent volatility and average demand, helping the OR backend adjust the base stock level for the next 5 periods (L+1). With an on-hand inventory of 205 and in-transit of 210, the pipeline is relatively full, so the OR backend should naturally moderate the order size.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 17. Looking at the history (Periods 1-16), demand (including lost sales) has fluctuated between 72 and 167. The mean demand over the last 16 periods is approximately 110.8. However, there appears to be a slight downward shift in demand volatility or mean in the most recent 5 periods (mean ~87.4) compared to earlier. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (arriving 4 periods after the order). Currently, on-hand inventory is 141 and in-transit is 296 (orders from P13, P14, P15, P16). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 437. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean demand of ~111, expected demand over 5 periods is ~555. Since 437 < 555, the OR engine likely needs to order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the more recent demand profile while maintaining enough history for stability, as there isn't enough evidence for a sustained regime shift yet.

LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 142, and there are 315 units in-transit. Based on historical data from periods P1 to P17, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Recent demand (last 5 periods: 91, 72, 110, 82, 67) has shown a slight downward trend compared to the overall average (~104), with an average of 84.4 in that block. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 10 samples to capture this softening demand while remaining robust against the higher variance seen earlier (e.g., P4). L is set to calculate as the lead time is stable at 4. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect the current volatility profile.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a noticeable decline and stabilization in the most recent periods. From P1 to P11, the average demand was approximately 116 units, but from P12 to P18, the average has dropped to approximately 79 units (a decrease of ~32%). I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand regime. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised, confirmed by every arrival from P5 to P18. On-hand inventory is healthy at 154 units, and with 263 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18), the pipeline is currently well-stocked for the current demand level. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: average demand decreased from ~116 to ~79 (-32%) over the last 7 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 12. Since Period 12, the average demand has been approximately 78.1 units per period (P12-P19: 82, 91, 72, 110, 82, 67, 70, 49). To capture this lower demand trend while maintaining responsiveness to recent fluctuations, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time has remained consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the carry-over insight and multiple arrivals), so I will use 'default' for L. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%, aiming for the median demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1=5) to minimize total cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained demand regime shift that began around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, the average demand was approximately 116 units, but over the last 9 periods (P12-P20), the average dropped to approximately 74 units (specifically: 82, 91, 72, 110, 82, 67, 70, 49, 46). The most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) show even lower demand averaging 55 units. Given the transition, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of this lower-demand regime while filtering out the earlier high-demand noise. The lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages (P5 through P20), so I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize these observations. Currently, on-hand inventory is 205 and in-transit is 139, suggesting the system is well-stocked for the current demand level, which my parameters will reflect to the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~116 to ~74 (-36%) over the last 9 periods; recent volatility has also decreased.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, mean demand was approximately 116 units. From Period 12 to 21, the average demand has dropped to approximately 69.9 units, with the most recent 5 periods (Periods 17-21) averaging even lower at 54.4 units. This indicates a sustained decline that must be reflected in mu_hat to avoid excessive holding costs, especially since the holding cost ($1.0) is equal to the profit ($1.0), requiring a 50% service level target (z*=0). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With 252 units on-hand and 80 in-transit relative to a low demand trend, the inventory level is high. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period 11 regime while maintaining enough samples for a stable estimate of the lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 solidified: average demand decreased from ~116 to ~70 (-40%) over the last 10 periods; the most recent 5 periods average ~54.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-180.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting around Period 12. Since then, demand has trended even lower, with the last 5 periods (P18-P22) averaging approximately 45 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high (231 units) relative to this new demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should roughly equivalent to the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). With current demand around 45, the required base stock is ~225. Since on-hand (231) + in-transit (73) = 304, which is well above 225, the OR backend will correctly minimize new orders. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the post-shift average (P12-P22) which is approximately 67, ensuring the model gradually adjusts to the even lower very-recent demand while remaining responsive to the shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed and deepening: average demand for P12-P22 is ~67, but the most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) average has dropped further to ~45.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting around Period 12. Initially averaging ~116, the mean demand from P12-P23 has dropped to ~65, with an even more pronounced recent decline to ~46 over the last five periods (P19-P23). On-hand inventory is currently high (188 units) compared to this low-demand environment. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P18 order arrived P22). The order from Period 19 was 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' appears in Period 23 conclude message. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, implying base stock target at the median), I am using N=5 for the recent demand regime to capture the most recent local average (~46). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility observed in this low-demand period, which prevents the OR backend from over-ordering based on the higher variance of the earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Average demand for P19-P23 has stabilized at ~46 units, much lower than the P12-P18 period (~79). High on-hand inventory (188) is sufficient for ~4 periods of current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-144.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 19. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is approximately 43.7 units (49, 46, 40, 51, 43, 33). This confirms the regime shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Total pipeline inventory is 270 (177 on-hand + 93 in-transit). Given the current demand average, the on-hand inventory alone (177) covers roughly 4 periods, which is equal to the lead time. In-transit units include P21 (28), P22 (23), and P23 (42). Note that the order from P19 was 0, which explains the 'arrived=0' in P23 conclude. The P20 order (22) arrived in P24 conclude. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to reflect this lower demand regime and prevent further overstocking since the holding cost ($1) equals the profit ($1), making excess inventory very costly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 19-24 average demand is 43.7 units, a ~62% decrease from the initial P1-P11 average (~116). High on-hand inventory (177) relative to new demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-139.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 19. The mean demand for the most recent 7 periods (P19-P25) is approximately 40.7 units, a stark contrast to the initial average of ~116. Current on-hand inventory is 172 units, which is enough to cover over 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Combining on-hand and in-transit (65 units), the total pipeline is 237 units, which is very high relative to the target base stock for a (L+1)=5 period horizon. To minimize holding costs while the backend processes the excess inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this low-demand regime. This will result in a lower base stock calculation, preventing the system from ordering more units until the current surplus is depleted. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 19-25 average demand is 40.7 units, a ~65% decrease from the initial P1-P11 average (~116). Current inventory levels (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceed target base stock for this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-97.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a much lower regime. Average demand for the last 8 periods (P19-P26) is approximately 41.6 units (49, 46, 40, 51, 43, 33, 33, 49), significantly lower than the historical average. Current on-hand inventory (146) is extremely high compared to this new demand level, covering nearly 3.5 periods of demand by itself. Pipeline inventory is 42 units (ordered Period 23, expected Period 27/28), which will further increase the surplus. The holding cost ($1.0) equals the unit profit ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, which targets a base stock roughly at the median of demand over the protection interval (L+1=5 periods). With current on-hand + in-transit totaling 188 units, while 5 periods of demand is only ~208 units, the system is nearly at the target base stock for the new regime. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the stabilized low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as 4 periods remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 19-26 average demand is 41.6 units, a ~64% decrease from the initial P1-P11 average (~116).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting around Period 19. Over the last 9 periods (P19-P27), the average demand is approximately 44.2 units, a significant drop from the early period average (~116). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current inventory levels are high: On-hand inventory is 134 units and In-transit is 27 units (total 161). Given the current demand (avg ~44), our pipeline is sufficient to cover nearly 4 periods of demand without further ordering. The OR backend's target base stock (calculated as (1+L) * mu) for a 4-period lead time and ~44 unit demand would be roughly 220 units. Since on-hand + in-transit is 161, the system will continue to bleed down the excess inventory slowly to avoid holding costs (which are equal to profit). I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the stable observed 4-period delivery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-72.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a much lower regime. Since Period 19, demand has consistently averaged approximately 41.25 units (mean of P19-P28: 49, 46, 40, 51, 43, 33, 33, 49, 54, 31). This is a significant decrease from the initial periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 103 units, which alone covers approximately 2.5 periods of the current average demand. In-transit inventory is 84 units (ordered P24-P28), which brings the pipeline total to 187. I will use the recent 10-period window (P19-P28) for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this lower regime effectively while ensuring the service level stays appropriate for the profit/holding ratio. The backend logic will automatically adjust order quantities based on the current high inventory levels and this revised demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift solidified: Period 19-28 average demand is 41.25 units, representing a 64% decrease from initial levels. Recent demand (P24-P28) is even lower, averaging 40.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-regime phase starting around Period 19. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P19-P29) is approximately 44 units, contrasting sharply with the early-game average of ~116. While there was a shipment from Period 19 that was lost (ordered 0, effectively nothing), the pipeline currently consists of 112 units (from orders in P27, P28, P29). On-hand inventory is 47, which covers about 1 period of current demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent successful arrivals (P27 conclude). I will continue using recent_N (N=11) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the ~44 units/period demand level while accounting for the ~5 periods of lead time and review risk. The high pipeline inventory relative to current demand means the OR backend will likely order very little or nothing until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 fully stabilized: Average demand P19-P29 is 44.1 units (62% reduction from P1-P11). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting around Period 19. Over the last 12 periods (P19-P30), average demand has been approximately 42.3 units, down significantly from the initial average of ~116. Recent demand (P24-P30) is slightly lower at 40.0 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 25 units with 171 units in-transit. Based on a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Total demand for 5 periods is ~210 units. Our total pipeline (25 + 171 = 196) is slightly below this replenishment target. However, significant arrivals (from orders placed P27-P30 totaling 171 units) are expected to start arriving in Period 31 or 32. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat (covering the stable lower regime since P19) and recent_N of 12 for sigma_hat to reflect the reduced volatility observed in this period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P19-P31) has stabilized around a mean of ~45 units, despite a spike to 70 in P31 that depleted on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The 'lost' orders from periods 24-26 (placed as 0 units) and the lack of arrivals from orders placed in P28-P30 (which are still in-transit and expected in P32-P34) have left current on-hand inventory at 0. With 160 units in-transit (P28: 57, P29: 28, P30: 59, P31: 16), the pipeline is sufficient to cover the next 4 periods of demand (~45 * 4 = 180). However, the zero on-hand status requires the OR backend to recalculate the necessary base stock to ensure the next arrivals satisfy imminent demand. I will use recent_N=13 for demand (P19-P31) to capture the current lower-demand regime while including the recent spike to maintain a safe service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike noted in Period 31 (70 units), but the overall Period 19-31 regime remains significantly lower than initial levels (mean ~44). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shifted around Period 19 to a lower mean. Looking at the regime since Period 19 (P19-P32), the average demand is approximately 45.9 units. The spike in Period 31 (70 units) appears to be an outlier or part of local volatility rather than a new upward trend, as Period 32 returned to 46 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P27 arrived at P31, P28 arrived at P32). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (11), but there are 165 units in-transit: orders from P29 (28), P30 (59), P31 (16), and P32 (62). The order from P29 is expected to arrive during Period 33 (visible P34 start). However, since current on-hand is low and we must cover demand until the larger P30 shipment arrives, I am using recent_N (N=14, covering the low-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower demand and its volatility while maintaining the lead time at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P19-P32 remains stable with a mean of ~46 units, despite a one-period spike in P31.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 19, settling into a much lower average of approximately 45 units compared to the initial 116. Specifically, the average demand from Period 19 to Period 33 is 44.5 units (std dev ~12.5). Using N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this stable, lower-demand regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals in the history, most recently in Period 33). Pipeline inventory (184) and current on-hand (8) aggregate to 192 units. At a forecast of ~45 units/period, this covers roughly 4.2 periods of demand, which aligns with the total lead-time protection (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is low (8), but a significant shipment (59 units ordered in P30) is expected to arrive this period (P34) because the lead time is 4. I will maintain the recent_N method to ensure the OR backend tracks the current demand regime properly.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 19 at a significantly lower level (mean ~45 units). Recent demand (P19-P34) averages 43.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in P27, P28, P29, and P30. Currently, on-hand inventory is 42 units and in-transit is 151 units (from orders in P31, P32, P33, P34). The total pipeline plus on-hand (193 units) already covers over 4 periods of future demand at the current regime. Setting mu_hat using the last 16 periods (N=16) captures the new regime effectively, and sigma_hat is adjusted to the same window to reflect current volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the lower state established around Period 19. Average demand for the most recent 17 periods (P19-P35) is approximately 43.6 units, while the very recent 5-period average (P31-P35) is 45.4 units, showing stability despite periodic fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P31 order arriving at P35 conclude). Current on-hand inventory is low (3 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 155 units. Given that Period 32 (62 units), Period 33 (47 units), and Period 34 (26 units) orders are in transit and expected to arrive in the next 1-3 periods, the current strategy is to maintain the base stock according to the recent lower demand levels. I will use N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full extent of the current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift around Period 19, stabilizing at a much lower mean compared to the initial periods. Over the last 18 periods (P19-P36), the mean demand is approximately 43.6 units per period. Recently (last 10 periods), the mean is slightly higher at 45.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 16.6 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple delivery cycles (P31, P32, P33, P34, P35, P36 all showed lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (4 units), but in-transit inventory is high (151 units). The OR engine needs to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current state of the lower-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility (including the occasional spikes like Period 31 and Period 36).

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 19. Calculating the average demand from Period 19 through Period 37, the mean is approximately 45.4 units per period. The standard deviation in this same window is approximately 14.4 units. We are currently in Period 38 with 0 units on-hand and 175 units in-transit. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, meaning we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The target base stock for this regime (considering the high service level dictated by the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, roughly q=0.5 or z=0) should be around 5 * 45 = 225 units. Since we have 175 in-transit, we need to continue ordering to recover from the current stockout and reach the target pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 to capture the entirety of this stabilized lower-demand regime (P19-P37) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19 to 37 is stable with a mean of ~45.4 units and std dev of ~14.4, representing a permanent shift from the initial high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we start with 0 On-hand inventory and 200 units in-transit. The game history shows that the order from Period 35 (20 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 39 (Lead Time = 4), followed by Period 36's order (58 units) in Period 40. While lead time has been consistent at 4 periods, recent demand (P35-P38) has spiked significantly, averaging 65.5 units compared to the previously established regime average of ~45. This spike resulted in 0 ending on-hand inventory for the last two periods, combined with stockouts. To prevent further lost sales, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture this upward movement (covering P32-P38) while maintaining stability. The L=4 lead time remains the most accurate based on consistent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 35: the 4-period average (P35-P38) is 65.5, up from the ~45 average observed between P19-P34. This shift has led to consecutive periods (P37, P38) of stockouts.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of inventory depletion due to a recent increase in demand and stockouts. Period 39 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand over the last 5 periods (P35-P39) has averaged 61.2 units (55, 61, 63, 83, 44), which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (avg ~44). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Orders from P36 (58 units), P37 (71 units), P38 (51 units), and P39 (60 units) are in-transit, totaling 240 units. Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing a higher demand regime, I need to adjust mu_hat using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current upward trend in demand while maintaining a standard lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Since Period 35, demand has increased from an average of ~44 to ~61 units (+38%), leading to recurring stockouts from Period 37-39. Inventory pipeline is currently full (240 units) to compensate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 35, increasing from an average of ~44 to ~61.5 units (P35-P40). This shift, combined with lead time constraints, has resulted in stockouts from Period 37 to Period 40. Given the profit and holding costs are both $1.0/unit, the target service level is 50%, but since we are recovering from stockouts and demand is more volatile, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use the most recent 6 samples (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current pipeline of 248 units is substantial and will begin arriving this period, which should resolve the stockout situation provided the parameters set a sufficiently high target.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 35. The average demand from Period_35 to Period_41 is approximately 58 units (samples: 55, 61, 63, 83, 44, 63, 36). This is a significant increase from the previous low-demand regime (avg ~44). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 35, and there are 237 units in transit. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the current mean (~58) and the observed volatility. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this new regime, and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat captures the increased uncertainty. These parameters will help the OR engine replenish sufficient units to avoid the stockouts seen between Periods 37-40 while balancing the holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized since Period 35: average demand increased from ~44 to ~58 (+32%) with higher volatility (std dev ~15).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 35. Since then (P35-P42), mean demand has increased to approximately 58.0 units with a standard deviation of 14.5, compared to the previous regime's mean of ~45. This shift caused multiple stockouts between Periods 37-40. Currently, on-hand inventory is 27 units, and the pipeline is significant (204 units) due to aggressive ordering to recover from stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent 'conclude' messages (P41 and P42 arrivals both had lead_time=4). I will use N=8 for 'recent_N' to capture the new demand regime (P35-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=calculate will maintain the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 35, increasing from an average of ~44 to ~55.6 units (calculated from P35-P43: 55, 61, 63, 83, 44, 63, 36, 59, 48). This shift initially caused stockouts because the pipeline and on-hand inventory were adjusted for the previous lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of orders from P37, P38, and P39 exactly 4 periods later. The current on-hand inventory is 39 units, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 203 units. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this latest demand regime (P35-P43). This will allow the OR backend to set the base stock based on the higher mean and volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 35: mean demand increased to ~55.6 units (from ~44), with higher volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 35. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), demand has averaged approximately 55.4 units per period, with a standard deviation of roughly 12.6. This is a significant increase from the previous quiet period (P19-P34) where mean demand was ~44, but remains lower than the initial high-demand phase (P1-P11). The system has recently recovered from stockouts caused by this shift, and the current inventory position (On-hand: 63, In-transit: 180) is better aligned with this demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stable 'new normal' regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), providing the OR backend with the most relevant local statistics for the remaining 5 periods of the game.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 35 has stabilized at a higher level compared to the Period 19-34 period. Specifically, for the last 11 periods (P35-P45), the mean demand is approximately 55.5 units (std dev ~12.2). The current on-hand inventory is 66 units, with 154 units in transit (P42: 18, P43: 59, P44: 43, P45: 34). These arrivals are scheduled for Periods 46, 47, 48, and 49 respectively. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed history. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stabilized post-Period 35 regime, which accounts for the most recent shifts while excluding the historical low-demand period (P19-P34) and the early high-demand period (P1-P11). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=11 to reflect current volatility levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 35 from an average of ~44 to ~55-60 units. This higher demand level has stabilized over the last 12 periods (P35-P46). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 46 (ordered P42). On-hand inventory is currently 69, with an in-transit pipeline of 194. Together, these 263 units cover approximately 4.8 periods of recent average demand (~55 units/period). Since the target coverage (L+1) is 5 periods, and we are currently at Period 47 (near the game end at P50), maintaining this regime's parameters is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the current regime since Period 35, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=12 to reflect the current elevated volatility (std dev ~17.5 in this period). For L, I retain 'calculate' as lead times have been perfectly stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 35 maintains a higher mean of ~54.8 units compared to the previous ~44 units, with higher variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 35 from an average of ~44 to ~55 units. Over the last 13 periods (P35-P47), the average demand is 53.77 units with a standard deviation of 17.65. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P43 order arriving in P47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 54 and in-transit is 135 (orders from P44, P45, P46). The game is approaching its conclusion (Period 48 of 50). Since the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is after the game ends. Therefore, the primary goal now is to manage the existing pipeline and on-hand inventory rather than placing large new orders that won't arrive in time. However, to maintain the logic of the OR backend for the remaining periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current regime (N=13) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current needs, while letting the pipeline naturally cover the final steps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a new regime since Period 35. Over the last 14 periods (P35-P48), the average demand is 54.8 units, which is significantly higher than the ~44 units seen in the previous low-demand regime (P19-P34). Recent demand has shown some volatility, with the last two periods (P47, P48) hitting 74 and 72 units respectively. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the P44 order arriving in P48 (lead time 4). My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). With on-hand inventory at 25 and in-transit at 173 (total 198), and a target mean demand for the period of (1+4)*55 = 275, the current pipeline is slightly lean for the recent high-demand peaks. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the outdated historical data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $29.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are managing a demand regime that shifted around Period 35, moving from an average of ~44 to approximately ~54.3 units (calculated from P35-P49). The recent demand in P47-P48 was higher (74, 72), followed by a lower 44 in P49, indicating sustained volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 15 units, with 217 units in-transit. The in-transit pipeline is substantial because orders from P46 (58), P47 (0), P48 (81), and P49 (78) are all outstanding. Our target base stock (calculated as (L+1)*mean + z*sigma*sqrt(L+1)) for this regime (mean ~54.3, std ~16.5, L=4) is approximately 390 units. Total pipeline (15 + 217 = 232) is currently below this target. I will use recent_N (N=15) for demand and sigma to capture the post-P35 regime characteristics and allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate order to reach the base stock level while respecting the safety cap.
