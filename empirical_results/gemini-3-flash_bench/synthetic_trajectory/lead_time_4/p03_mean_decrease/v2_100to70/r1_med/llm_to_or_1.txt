Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. I am managing 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. On-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0. I have historical demand data for the first 5 periods (61, 107, 84, 144, 69), with a mean of 93 and a standard deviation of approximately 33. Given the Lead Time (L) of 4, the target window is (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat will cause the OR engine to use all available historical samples to set the base stock level. Since there is no actual arrival data yet, I will rely on the promised lead time and the initial demand distribution to bootstrap the inventory position.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 149 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect arrivals until the 'Period 4 conclude' message (at the start of Period 5). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory, so demand in Period 1 (59 units) resulted in lost sales. Total demand observed so far (including pre-game samples) is [61, 107, 84, 144, 69, 59]. The mean demand is approximately 87.3. Given the Lead Time L=4, the pipeline inventory must cover (L+1) = 5 periods. The current in-transit (149) is slightly low relative to 5 periods of average demand (~436). I will use 'default' for L to stick with the promised 4 periods, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline using all available samples until a clearer trend emerges.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (Period 1) has a promised lead time of 4 periods and is not expected to arrive until Period 5. Consequently, all demand in Periods 1 and 2 (59 and 75 units respectively) was lost (sold=0). The current in-transit pipeline is 291 units (orders from P1 and P2). The mean demand over the first 5 samples provided in the prompt is 93.0, though the actual observed demand in P1 and P2 was 59 and 75. Since we only have 2 periods of runtime data and they are lower than the historical sample average, I will rely on 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the available history and the seed data properly. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) via the 'default' method until we observe actual arrivals to confirm any drift.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have not arrived yet, which is expected as they should arrive during Period 5 (L=4 means arrival in N+L). Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost all demand so far (total demand P1-P3 = 265 units). The total in-transit units (354) match the orders placed in Periods 1-3 (149+142+63). Demand history shows 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 (though Period 4 and 5 data in the prompt seems to be 'future' context relative to the 'Current Status' which says Period 4). Based on the 5 samples provided (Avg=93, Std=34), and the promised lead time L=4, I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat as there is no evidence yet to deviate from the historical average or lead time expectations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first four periods is 59, 75, 131, and 57 (average ~80.5). Starting with 0 on-hand inventory, we have seen no arrivals yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (149 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, all 499 units ordered in Periods 1-4 are 'in-transit'. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for Period 5 plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). The mean demand is approx 80.5 per period. (1+4)*80.5 = 402.5. With 499 units already in the pipeline, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order this period to avoid overstocking, which is appropriate as the pipeline already exceeds the estimated base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. Looking at the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived at the end of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is currently 350 units (orders from P2, P3, and P4), and on-hand inventory is 40. Historical demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69 from the prompt; and 59, 75, 131, 57, 109 from history) show a mean of approximately 89.9. Since there is no clear seasonal shift yet and lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (the length of the observed game history) to capture the most relevant recent demand volatility and mean.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Demand for the first 6 periods has been somewhat volatile (59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127), with an average of approximately 93 units per period. I will use the default lead time (4) as it is consistent with observations. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full available history, as we are still in the early stages and no clear regime shift is yet apparent. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' for N=6 to estimate volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~465 units). Current inventory position (on-hand 55 + in-transit 311 = 366) suggests an order will be triggered to reach the target service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows that orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly in 4 periods (Period 5, 6, and 7 respectively). Therefore, the lead time L remains stable at 4. Demand history for the first 8 samples (including pre-game) is: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 (pre-game) and 59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127, 46 (game history). The mean of all 12 samples is ~89 units/period. There is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift yet, though demand varies between 46 and 144. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data (12 samples) to calculate the base stock. This covers the (L+1) = 5 period risk window. Pipeline inventory is currently 397 (Orders from P4, P6, P7), and on-hand is 72. The OR backend will calculate the order based on these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Periods 5-8 confirm an actual lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). The demand for chips(Regular) shows significant variability over the last 8 periods (ranging from 46 to 131), with an average around 90. Given L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current on-hand is 102 and in-transit is 291 (total pipeline = 393). Order from P6 (103 units) is expected to arrive in P10, P7 (149 units) in P11, and P8 (39 units) in P12. Using recent history (last 5-8 periods) to estimate demand reflects the current regime best. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the full range of observed demand since the game started. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average demand and the observed volatility to maintain a high service level without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed at 4 periods (matches promised).

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 1-4 arriving in Periods 5-8. Period 9 showed 0 arrivals, which is expected since no order was placed in Period 5. The current on-hand inventory is low (11 units), but a large in-transit pipeline (412 units) exists from orders placed in Periods 6-9. Historical demand over 9 periods shows a mean of 90 units and a standard deviation of 31.8. Since there is no clear evidence of a shift in demand regime (demand fluctuates between 46 and 131), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full recent history for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the order from Period 6 arrived in Period 10, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4, which matches the promised lead time. However, there is a missing shipment: the order from Period 5 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival at Period 9, but more importantly, no order was placed in Period 5, causing the inventory to dip significantly. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (13 units). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 92.5 units over the last 10 periods. The pipeline inventory is healthy (397 units), representing roughly 4 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the stable demand regime observed since the start, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P10 and P11). Demand over the last 11 periods has shown some variability but generally hovers around a mean of ~93 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P7-P11) have a mean demand of 91.4 units. Since on-hand inventory is 58 and in-transit is 351, the pipeline is relatively full relative to the expected demand of (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation will better capture the current volatility while acknowledging the lead time is stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is critically low (5 units), but there are 411 units in-transit. Based on historical data from periods 5-12, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). The order from Period 9 (121 units), which was expected to arrive in Period 13, has not arrived yet as arrivals happen after the decision phase; it should be visible in the next period's concluding message. To stabilize the inventory, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 8 samples (Periods 5-12) reflect a stabilized demand regime with a mean of ~98.1 units per period, which is higher and less volatile than the initial 4-period noise. I will use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized pattern while ignoring the initial empty-stock startup phase. The OR backend will use these values to manage the base stock level required for the L+1 period lead-time horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 5: mean ~98 units, significantly less volatile than startup periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a stable demand regime and lead-time environment. Demand since Period 5 has stabilized around a mean of approximately 101 units per period (samples P5-P13: 109, 127, 46, 115, 91, 101, 104, 92, 122). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13 arrivals all confirm L=4). On-hand inventory is very low at 4 units, but significant stock is in-transit (411 units). The OR backend calculation for base_stock targets a service level of 80% (4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N to emphasize the stable post-startup regime (N=9 for demand, covering Periods 5-13) and keep lead time at default (4). This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate rather than the volatile startup phase.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 10 order. The current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units), meaning we are heavily dependent on incoming shipments. Since Period 5, the demand has entered a more stable regime. The mean demand from Period 5 to Period 14 (10 samples) is approximately 100.2 units with a standard deviation of 21.0. Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level (approximately 500 units) that accounts for the current demand mean and volatility while considering the 457 units already in transit.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 5, currently averaging ~100 units per period (sample mean Periods 5-15 is 99.1). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory on-hand is low (21 units) following Period 15, and an order of 99 units placed in Period 12 is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 16. The total pipeline inventory is high (430 units), which covers approximately 4.3 periods of average demand. To maintain the target service level given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stable regime starting from Period 5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 17. Looking at the history, demand has transitioned from a volatile start to a more stable regime starting around Period 5. The mean demand from Period 5 to 16 is approximately 94.7 units with a standard deviation of about 26.5. The actual lead time L has consistently remained at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. In-transit inventory stands at 414 units, corresponding to orders placed in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16 (121+134+76+83), all of which are expected to arrive within the next 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 74 units. To maintain an appropriate service level while accounting for recent demand stability, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 (covering the Period 5-16 regime). This setting for mu_hat will cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to capture the lower volatility observed in this regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the on-hand inventory is 133 units, with 324 units in-transit. A review of the history shows that the actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand starting from Period 5 has stabilized around a mean of approximately 93 units per period (Period 5-17 average: 92.2), with significantly lower volatility than the initial startup phase. Recent demand in Periods 16 and 17 (46 and 62 units respectively) has been lower than the average, but not yet long enough to confirm a new downward regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 5, covering the (L+1)=5 period lead time window. sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the reduced variance in this period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 19. Inventory on-hand is 183 units with 240 units in transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders (P1 through P14). Demand from Period 5 onwards has stabilized. Analyzing the last 14 samples (P5 to P18), the average demand is approximately 91.3 units per period. The recent demand (P16-P18) has been slightly lower (46, 62, 84), but 91 remains a robust baseline for this regime. I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize the consistent historical lead time evidence.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis: The demand regime remains stable. From Period 5 to Period 19, mean demand is approximately 91.6 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Currently, we have 178 units on hand and 244 units in transit (expected arrivals from Period 16-19 orders). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 422 units. Using N=15 for recent demand captures the stable regime since Period 5. With L=4, the base stock targets coverage for (4+1)=5 periods. 5 * 91.6 = 458 units. The current inventory is slightly below this target, but given the holding cost of $1.0 vs $4.0 profit (critical ratio 0.8), the backend OR logic will maintain appropriate service levels. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed stability, and mu_hat/sigma_hat use recent_N=15 to focus on the post-startup demand pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 5, following an initial volatile startup phase. Since Period 13, demand has averaged approximately 82 units per period (Periods 13-20: [122, 85, 89, 46, 62, 84, 81, 73]), which is slightly lower than the 'Period 13' insight of 98 units. Lead time is reliably confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 188 and 237 units in-transit (total pipeline of 425), and a total lead-time horizon (L+1) of 5 periods, the current coverage is approximately 5.1 periods of demand (425 / 82.75). I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the stable regime from Period 5 onwards (20 periods available, but focusing on the most representative 16 periods including the current lower trend). This will help the backend normalize demand expectations and manage the current healthy pipeline without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5 to 20 shows a gradual decrease in mean to ~83 units per period compared to the earlier Period 13 estimate of 98.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the demand context remains stable within the regime identified around Period 5. Recent data from Period 5 to 21 shows a mean demand of approximately 88.5 units. While 'Carry-over Insights' noted a drop to ~83 units, the most recent observation in Period 21 was 95 units, suggesting a slight uptick or variance around the mean. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by every shipment that has arrived since Period 5. The pipeline inventory (273 units) and on-hand inventory (124 units) are relatively high compared to current demand trends, so the OR backend should naturally moderate ordering. I am using recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since Period 5, which provides a more accurate forecast than the initial high-volatility startup phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $246.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a lower demand regime since Period 16. In the last 7 periods (Periods 16-22), the average demand is approximately 75 units (46, 62, 84, 81, 73, 95, 84). This is a noticeable step down from the previous equilibrium of ~98 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 90 and in-transit inventory at 318, we have a total pipeline of 408 units. Using L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand), the expected requirement at a mean of 75 units/period is roughly 375 units. The current pipeline is ample. I will set L to 4 using the default method, and use the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility accurately, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (~80% critical ratio) without overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed around Period 16: average demand decreased from ~90 to ~75 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

The demand regime shifted around Period 16, decreasing from an average of ~90 units to ~78 units (mean of Period 16-23 is 78.25). The most recent demand (Period 23) was 101, but the overall trend since Period 16 remains lower than the early game. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23 (4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is 69, with 238 units in-transit (orders from Periods 20, 21, and 22). To maintain a service level appropriate for the profit/holding ratio (q = 0.8), I am using a recent_N strategy for both demand and lead time to capture the lower stabilization. N=8 (Period 16 to 23) is used for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the current regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. In Period 23, a shift was identified starting around Period 16, with demand decreasing from ~90 to ~75 units. Reviewing the most recent demand samples (Periods 19-24: 81, 73, 95, 84, 101, 59), the mean of the last 6 samples is 82.17. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 86 and in-transit units at 270 (summing to 356), total inventory is already high relative to the projected (L+1) demand (approx 5 * 82 = 410). I will use a N=10 period window to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory levels settle appropriately without over-ordering, while maintaining the default lead time method as it matches the observed reality.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 80 units since Period 16. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 76.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. The actual lead time remains consistently aligned with the promised lead time of 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock calculation needs to cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. Current on-hand inventory is 73 and in-transit is 267, totaling 340 units. Since the pipeline covers nearly 4.5 periods of demand at the current average rate, the OR backend will decide based on the parameters provided to maintain optimal service levels. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the most relevant demand regime from Period 16 onwards.

Daily Reward (R_t): $362.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 83.5 units per period over the last 11 periods (P16-P26), showing less volatility and a lower average compared to the early game. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. With 62 units on-hand and 247 units in-transit (covering orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26), the pipeline is healthy. I am selecting recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this current stable regime while ignoring the higher-demand startup phase. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects current demand trends, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 26 confirmed stable with a mean of ~83.5 units/period and lower standard deviation than initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, the order from Period 23 (ordered units = 0) resulted in an arrival of 0, leaving on-hand inventory at 0 after a demand of 63. This stockout was expected because no order was placed in Period 23. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 357 units, consisting of orders from Periods 24, 25, 26, and 27. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The demand regime from Period 16 to 27 suggests a mean of approximately 81.75 units per period (N=12). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 captures this stable demand period while discounting earlier high-volatility startup data. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=12 to reflect the current lower volatility. This strategy aims to replenish inventory to cover the lead time + review period (5 periods) without excessive holding costs, as on-hand is currently depleted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the shipment from Period 24 arrived after a 4-period lead time. However, the order from Period 23 (size 0, but technically a 'slot') did not result in an arrival, and historically, actual lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 50 units. Demand since Period 16 has averaged approximately 81.3 units per period (sum of demand P16-P28 = 1057 / 13 periods). The most recent demand (P24-P28) shows a slight decrease (average 73.2). I will use a window of the last 13 samples (N=13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable regime identified in the carry-over insights starting around Period 16. This should provide a balanced forecast for the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the lead time of 4 periods plus the review period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the demand environment remains relatively stable. Analyzing the most recent demand regime starting from roughly Period 16, the average demand is approximately 78 units per period (sample mean of P16-P29). Period 27 saw a stockout due to an order not being placed in Period 23 (ordered=0), coupled with the lead time. Lead time (L) remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 28 and 29 (both showing lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is 51 and in-transit is 302. To ensure we cover demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering data back to Period 16) to capture the current stable mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=14 to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter will use 'calculate' to rely on the consistent observed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 29 stable; mean demand approximately 78 units/period. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 78-83 units per period since Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 21-30), the average demand is 83.0 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 30 (ordered Period 26). Although the Period 23 order was for 0 units and Period 27 has not concluded yet, there are no missing shipments of concern. I will use recent_N (N=15, covering back to Period 16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the higher volatility and mean of the early stages.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation is for Period 32. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly since around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 up to Period 31 (16 samples), the mean demand is approximately 79.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Looking at the most recent 10 periods (Period 22-31), the mean is 80 units, suggesting the regime identified in the carry-over insights (mean ~78-83) remains valid. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 31 shows Period 27's order arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 56, and in-transit is 271, totaling 327. For a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using N=16 (the length of the current stable regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a robust estimate for the base stock calculation, while L=4 is the proven lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand from Period 28 to 32 has shown a slight uptick, with several observations over 90 units (105, 89, 91), contrasting with the previous regime mean of ~78 units. The mean for the last 5 periods (P28-P32) is approximately 81.2. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals from P27 and P28. I am using recent_N (N=16, from Period 17 onwards) to capture the stabilized demand profile while allowing the OR backend to weigh the recent slight increase. The pipeline (296) and on-hand (18) are currently sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time, but I will maintain the current configuration to ensure the service level remains high without excessive holding costs.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly since Period 16. Using the most recent demand data (Periods 16 to 33), the mean demand is approximately 78.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 18.2 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as promised, confirmed by the most recent arrivals (Period 33 saw the arrival of the Period 29 order). Current on-hand inventory is 31, and pipeline inventory is 354, which is quite high compared to the expected demand over the lead time (approximately 5 periods * 78.4 = 392 units). To maintain optimal service levels given a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1 (target service level ~80%), I will use recent_N to capture the current stable regime. For L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, I'll use N=18 (covering from Period 16 to 33) to ensure the OR backend utilizes the most relevant historical mean and variance for the current stabilized demand pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around the previously identified regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 34 (19 samples), the mean is approximately 78.4 units per period. The recent demand (last 5 periods) shows some fluctuation (89, 105, 37, 71, and 59, 107, 84, 144, 69 from the provided head samples) but remains within a consistent range. I am sticking with a recent_N approach for demand forecasting, using N=19 to align with the detected regime since Period 16. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (arrived units in P34 were from P30, P33 from P29, P32 from P28, and P31 from P27). However, Period 23 had zero units ordered, which has passed through the pipeline. On-hand inventory is low (18 units), but arrival of the P31 order is expected during this period (Period 35). The OR parameters are set to maintain the base stock level across the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history from Period 16 to Period 35 shows a stable regime with a mean of approximately 76 units per period. The Carry-over Insights also support a stabilization around this level. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 73 and in-transit is 304 (total pipeline 377), it roughly covers 5 periods of demand at the current average (5 * 76 = 380). I will use the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture this stable regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to allow the OR backend to set an appropriate target stock level for the remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slightly higher mean over the most recent 10-period window (Periods 27-36), averaging approximately 73 units per period, compared to the previously observed 63-65 units. Although some volatility remains (std ~23), the lead time is extremely consistent at 4 periods. My carry-over insights confirm that lead time remains stable at L=4. Given that Profit ($4.0) is much higher than Holding Cost ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q = 4/5 = 0.80) is appropriate. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples to capture this most recent stable demand regime while setting L to default (4 periods) and sigma_hat to recent_N (10) to reflect recent volatility. Current inventory (on-hand 88 + in-transit 247 = 335) is well-positioned against the expected (L+1) period demand (~365 units), suggesting the OR backend will place a moderate replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand regime from Period 27 to 36 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 73 units/period, slightly higher than the Period 30 estimate, but still significantly lower than the startup phase. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the initial periods. Analyzing the most recent stable regime from Period 27 to Period 37, the mean demand is approximately 73 units per period (sum of demands: 63, 58, 63, 91, 89, 105, 37, 71, 41, 77, 69 = 764; 764 / 11 \u2248 69.5). Looking at the very latest 10 samples (P28-P37), the mean is approximately 70.3. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend aims for a high service level (~80% quantile). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this recent stable but lower demand profile, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time is clearly 4 periods and stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows stability in the chips(Regular) SKU. Starting from Period 27, demand has settled into a lower regime compared to the early startup phase. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 38 is approximately 71.9 units per period (sum = 863 units over 12 periods). Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the most recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 38 saw the arrival of the Period 34 order). My analysis of the last 12 periods suggest a mean of 72 and a standard deviation around 20. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this stabilized demand regime since Period 27. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect the current volatility. This approach balances the need for enough units to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs from the older, higher-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 27 to 38 is stable with a mean of ~72 units/period, down from previous estimates. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 27 at a mean of approximately 72 units per period (last 13 samples: 63, 58, 63, 91, 89, 105, 37, 71, 41, 77, 69, 70, 59). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (e.g., Period 39 conclusion shows Period 35 order arriving). The inventory position is currently 326 units (102 on-hand + 224 in-transit), which covers approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate. I will maintain a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for Lead Time to reflect the historical consistency of L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 27 to 39 remains stable with a mean of ~72 units/period. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $303.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 14 periods (from Period 27 down to Period 40). Analyzing the demand samples from Period 27 onwards (63, 58, 63, 91, 89, 105, 37, 71, 41, 77, 69, 70, 59, 88), the mean demand is approximately 70.07 units per period. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (ordered Period 36, arrived Period 40) confirming this. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the OR backend will target a high service level. To maintain this while accounting for recent stability, I will use a recent_N window for both mean and standard deviation. N is set to 14 to cover the identified stable regime from Period 27. L will remain at the promised default of 4 as actuals consistently match promised.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a stable pattern since Period 27, fluctuating around a mean of approximately 72-74 units. In the most recent periods (P37-P41), demand values were 69, 70, 59, 88, and 75, averaging 72.2 units. The lead time has been exceptionally consistent at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (ordered P37, arrived P41) confirming this. Currently, on-hand inventory is 28, and there is a total pipeline inventory of 284 units (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). Since the service level target is high (Profit $4 / Holding $1 gives a critical ratio of 0.8), I will use the established stable demand regime (N=15, covering Period 27 to 41) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend maintains sufficient stock to cover the review period plus the 4-period lead time without over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for demand forecasting to capture this stability.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime which began around Period 27. From Period 27 to Period 42, the mean demand is approximately 71.9 units per period. The standard deviation in this specific range is approximately 18.2. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages. My current on-hand inventory is 34 and in-transit is 287. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (the length of the current stable regime from Period 27 to 42) to provide the OR backend with the most accurate recent demand statistics while ignoring the early startup volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 27 to 42 confirmed stable with a mean of ~72 units/period and standard deviation of ~18.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 27, maintaining a mean of approximately 72 units per period with a standard deviation of about 18. Recent demand samples (P40-P43: 88, 75, 66, 79) support this regime, averaging 77 units, which is slightly higher but consistent with the historical variance. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival in Period 43 of the order placed in Period 39. With an on-hand inventory of 18 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 288 units, we are well-covered for the lead time duration (L+1 = 5 periods). I will continue using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering Period 27 to present) to capture the stable behavior of this specific regime, ensuring the OR backend balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost effectively.

The most recent observations (Periods 40-44) show demand values of 88, 75, 66, 79, and 71, further supporting this regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the game (P45-P50), and an on-hand inventory of only 1 unit, maintaining the current stock levels is crucial to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs at the end. I will use the established regime from Period 27 (N=18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the proven lead time of 4.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 27 at a mean of approximately 72 units per period, with a standard deviation around 18. Recent demand samples from Period 41 to 45 (75, 66, 79, 71, 54) confirm this, with a five-period average of 69 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods: the order from P41 arrived exactly in P45. On-hand inventory is 42, and there is a significant pipeline of 289 units (orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45). With P50 being the final period, the OR backend's default capping logic and base-stock calculation will naturally temper ordering to avoid excess ending inventory, given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4). I will use recent_N with N=19 (Period 27 to 45) to capture the current stable demand regime while providing a robust standard deviation estimate.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 27, with a mean demand of approximately 71.5 units per period and a standard deviation of about 14.5 units based on the last 20 samples. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (Periods 47, 48, 49, 50), any order placed now (Period 47) with a lead time of 4 will arrive exactly at the arrival resolution phase of Period 51, which is after the simulation ends. Consequently, no more orders will contribute to sales before the game concludes. The current inventory position (On-hand: 58 + In-transit: 264 = 322) is more than sufficient to cover the expected total remaining demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 (approx. 72 * 4 = 288 units). Ordering more would only increase holding costs. Therefore, I am setting the base stock level via mu_hat to be covered by existing inventory to prevent further ordering.

Daily Profit: $300.00, Daily Holding Cost: $47.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable from Period 27 through Period 47, with a mean demand of approximately 71.3 units per period (sample mean of the last 21 periods). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by historical arrivals. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (Periods 48, 49, and 50), the system must manage the current on-hand inventory (47 units) and the significant pipeline inventory (256 units). Since orders placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4 = 52) due to the 4-period lead time, they will NOT arrive before the game ends at Period 50. Therefore, the OR backend's order calculation should primarily focus on not over-ordering while maintaining enough stock for the final three days. I am setting L to the default (4) and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21 (the length of the stable regime since Period 27) to provide the most accurate statistical basis for the base stock calculation, which will inherently be capped by the logic since the pipeline already likely covers the remaining demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 27, with a mean demand of approximately 71.3 units per period (calculated from Period 27 to 48). Over the last 10 periods (N=10), the mean is approximately 71.8 units. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history, including the most recent arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 36 units and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 252 units. Given we are at Period 49 out of 50, this is the final ordering decision. I will use a 10-period window (recent_N) for both demand mean and volatility to capture the current stable regime while filtering out early-game noise. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5 periods total).

Daily Profit: $180.00, Daily Holding Cost: $61.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 27, with a mean demand of approximately 71.3 units per period (Periods 27-49). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 61 units and 275 units in-transit (covering orders from Periods 46-49), the current position is healthy. To balance profit and holding costs, I am using recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations, focusing on the stable regime since Period 27 (N=23). This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant statistics for this SKU's current behavior.
