Orders placed in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9 are currently in-transit (83, 89, 57, 135 = 364 units total). Based on the lead time of 4, the Period 6 order (83 units) is expected to arrive during Period 10, and the Period 7 order (89 units) during Period 11. Demand analysis: The historical average demand is approximately 103 units per period (61, 107, 84, 144, 69 from pre-game; 66, 117, 122, 92, 93, 93, 68, 123, 150 from game history). Recent demand has shown an upward trend (123, 150). The OR algorithm suggests ordering 147 units based on a base-stock policy. Given the lead time of 4, the inventory must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Current pipeline (364) + current on-hand (12) = 376 units. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~515 units. There is a projected deficit. However, the OR recommendation of 147 units, when added to the pipeline, brings total coverage to 523 units, which aligns well with the 5-period demand requirement. The Period 10 arrival (83 units) plus current on-hand (12) equals 95 units, which might result in a minor stockout in Period 10 if demand stays at 150, but we cannot expedite current arrivals.

Given that the pipeline (440) divided by (L+1=5) covers 88 units/period, and 181 on-hand units represent nearly 2 periods of average demand, the current position is relatively high due to the low demand in Period 25. 5. **Strategy**: Following the OR recommendation of 70 units is prudent.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 110 units, and there are 297 units in-transit. The breakdown of the pipeline (based on orders from P34-P37) is: P34 (55), P35 (126), P36 (44), and P37 (72). Order P34 is expected to arrive in Period 38 (visible in P39 conclude). The OR recommendation of 87 units is aimed at maintaining a base-stock level that covers the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 5 periods). Given that the current on-hand plus in-transit inventory (110 + 297 = 407 units) covers roughly 5 periods of average demand (5 * 82 = 410), the OR recommendation of 87 units essentially replaces one period of expected demand to keep the pipeline full.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been slightly lower than the long-term average (P42: 31, P43: 67, P44: 74, P45: 32, P46: 79). The game is approaching its end (Period 47 of 50). \n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 78 units. However, my goal is to maximize profit while minimizing holding costs as the game concludes. Ordering 78 units would arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). My current pipeline + on-hand (394 units) must cover demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50. With an average demand of ~80 units, I need approximately 320 units. Since I already have 394 units total (202 on-hand + 192 in-transit), I am currently overstocked for the remaining periods. Any further orders will only increase holding costs and arrive too late to be sold.",

The game ends at Period 50. Total periods remaining to satisfy demand for are 49 and 50. \n4. **Final Strategy**: Period 49 is the penultimate decision point, but because the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 53 (49+4). Since the game ends at Period 50, further orders are futile. Total units available to satisfy demand for Periods 49 and 50 are: 169 (On-hand) + 72 (ETA P49) + 28 (ETA P50) = 269 units.

In this SKU's execution sequence, any order placed in the current period (Period N) will not arrive until Period N+L (where L=4). Since the game ends at Period 50, an order placed now will arrive at Period 54, well after the game has concluded. Therefore, any capital spent on ordering now will not result in units available for sale and will only reduce the total profit. Looking at the current inventory, there are 158 units on-hand, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand for the final period (historical average is ~80 units). Consequently, the optimal decision is to order 0 units to maximize the final reward by avoiding unnecessary procurement costs.",
