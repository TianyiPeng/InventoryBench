The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) should arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6).

The OR recommendation of 212 units is based on the capped base-stock policy. Given that demand in Period 1 was high (216) but subsequent periods were lower (avg ~127), and we have zero inventory to start, a bulk order is necessary to build the pipeline. The OR's 212 units roughly covers one period of high demand plus a safety margin, but since we are filling an empty pipeline for a 5-period window (P1-P5), I will follow the recommendation as a starting point to establish the pipeline without over-committing before confirming the actual lead time.",

Given it is only Period 2 and we are in a stockout state (on-hand 0), we need to build a pipeline to cover the 4-period lead time gap.

The mean demand is approximately 133 units/period.\n3. **Lead Time Inference**: Since we are only at Period 4, no orders placed within the game have reached their Promised Lead Time (L=4) arrival date yet. I will continue to assume L=4 holds until evidence suggests otherwise.\n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation of 193 units is based on a base-stock policy intended to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Total pipeline (In-transit + current order) should target this level. Current pipeline is 614. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~665. The OR recommendation of 193 seems slightly high relative to a simple mean-based calculation, but it accounts for safety stock (Standard Deviation ~3-4) and the high critical fractile (Profit/Profit+Holding = 19/20 = 0.95). \n5. **Strategy**: I will follow the OR recommendation.

Strategy: The current total inventory (680) is slightly below the 5-period target (720). The OR recommendation of 150 units seems high given that 620 units are already in the pipeline, but the OR recommendation is 'capped' and accounts for the standard deviation and safety stock.

The current 'In-transit' + 'On-hand' (660 units) covers approximately 4.5 periods of average demand. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to maintain a pipeline that covers the current period plus the 4-period lead time (5 periods total).\n4. **OR Baseline Evaluation**: The OR recommendation of 164 is based on a base-stock policy. My calculation for 5 periods of demand (146.5 * 5 = 732.5) suggests we are slightly under-stocked relative to the pipeline target (660 < 732.5). However, demand has been slightly higher in recent periods (P8-P10 average: 162.3). \n5. **Adjustment**: The OR recommendation of 164 is sensible as it aligns with the recent slight uptick in demand and maintains the required safety stock.

Demand Analysis: As noted in Carry-over Insights, demand shifted down around P16 from ~150 to ~85 units. Recent demand (P23-P27) averages 68.6 units.

However, given that demand has been even lower recently (sub-85), I will moderate the OR's 193 units down to 110 units to avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against stockouts, as the current on-hand (67) is just barely enough for one period of the new regime's demand.",

The sum of inventory (377) covers roughly 4.9 periods of demand at the current rate (77/period). Since the lead time is 4, we need to ensure local availability for L+1 (5) periods. 377 units is just slightly short of the 385 units (77 * 5) required to cover the current cycle.

The demand regime shift noted in Period 19 (dropping from ~150 to ~85 units) is still the most accurate baseline for planning, as recent demand (P35-P39) averages approximately 81 units. Calculations: Expected demand for the next 5 periods is 85 * 5 = 425 units. Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 396 units (from orders in P36, P37, P38, P39).

The OR recommendation of 179 units appears to be reacting to the stockout in P39 and the large variance in demand history, but it would likely lead to overstocking given the recent lower demand regime (~80 units). However, looking at the pipeline, the P38 order of 181 units is a massive spike that will arrive in P42. If I order 179 now, I will create a massive surplus in P45.

OR Analysis: The OR recommendation of 179 units is based on the long-term historical mean (approx 105 units including early high-demand periods). However, since the demand shift at P19, the average demand is closer to 85. Applying the base-stock logic (L+1=5 periods) with the current regime: 5 * 85 = 425 units required for the pipeline.

Total expected demand for these 5 periods at 85 units/period is 425 units. The OR recommendation is 177 units, which targets a total stock of 575 (398 + 177). Given we only have 5 periods left in the game, ending with excess inventory incurs holding costs and reduces total profit. To cover the remaining 425 units of demand with 398 already in transit, we only need roughly 27-50 more units to account for safety stock, not 177. However, we must ensure we don't stock out in the final periods.

The order from P45 is due to arrive in Period 49 (after the current decision). \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand since the regime shift (P16 onwards) is approximately 80-85 units per period. The recent periods (P47, P48) show demand of 97 and 79, consistent with this average. \n4. **Pipeline Coverage**: We have 278 units in-transit.
