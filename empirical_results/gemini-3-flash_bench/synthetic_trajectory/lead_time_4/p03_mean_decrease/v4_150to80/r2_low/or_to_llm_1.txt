Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we should aim for a base stock near the mean. Our current inventory position is already far above what is required for the next 5 periods (approx 330 units). 5. **Adjustment**: I will override the OR recommendation of 55 and order 0 units to allow the current oversupply to bleed off, as the holding cost is equal to the profit margins.",

Therefore, the P24 order (104 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 28 and become visible in the P28 conclude message. Demand Analysis: While demand shifted downward around P16, recent demand (P24: 102, P25: 123, P26: 72, P27: 59) has shown a slight uptick compared to the Period 18-23 lows (~70). The OR recommendation of 9 units is extremely low because it likely factors in the huge pipeline (591) against the long-term average, but it ignores the immediate stockout risk for Period 29 before the larger P26/P27 orders arrive. The 591 units in transit is more than enough to cover the remaining game duration given the current demand regime. Strategy: We are overstocked in the pipeline (total need for remaining 23 periods at ~80 demand/period is ~1840, but we need to manage holding costs).

This is lower than the previously noted 'stabilized' average of 95 units but slightly higher than the Period 18 drop.

Any order placed in Period 50 will arrive at the start of the resolution phase for Period 54 (observed at the start of Period 55). Since the game ends at Period 50, and the Demand Resolution phase for Period 50 occurs AFTER the decision phase, the current 128 units on-hand are sufficient to cover the final period's demand without risking a stockout.
