Period 1 shows a spike (216), but periods 2-5 are fairly stable around 125-130 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. To calculate the necessary order, I must cover demand for the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Based on an estimated mean demand of 145/period, total demand over 5 periods is ~725 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will order 725 units to establish a pipeline and reach the target stock level.",

Given for P30-P34 (next 5 periods) we need to cover demand with the pipeline + new order, we project demand at ~100 units/period (reflecting the recovery trend). Target Inventory for L+1 (5 periods): 500 units. Current pipeline (P26-P29): 100 + 130 + 120 + 120 = 470 units.

Since the game is nearing its end (P46 of 50), and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed in Period 46 will arrive in Period 50. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I need to ensure that the remaining demand for P46-P50 is covered. Estimated demand for 5 periods is 425. My current total stock (on-hand + in-transit) is 432, which slightly exceeds this.
