Excluding the first-period spike, the average demand is approximately 128 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since my current on-hand inventory is 0 and I have nothing in-transit, I am in a stockout position and must cover the demand for the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). My target pipeline is (5 periods * 128 units/period) = 640 units. Given the initial spike in data, I will order slightly more than the baseline average to ensure coverage while I wait for lead-time confirmation and more stable demand observations.",

Since I cannot satisfy demand until the first shipment arrives, my goal is to build a pipeline to cover demand from Period 6 onwards.

Lead Time Analysis: Promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order (650 units) is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' of Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Therefore, we will face stockouts in P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5. Pipeline Assessment: Our pipeline (800) must cover demand for L+1 periods (P3, P4, P5, P6, P7). Estimating demand at ~165/period (conservative average of recent demand), 5 periods of demand equals ~825 units. Since we have 800 in transit and 0 on hand, we are slightly under-covered for the lead time window.

Analyzing historical demand (Periods 1-14), the mean demand is approximately 146 units per period (ranging from 82 to 216), confirming a stable demand regime of ~150 units. Lead time analysis: Orders from P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10 have all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods. Note: No orders were placed in P4/P5, explaining the zero arrivals in P8/P9. The promised lead time of 4 is reliable. Current status at Period 15: On-hand inventory is 232. In-transit consists of orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14 (150 units each, totaling 600). These are expected to arrive in Periods 15, 16, 17, and 18 respectively. To calculate the order: Targeted Inventory Position (IP) = Average Demand * (Lead Time + 1) + Safety Stock. With L=4, demand covers 5 periods. Demand for 5 periods ~ 750 units. Current IP = On-hand (232) + In-transit (600) = 832. This IP already covers the next 5-6 periods of demand (~150 * 5.5). Since the current IP (832) is slightly above the 5-period requirement (750) but aligns with a modest safety stock buffer to handle demand variance (max demand observed was 216), I will order 150 units to maintain the pipeline and replace the units consumed in the previous period, ensuring a steady flow of 150 units arriving every period.",

Since we are at Period 42 out of 50, we need to cover demand for the remaining 9 periods (P42 to P50). Total expected demand for the rest of the game is approximately 800 units (9 periods * ~89 units). My current stock (170) plus in-transit (155) equals 325 units, which will only last through approximately Period 45. To ensure we don't stock out before the game ends, particularly considering the 4-period lead time, I must keep ordering. The next arrivals will be from P40 (55 units arriving P44) and P41 (100 units arriving P45). I will order 100 units now to arrive in Period 46.",
