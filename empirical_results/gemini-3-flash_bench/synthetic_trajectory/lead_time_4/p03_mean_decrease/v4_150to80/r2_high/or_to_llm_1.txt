The product is 'chips(Regular)', which typically has stable demand, though the historical samples (P1-P5) show a mean of approximately 145 units/period. The provided lead time is 4 periods.

OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 204 units based on a base-stock level calculated for (L+1) = 5 periods. 4. Strategy: Since we have zero on-hand and the first shipment is 4 periods away, we must continue ordering to build the pipeline. The OR recommendation of 204 is reasonable given the demand average and the current pipeline of 212. Over the next 4 periods (P2, P3, P4, P5), we expect total demand of roughly 520-540 units.

Using a conservative mean of 110 (accounting for potential slight growth) and safety stock, a base stock level around 600-650 is appropriate.

The historical mean used by OR (now influenced by earlier high-demand periods) overestimates current needs.\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 112. In-transit consists of orders from P42 (179), P43 (60), P44 (20), and P45 (176), totaling 435 units. \n4. **Timing to End-of-Game**: We are at Period 46. With a 4-period lead time, the order placed now (P46) arrives during P50 resolution. This is the absolute LAST order that will contribute to sales before the game ends at the conclusion of P50. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive in time.\n5. **Requirement Calculation**: Total periods remaining for the P46 order to cover: P46, P47, P48, P49, P50 (5 periods). Expected total demand = 5 * 70 = 350 units. Current inventory (112) + Reliable Pipeline (P42-P45: 435) = 547 units. \n6. **Decision**: Since the existing pipeline (547 units) significantly exceeds the projected demand for the final five periods (350 units), placing any further orders would only increase holding costs at the end of the game.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile, with an average of approximately 80 units over the last 10 periods, though the most recent period spiked to 119. The simulation is near its end (Period 47 of 50). This means orders placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4), which is AFTER the game ends. \n3.

Strategy: Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed in P47, P48, P49, or P50 will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or generate profit. On-hand inventory plus the arriving pipeline (60 + 20 + 176 = 256 units) will be more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand (P47-P50), which is estimated at roughly 320-400 units total.
