This means orders placed now will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105), the average demand is 92.2 units per period. The OR recommendation of 122 units is calculated using a base-stock policy targeting the review+lead time window (1+L = 5 periods). However, since we start at absolute zero and the first 5 periods of demand must be satisfied by initial inventory (which is currently 0), we are guaranteed stockouts until Period 5 concludes. My goal is to build the pipeline to cover the lead-time window. The OR recommendation is capped to prevent over-ordering, but given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the critical fractile is very high (~0.95), suggesting we should lean toward the higher end of the demand distribution to avoid lost sales.

Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical fractile is very high (~0.95), justifying a robust safety stock. However, since we are in the early stages and the pipeline already contains one period's worth of demand plus a buffer, following the OR recommendation of 118 units is a sound strategy to build the necessary pipeline to cover the (L+1) horizon (5 periods) while accounting for the initial stockout and historical variance.",

According to the lead-time definition, the Period 1 order (placed at the start of P1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. We are currently at the start of Period 5's decision phase; therefore, the first arrival (from P1) has not happened yet but is expected this period. Total in-transit is 499 (122+118+131+128).\n\n2. Inventory & Demand Analysis: Historical demand over 5 periods is 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (Average ~92). Realized demand from game history (P1-P4) was 75, 129, 93, 149 (Average ~111.5). There is no specific seasonal data or product description besides 'chips(Regular)'. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we have stocked out for 4 consecutive periods. We need to satisfy demand for Period 5 (arriving P1 order) and subsequent periods.\n\n3. OR Baseline Evaluation: The OR recommendation is 101 units. This is based on a base-stock policy for (L+1) = 5 periods. Total pipeline is 499 units. This pipeline roughly covers 5 periods of demand at the current average (5 * 100 = 500).\n\n4. Final Strategy: Since we have a full pipeline for the promised lead time and are expecting the first shipment to arrive *this* period (P5), we should maintain a steady order flow to avoid future gaps.

Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 122 units.\n\n4. Strategy & OR Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 131 units is based on the entire history (including high-demand periods 1-16), which significantly inflates the estimate. Using the current demand regime (~31 units/period) and a lead time of 4, the total inventory needed to cover (L+1) periods is approximately 31 * 5 = 155 units (plus a small safety stock buffer). With 122 units currently on hand and no incoming shipments, ordering the OR-recommended 131 would put total inventory at 253, which is excessive (over 8 periods of current demand) and would lead to high holding costs. I will adjust the order downward to aim for a total inventory level of approximately 160 units (covering 5 periods of demand at ~32 units/period). 160 - 122 = 38 units.",

Since current on-hand + in-transit is exactly 150 units, and the goal is to avoid excessive holding costs in a low-demand phase while maintaining a buffer, ordering a small amount to maintain safety stock is prudent.

Inventory Position Gap: The pipeline is currently healthy for a 4-period lead time. However, the game ends in 4 periods (Period 50). Orders placed now (P46) would arrive in Period 50. The OR recommendation of 123 is overly aggressive because its logic includes safety stock across all history and doesn't account for the end-of-horizon. 5.

However, with only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), any order placed now will arrive at the very end (P51 conclusion), meaning it cannot be sold. \n5. **Strategy**: Since the game ends at Period 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, an order placed in Period 47 arrives at the end of Period 51 (visible Period 52). Therefore, any order placed now will only incur holding costs and contribute nothing to profit.
