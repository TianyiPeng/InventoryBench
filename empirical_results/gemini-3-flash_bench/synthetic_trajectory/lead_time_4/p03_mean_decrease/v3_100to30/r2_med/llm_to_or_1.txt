Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history to analyze via 'conclude' messages, but we have 5 pre-game demand samples for 'chips(Regular)': [109, 68, 99, 80, 105]. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since inventory starts at 0 and the current pipeline is 0, we must place an order immediately to cover demand over the lead time (L) plus the review period (1). The mean of the 5 samples is (109+68+99+80+105)/5 = 92.2. The standard deviation is 17.15. The promised lead time L = 4 implies a coverage period of L+1 = 5. I will use the 'default' methods which calculate stats based on all available samples (the 5 provided). This will set mu_hat \u2248 5 * 92.2 = 461 and sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(5) * 17.15 \u2248 38.35. The OR backend will use these to determine the base stock level and order quantity to maximize reward.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 146 units were demanded, but since there was 0 on-hand inventory, all demand was lost (0 sold). An order of 122 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning this arrival is expected in Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Demand for the first 5 periods was recorded as [109, 68, 99, 80, 105], averaging ~92.2 units per period. In Period 1, we saw a spike to 146. Given the high stockout risk and the fact that we have 0 on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available samples (including the recent 146) to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the lead time (L+1) demand. Since L=4, we need coverage for 5 periods. Using 'default' methods will leverage all available historical data including the recent spike.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, 122 units were ordered, and in Period 2, 146 units were ordered, totaling 268 units in transit. Given the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (L=4). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales for the demand of 146 and 81 respectively. The demand history shows: P1=109 (pre-game), P2=68 (pre-game), P3=99 (pre-game), P4=80 (pre-game), P5=105 (pre-game). However, the actual demand observed during P1 and P2 was 146 and 81. Mean of available samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105, 146, 81) is approximately 98.4. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat = 5 * 98.4 = 492. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand statistics including the two actual observed periods.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4). Consistent with this, the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-3 correctly show 0 arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 409 units in-transit (P1: 122, P2: 146, P3: 141). Historical demand samples (including pre-game) show a mean of approximately 92.2 units (samples: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105, 146, 81, 108). The last three periods (146, 81, 108) average 111.6, suggesting slightly higher demand than the initial samples. Since we are waiting for the first delivery in Period 5, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand while accounting for the promised lead time of 4. This sets the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (122 units) is scheduled to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (1+4=5). Since we are currently in the decision phase of Period 5, we have not yet seen any arrivals in the 'conclude' messages (as expected). The 'In-transit' balance of 558 units correctly reflects the sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (122+146+141+149). Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 102 units over the first 4 periods (146, 81, 108, 72). Since there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods, or that a regime shift has occurred, I am using the default settings which aggregate all available historical data. This will set the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the order from Period 1 (122 units) arrived in Period 5 conclude (after Period 5's demand resolution), confirming the actual lead time L=4 matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for periods 1-5 exhibits some volatility (146, 81, 108, 72, 69) with a mean of 95.2. Period 1 had significantly higher demand compared to the subsequent four periods. Currently, 53 units are on-hand and 436 units are in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand profile while smoothing out the high demand seen in Period 1. L is set to default as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived at the end of P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by two consecutive arrivals: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 conclude (LT=4) and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6 conclude (LT=4). Demand history shows a mean of approximately 91.6 units across the first 6 periods (146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74). However, the demand in the last three periods (72, 69, 74) is noticeably lower and more stable (avg ~71.6) compared to the initial volatility. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory position is On-hand (125) + In-transit (338) = 463. I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture this recent relative stability while ensuring the OR engine uses the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from Orders 1, 2, and 3). Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after an initial spike in Period 1, with the most recent 6 periods (P2-P7) showing a mean demand of approximately 83.6 units. The current on-hand inventory is 168 units, with 250 units in-transit (orders from P4, P6, and P7). Order 4 (149 units) is expected to arrive at the end of Period 8. To optimize the OR backend, I am using recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to reflect the stabilized demand rather than the high P1 outlier. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to capture current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead times are consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand across the last 8 periods has averaged ~91.75 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 231 units, and there are 132 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 6, 7, and 8). The backend OR logic uses L+1 (5 periods) for its calculations. Total demand over 5 periods is expected to be around 458-460 units. Pipeline inventory (On-hand 231 + In-transit 132 = 363) is currently below this requirement, but the OR engine's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic will handle the order quantity once we provide accurate mu and sigma. I used a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat because the demand has been stable without significant regime shifts. This ensures the backend uses all available historical performance data since Period 1 to calculate the parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time L=4 is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived with exactly 4 periods of lead time). No order was placed in P5, so the 'arrived=0' in the P9 conclude message is expected. Demand remains stable with values: 146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74, 98, 86, 105. The average demand over these 9 periods is ~93.2 units per period. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand, approximately 466 units. Current inventory status: On-hand (126) + In-transit (266) = 392 units. This indicates we are slightly below the target of ~460-500 units. I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed lead time of 4. Since demand has been relatively stable without a clear regime shift, I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all historical samples for a robust baseline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 331 (comprising orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~92.2 over the first 10 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture all available history while the system is in a stable regime. Setting L to 'calculate' effectively uses the confirmed 4-period lead time. Parameters reflect a 1+4=5 period planning horizon to cover demand until the next order can arrive.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7 all arriving exactly 4 periods after ordering. Note that P5 had an order of 0, explaining the 'arrived=0' in the P9 conclude message. The current on-hand inventory is low (14), but there is a significant pipeline of 387 units. Specifically, the order of 31 units from P8 is expected to arrive during P12 and will be visible in the P13 start. Demand has remained relatively stable; the mean of all 11 samples is 95.6, while the recent 5-period mean (P7-P11) is slightly higher at 101.2. Given the stable demand and confirmed lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the slight recent increase in demand, and 'calculate' for L since the observed lead times match the promised value of 4 precisely.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 order arrived end of P5, P2 end of P6, etc.). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the last period (P12) resulted in 38 units of lost sales due to insufficient stock. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 491, consisting of orders from P9 (134), P10 (113), P11 (109), and P12 (135). According to the lead time of 4, the P9 order (134 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P13), meaning it will be available for demand in P13 but only visible in the P13 conclude message at the start of P14. Demand has been relatively stable; the mean demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 94.5 units, while the initial 5 samples averaged 92.2. There is no strong evidence of a regime shift, so I will use a recent_N approach (N=12) to capture the full observed history while being responsive to the slight upward trend compared to the initial seed. Setting L to 4 reflects the confirmed lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Historically, for chips(Regular), the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5-8, 10-13). The demand mean over the last 13 periods is approximately 93.7 units, but recent demand (P9-P13) has stayed relatively stable around an average of 97 units. In P12, we experienced a stockout (sold 45 vs demand 83) due to low inventory. In P13, the order from P9 arrived, replenishing the stock. Currently, we have 50 units on-hand and 381 in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13). To ensure we cover projected demand for the review + lead time window (L+1=5 periods), and given the lead time stability, 'calculate' is used for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=8 is selected to capture the post-initial-volatility regime and stabilize the forecast against the P12 stockout impact.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on order arrivals from P1 through P10 (arriving P5 to P14). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 327 units in-transit. Demand has shown a significant recent increase: the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaged 108.6 units, compared to the overall average of 92.2 and the earlier relatively stable period. Period 14 specifically saw a spike to 163 units, causing a stockout. Given the promised lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My target base stock uses a recent window (N=5) to capture this upward demand trend and heightened volatility. Setting L to 4 (promised/calculated), mu_hat to cover recent demand (approx 108.6 * 5 = 543), and sigma_hat based on recent high volatility to ensure sufficient service level despite the stockout in P14.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~85 (P1-P9) to ~109 (P10-P14), with a notable spike of 163 in P14.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend. A regime shift was identified around Period 10, where average demand increased from ~85 to ~106. Recent demand spikes (e.g., Period 14 with 163 units) and the stockout in Period 14 suggest higher volatility and the need for a more responsive forecast. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory (381 units) includes orders from Periods 12-15. Specifically, the Period 12 order (135 units) is expected to arrive this period (Period 16), which will help replenish the current low on-hand stock of 40. I will use a recent_N of 6 periods (P10-P15) for mu_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime while using the standard calculation for lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-100.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe an ending on-hand inventory of 160 units following Period 16. Analyzing the demand history, there was a significant regime shift around Period 10; mean demand from P1-P9 was ~98.4, but from P10-P16 (excluding the outlier in P16), it rose to ~102, with a extreme spike of 163 in P14. The extremely low demand of 15 in P16 appears to be a downward outlier or a correction after the spike. Lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15, P16). I am setting L to 'calculate' to rely on this observed stability. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering P10-P16) to capture the higher mean compared to the initial phase, while acknowledging the recent volatility. This provides a balanced forecast across the (L+1=5) period risk window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to account for the increased variance seen in the recent spike and drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-64.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18. Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and recent arrivals in P15, P16, and P17). Demand analysis shows a regime shift previously noted around Period 10-15. However, the last two periods (P16 and P17) showed significantly lower demand (15 and 24 respectively), following a high-volatility period. This suggests either a cooldown after a spike or high noise. Since the promised lead time is 4, we must account for demand over (1+L) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat (covering P10-P17) captures the recent higher mean (~82.5) while acknowledging the extreme variability. The in-transit inventory is high (375), and on-hand is 160. Setting L to default (4) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the backend base-stock calculation reflects the higher volatility and recent mean shifts seen since Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 14, with demand ranging from 15 to 163 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows extreme volatility following a period of relative stability. Periods 14-18 recorded demand values of 163, 69, 15, 24, and 29. While there was a significant peak in Period 14, the last three periods (16-18) have shown a sharp decline in demand (averaging 22.6 units). This suggests the 'demand regime shift' noted in Period 15 was an isolated spike or short-lived peak, and we are now in a low-demand phase. The on-hand inventory (190) plus in-transit (316, total 506) is significantly higher than any projected 5-period demand (L+1 = 5) based on recent activity. I will set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time remains consistent. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent sharp drop and high volatility, which will prevent the OR backend from over-ordering while we work through high existing stock. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the massive variance seen between Period 14 (163) and Period 16 (15).

Carry-over insight: Demand has sharply declined since Period 16, averaging ~23 units over the last 3 periods, contrasting with the high-demand signal seen in Period 14-15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-238.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sharp and sustained decline since Period 16. Over the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been 15, 24, 29, and 23 units, averaging 22.75 units. This is a significant drop from the previous regime which averaged over 100 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 330 units, which is extremely high (covering roughly 14 periods of demand at the current rate), and there are an additional 153 units in-transit (ordered in P16). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and low demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the low-demand regime and prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders. This will allow on-hand inventory to deplete naturally while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: Constant low-demand phase averaging ~23 units (P16-P19), down from previous high-demand peaks. Inventory is currently sufficient for >10 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-243.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently holds 435 units on-hand with zero in-transit inventory. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), the demand has averaged approximately 27.8 units per period (15, 24, 29, 23, 48), which is a significant drop from the mean of the first 15 periods (~95 units). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). Even using a conservative demand estimate of 48 units/period, the required inventory would be roughly 240 units. Current on-hand inventory (435) is more than sufficient to cover demand for the foreseeable future plus the lead time. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs ($1/unit/period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to reflect this low-demand state and allow the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize. L is set to calculated to reflect the stable observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P20) average demand: 27.8 units/period. Inventory levels are high (435 units), exceeding requirements for the next 5+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-275.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a low-demand regime that began in Period 16. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged 28.5 units/period (15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32), a significant drop from the mean of ~109 observed in the previous regime (P10-P15). The current on-hand inventory is 403 units, with no units in transit. Given the current average demand of ~28.5 units and a (lead time + 1) requirement, the base stock target should be approximately 143 units (5 * 28.5). Since on-hand inventory (403) significantly exceeds this target and any reasonable safety stock, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect this new low-demand environment, which effectively signals the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a confirmed low-demand regime that began around Period 16. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged 26.57 units per period, a significant drop from the previous high-demand phase. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P19-P22) have seen demand of 23, 48, 32, and 25 units. Current on-hand inventory is 378 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand (~27/period) and a lead time of 4, the total inventory required for (L+1) periods (5 periods) is approximately 135 units. The current stock is nearly triple this requirement. To minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted, I am setting L to the calculated average of 4, mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=7), and sigma_hat based on the recent volatility which has stabilized relative to the P14 spike. No new orders will be generated by the OR backend as current inventory (378) significantly exceeds the base stock level derived from these parameters.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a low-demand regime that began at Period 16. Over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), the average demand has been approximately 28.9 units (15, 24, 29, 23, 48, 32, 25, 35). Current on-hand inventory is 343 units with zero in-transit, which covers more than 10 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My objective is to prevent further accumulation of holding costs while the system clears excess inventory. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=8) to capture this lower mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) as volatility has stabilized within this low range. No new orders are expected or required at this stage.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P23) remains stable, averaging ~29 units/period. Inventory is significantly overstocked relative to current consumption.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 28.5 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 306 units with zero units in transit. Given the current average demand, this inventory covers more than 10 periods (306 / 28.5 \u2248 10.7), which is well beyond the look-ahead window of L+1 (5 periods). The OR backend's capped policy will automatically result in zero orders as the pipeline inventory exceeds the base stock level. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=9) to ensure the backend accurately calculates the safety stock requirements for this new phase, preventing unnecessary replenishment and minimizing holding costs.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-demand regime since Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is approximately 30.8 units/period, with a slight uptick to 62 units in the most recent period (P25). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 244 units with zero in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 4 periods and a calculation of (L+1)=5 periods of demand coverage, my current stock (244 units) covers over 8 periods of the current average demand (244 / 30.8 \u2248 7.9). Therefore, the system should not place new orders yet. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect this current low-demand regime and allow the inventory to deplete. The OR backend will see that on-hand (244) > base_stock (roughly 31 * 5 + safety stock), resulting in a zero order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 11 periods (P16 to P26), the mean demand has stabilized around 34.5 units per period, compared to the previously observed high of over 100 units. Current on-hand inventory is 185 units with zero in-transit. With an average demand of ~35 units and a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline (+ on-hand) inventory to cover (L+1) or 5 periods of demand is approximately 175 units (35 * 5). Since on-hand inventory (185) is still slightly above this target, no new order is required. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time of 4. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the current low-demand regime statistics since Period 16, allowing the system to gradually bleed off the remaining excess inventory while maintaining a safe service level for the new demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P26) mean demand identified at approximately 34.5 units/period (N=11).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the mean demand is approximately 33.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory has decreased to 154 units with 21 units in-transit (total pipeline = 175). Based on a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~167 units over this window (33.3 * 5), the current total inventory of 175 is nearly optimal, slightly above the target. To maintain this balance and account for the recent slight upward tick in demand (59, 31), I will use the recent 12 periods (since the regime shift) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P27) consolidated: average demand 33.3 units/period (N=12). Higher demand spikes in P25(62) and P26(59) were transient, returning to ~31 in P27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) shows a mean demand of approximately 35.5 units/period (average of P16-P28). Although there was a peak in Period 28 (63 units), the overall trend remains significantly lower than the P10-P15 peak. On-hand inventory is 91 units and the pipeline (in-transit) is 49 units (from P27 and P28 orders). Total inventory position is 140 units. With an expected demand of 35.5 and a lead time of 4, the required coverage (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 177 units. To ensure sufficient stock while managing holding costs (profit/holding cost ratio is 4:1), I will use the last 13 samples (the low-demand regime starting at P16) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P28) average demand updated to 35.5 units/period (N=13) following a higher demand observation of 63 in P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the low-demand regime established around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 29 (N=14), the mean demand is approximately 36.1 units per period. The recent demand has shown some fluctuations (63 in P28 vs 22 in P29), suggesting a slight increase in volatility compared to the initial low-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Our current pipeline (On-hand: 69, In-transit: 113) totals 182 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. At a mean of 36.1, the expected requirement is ~180.5 units. The current total inventory of 182 aligns almost exactly with this requirement. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=14) to reflect the current regime and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the recent moderate variance in this regime. L will remain at default.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P29) mean demand is 36.1 units/period (N=14). Inventory levels have finally normalized from the previous overstock situation.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The low-demand regime established in Period 16 continues. From Period 16 (N=15), the average demand is approximately 35.6 units per period. While there have been sporadic spikes (P25: 62, P26: 59, P28: 63), demand has generally regressed toward the mean, with the most recent Period 30 showing 29 units. Inventory has finally been drawn down to 40 units on-hand. We have 142 units in-transit (ordered P27-P30), meaning the pipeline is replenishing. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since we have transitioned from a long overstock period back to active replenishment, I will use a N=15 window (encompassing the entire low-demand regime since P16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the average low demand with the volatility observed in the recent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 31 (N=16), the mean demand is approximately 35.1 units per period. Recent observations (P29-P31) show demand levels of 22, 29, and 29, supporting this regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the P27 order in P31. On-hand inventory is 32 units, and pipeline inventory is 146 units (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). Total inventory position (178 units) is being managed to cover the expected demand across the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). Using N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the characteristics of the current demand regime while smoothing out transient spikes like those seen in P25 and P28.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P31) mean demand stabilized at approximately 35 units/period (N=16). Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 17 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is approximately 34.6 units per period. Recent observations from P29-P32 (22, 29, 29, 23) suggest an even lower recent mean (~25.75), but the presence of occasional spikes (63 in P28, 62 in P25) justifies maintaining a slightly broader window for the forecast to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=17 covers this stabilized regime. Current on-hand (37) plus in-transit (144) is 181, which is approximately 5.2x the regime mean, suggesting the OR backend will place minimal replenishment orders as inventory is healthy.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P32) mean demand is 34.6 units/period (N=17), with lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 16, following a period of high volatility. Analysis of the last 18 periods (P16-P33) shows a mean demand of approximately 36 units per period. The inventory levels have successfully normalized after the significant overstocking event earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is 41, and there are 100 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33), which effectively covers the pipeline for the promised lead time of 4 periods. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods without disruption. I will continue to use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the characteristics of this stable regime while filtering out the high-demand volatility from earlier periods. This approach maintains a consistent service level while minimizing holding costs as the simulation progresses towards its conclusion.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 34-35 units per period. Recent observations from Period 30 to 34 (29, 29, 23, 60, 18) continue to reflect this mean with some intermittent spikes. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34. Current on-hand inventory is 52 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 133 units (ordered in P31, P32, P33, and P34). Given the 4-period lead time, we must account for demand over L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=19 (covering P16-P34) captures the current regime accurately. This approach allows the OR engine to set a base stock that covers expected demand while the cap prevents over-ordering as we manage the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P34) mean demand is 35.1 units/period (N=19). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained in a low-demand state since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 35.1 units/period over the last 20 periods (N=20). Recent demand has shown some volatility (e.g., 60 in P33 and 18 in P34), but the overall mean remains stable. The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 52 units, and in-transit inventory is 128 units (total pipeline of 180 units). Given a lead time of 4, the base stock should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With a mean of ~35, the expected requirement is ~175 units. Currently, the total inventory (180) is closely aligned with this requirement. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the statistics of this stable low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for lead time as it has been reliably 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P35) mean demand is 34.6 units/period (N=20). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-regime phase since Period 16. Over the last 21 periods (P16-P36), the mean demand is approximately 35 units per period. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. With L=4 and our review period of 1, the backend needs to cover a total lead time (L+1) of 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory (35) plus in-transit units (124) equals a total pipeline of 159 units. Using the recent 21-period regime to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock calculation reflects current stability rather than the high-volatility spikes seen earlier in the game. I will set N=21 to capture this consistent regime while excluding irrelevant data from before Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P36) mean demand is 35.0 units/period (N=21). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since Period 16. Over the last 22 periods (P16-P37), the average demand is approximately 34.7 units, with occasional spikes (e.g., P25, P26, P28, P33). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on all recent arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 26 units and in-transit inventory is 148 units (orders from P34-P37). Since total pipeline inventory (174) significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time plus review period ((4+1) * 35 = 175), the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to maintain the target base stock. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current demand mean and volatility while excluding the older, higher-demand regime, and utilize the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been highly consistent.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P37) mean demand is 34.7 units/period (N=22). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 34.7 units per period. The last observed demand was 42 units in Period 38. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 46 units, and there are 120 units in transit (expected from orders in periods 35, 36, 37, and 38). To maintain appropriate stock levels based on the current regime (N=23), I'm using recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand behavior while allowing the OR backend to adjust for recent variance. L is set to calculate as lead times have been extremely stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P38) mean demand is 35.0 units/period (N=23). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 16. Over the last 24 periods (P16-P39), the mean demand is approximately 35.0 units with relatively stable variance. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 31, and in-transit inventory is 146 (from orders in P36-P39), totaling 177 units. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At a mean of 35/period, expected demand over the lead time is 175. The OR backend will use the 'recent_N' method with N=24 to capture this regime accurately while ignoring the high-demand volatility seen earlier in the game. This ensures the ordering policy maintains enough stock to meet demand (service level ~80% based on profit/holding cost) without reverting to the overstock behavior seen in Periods 20-24.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P39) mean demand is 35.0 units/period (N=24). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable in a 'low-demand' phase since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 35.0 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current 'On-hand' inventory is very low (5 units), but 'In-transit' inventory is 149 units, which includes orders reaching back to Period 37. Specifically, the order from Period 37 (44 units) is expected to arrive during Period 41. Total pipeline inventory (149) plus on-hand (5) equals 154 units, which is significantly more than the required base stock for (L+1=5) periods of demand (~175 units). However, since we are at Period 41 and the goal is to optimize reward through Period 50, I will maintain the current regime parameters. I am using recent_N=25 for mu_hat (covering the stable regime starting at P16) and recent_N=25 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility levels within this regime.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P40) mean demand is 35.5 units/period (N=25). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 16, following a shift from high to low demand. Analyzing the last 26 periods (P16-P41), the mean demand is approximately 34.3 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 14.8. In Period 41, a notably low demand of 3 was observed, but this does not yet constitute a confirmed regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (P31 through P41). Current on-hand inventory is 46, and in-transit is 155, totaling 201 units. This pipeline is healthy compared to the expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods (approx 172 units). I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the established 'low-demand' regime while allowing for recent fluctuations like the P41 dip to weight the forecast slightly. L will use the 'calculate' method as it has been stable and consistent at 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 16, with the mean demand stabilizing at approximately 35.5 units per period over the last 25+ periods. Recent demand (P41: 3, P42: 40) is consistent with this regime, despite the low P41 observation. Lead time is reliably confirmed at 4 periods based on a long sequence of arrivals (P31 through P42). On-hand inventory is 40 units, with 130 units in transit (ordered P39-P42). Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the regime mean of 35.5, the total needed inventory is approximately 177.5 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 170 units, which is slightly below the target, but the OR engine's capped base-stock policy will manage the specific order quantity based on the provided mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use N=27 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire low-demand regime starting from P16.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the low-demand phase that started around Period 16. Analyzing the recent 28 periods (P16-P43), the mean demand is approximately 35.8 units per period. The most recent demand observations (P42: 40, P43: 51) are slightly above this average but within the expected volatility range. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (the most recent being Period 43, where the Period 39 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 35 units, and in-transit is 115 units, totaling 150 units of pipeline inventory. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. With a mean of ~36, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 180 units. The current pipeline of 150 units is slightly below this requirement. I will use recent_N with N=28 to capture the stable mean and variance of this current regime (P16-P43) while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock to meet target service levels.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P43) mean demand updated to 35.8 units/period (N=28). Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 16. In the most recent block (Periods 16-44, N=29), the mean demand is approximately 34.8 units per period. The recent behavior fluctuates significantly (e.g., Period 41 was 3 units, Period 43 was 51 units), but the overall average remains stable. The Lead Time is rock-solid at 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival since Period 31. On-hand inventory is 53, and in-transit is 144, totaling 197 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 197 / 5 \u2248 39.4 units/period, which is slightly above the regime mean. I will continue using the recent_N method with N=29 (covering the entire current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized but volatile state while maintaining the default lead time calculation.

In the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45), the average is slightly lower at 33.6 units per period, but the overall variance remains significant (standard deviation approx 15-20). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 55 units on-hand and 97 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44, P45), the total pipeline inventory is 152. Given the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P46) will arrive at the end of P50 (effectively too late to satisfy any further demand as the game conclude message for P50 is the final state). However, to maintain the service level for the final periods (P46-P50), I will set parameters based on the sustained regime since Period 16 (N=30) to capture the stable mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P45) mean demand remains stable at 36.2 units/period (N=30). Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 31 periods (P16-P46), the mean demand is approximately 36.7 units per period. Recent demand has fluctuated (P43: 51, P44: 7, P45: 48, P46: 53), but the overall trajectory remains stable around this mean. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (promised = actual). At the start of Period 47, on-hand inventory is low (11 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 138 units. Since the lead time is 4, the OR engine needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Expected requirement = 5 * 36.7 \u2248 184 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 11 + 138 = 149 units. We are slightly under-provisioned relative to the target, so the OR backend will place an order to bridge the gap toward the base stock level. I will use N=31 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P46) mean demand is 36.7 units/period (N=31). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues within the low-demand regime established in Period 16. Analyzing the last 32 periods (P16-P47), the mean demand is approximately 36.7 units per period. The standard deviation over this same window reflects the observed volatility. Recent demand has been erratic (e.g., 53 in P46 vs. 7 in P47), justifying the use of N=32 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime's behavior while smoothing transit signals. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 35, with 164 units in-transit. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained low-demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 48 (N=33), the mean demand is approximately 36.9 units/period. The most recent demand (P48) was 41, which sits slightly above the mean but well within the observed volatility of this regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 44 order in Period 48. Current on-hand inventory is 48 units, with 113 units in-transit (orders from P45, P46, P47, and P48). Given the game ends at Period 50, and current lead time is 4, any order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 53 (P49 + 4 = P53), which is past the game's horizon. Therefore, placing a large order now is unnecessary for service levels and would only increase potential holding costs if the simulation continues, though here it simply won't arrive. I will use N=33 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current regime's behavior and keep L at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P48) mean demand is 36.9 units/period (N=33). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since Period 16. Over the last 34 periods (P16-P49), the mean demand is approximately 36.4 units. Although individual periods show volatility (e.g., P41 demand was 3, P43 was 51), the overall average is consistent. The lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods, confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. Currently, we have 38 units on hand and 152 units in transit (orders from P46-P49). Given that L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At a mean of ~36.4, the 5-period target is ~182 units. Our total position (on-hand + in-transit) is 190, which is slightly above the target. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=34 to capture this entire regime, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as the backend's standard calculations are well-suited for this stable scenario.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P49) mean demand is 36.4 units/period (N=34). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.
