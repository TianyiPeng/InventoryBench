Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows values of 109, 68, 99, 80, and 105, with a mean of approximately 92.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.1. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit shipments yet, we need to establish an initial order based on these historical statistics to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'default' method for all parameters as there is currently no evidence of regime shifts in demand or deviations in lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 122 units with a promised lead time (L) of 4. As expected, no arrivals occurred in Period 1 (arrived=0) since L=4 \u2265 0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) show an average of 92.2 units (109, 68, 99, 80, 105). However, the specific demand observed in Period 1 of the game was 75 units. Since on-hand inventory was 0, all 75 units of demand were lost (sold=0). Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean of historical samples (92.2) results in a mu_hat calculation of approximately 461. The current pipeline (in-transit) is only 122 units, leaving a significant gap. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to establish a baseline forecast while the system reconciles the initial inventory stock-out.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', we have an on-hand inventory of 0 and 240 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 1 and 2). Demand has been moderate (75 in P1, 129 in P2), but we have sold 0 units because no stock has arrived yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is scheduled to arrive during Period 1+4=5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' messages for Period 1 and 2 are expected and do not indicate a delay or lost shipment yet. The current mean demand from historical data (P1-P5) is 92.2. With L=4, the exposure period is L+1=5. I will use 'default' methods for now as the sample size is small and the lead time hasn't had a chance to conclude yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (122 units), Period 2 (118 units), and Period 3 (131 units) are all in-transit (Total: 371). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales because demand occurred before any stock could arrive. The historical demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) provide a mean of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.1. Since there are only 5 samples and no clear regime shift yet, I will use the 'default' method for all parameters which utilizes all available historical data. This will set the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5, meaning they will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Consequently, as of Period 5's decision phase, the on-hand inventory is still 0, and all units (499) are in-transit. Demand over the first 4 periods (75, 129, 93, 149) averages 111.5 units per period. The historical samples provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) average 92.2. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most recent statistics while the system stabilizes. I'll stick with the promised lead time 'default' as we haven't reached the point where a lead time deviation could even be confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Looking at the history, the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 conclude (meaning it arrived during Period 5), confirming the actual lead time L=4, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is currently critical; we have 0 on-hand inventory because demand (140) exceeded the arrival (122) in Period 5, and we had zero starting stock. We have 485 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Demand samples for the first 5 periods (75, 129, 93, 149, 140) show a mean of 117.2 and a standard deviation of 30.6. There is a slight upward trend in recent demand (149 and 140), so I will use a window of N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture this variance without overreacting to the small sample size. The target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history (Samples: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105; Concluded: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99) shows high variance but a stable mean around 100-110 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Currently, we have 19 units on-hand and 528 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). The next shipment (P3's 131 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P7 resolution) and be visible in the next conclude message. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the observed volatility in the concluded periods while acknowledging the lead time is stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Demand has been relatively volatile (range 75-149), with a mean of approximately 115 across the first 7 periods. On-hand inventory is low (16 units), but a large in-transit pipeline (477 units) exists, which includes orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7. The OR backend needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Given the slight upward trend in recent demand (mean of last 3 periods is ~124 compared to historical ~115), I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for demand and sigma estimation to react to the more recent consumption levels while maintaining lead time at the promised/observed level of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from Period 1 to Period 4 arriving in Periods 5 to 8). Total on-hand inventory is 35 units, with 514 units in transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Historical demand shows relative stability with no significant regime shift detected yet (mean demand ~116 units, std ~27 units). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The current pipeline (514) + on-hand (35) totals 549 units, which approximately covers 4.7 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (profit/holding_cost ratio is 4:1), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting based on all 8 concluded periods (N=8) to capture the most accurate recent mean and volatility and ensure the base stock calculation by the OR backend remains responsive. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $327.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Based on the history from Period 5 through Period 9, the actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand history shows some fluctuation (ranging from 75 to 149), with the most recent 5 periods (P5-P9) averaging 115.2 units, compared to the overall average of 113.1. There is no evidence of a sustained regime shift or seasonality, as the demand appears to be stable 'Regular' chips demand. We have 49 units on hand and 486 units in transit (ordered in P6, P7, P8, P9). Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. My parameters (L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default) will allow the OR backend to use the full sample size for the most stable estimation of mean and variance, which is appropriate given the relatively short history and lack of clear structural changes.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Historical analysis shows the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by orders from Periods 1 through 6 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some variance but remains relatively stable. Using all 10 historical demand samples (Periods 1-10: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134, 109, 94, 86) gives a mean of 110.9 and a standard deviation of 25.1. With L=4, the base stock calculation needs to cover L+1 (5) periods. The current pipeline (In-transit: 366) and On-hand (124) total 490 units. Given the service level factor q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, the OR backend will calculate a base stock around (110.9 * 5) + (Z * 25.1 * sqrt(5)). I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time and 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand parameters to capture the most relevant recent distribution while filtering out the initial empty-stock noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 12. Total demand shows moderate variability with a slight downward trend over the last 5 periods (avg 86.8 vs. long-term avg 102.3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 198, which is high compared to current demand levels. However, in-transit inventory equals 270 (sum of orders from P9, P10, P11, P12). Order arrivals expected in Period 13 (from Period 9 order) is 80 units. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the demand stabilization observed since Period 6. This period, the high on-hand levels suggest the OR backend will likely reduce the order size to optimize holding costs, while L=4 ensures we cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-113.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the game history from Period 5 through Period 13. I am setting L to 'default' as it matches the observed reality. Demand was quite high in the first 5 periods (avg ~119) but has notably cooled off in the last 8 periods (average ~79). Specifically, Period 13 saw a very low demand of 33. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the $4 profit margin, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 to reflect this lower demand regime compared to the initial periods. The current on-hand inventory is high (245), and the in-transit amount (252) covers approximately three periods of incoming stock, so the OR backend should naturally reduce order quantities given these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: average demand decreased from ~119 to ~79 (-34%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 15. Historical analysis confirms a lead time of exactly 4 periods and a demand regime shift occurring around Period 6. Since Period 6, demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Comparing Period 1-5 (Avg: 117.2) to Period 6-14 (Avg: 80.7), there is a significant drop of approximately 31%. For Period 15, on-hand inventory is high (185 units) and there is a massive pipeline of 222 units (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14). To avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the lower demand regime, I will setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (P6-P14) to capture the current lower-demand environment. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has remained consistent.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 6. Pre-shift (Periods 1-5), the average demand was 117.2. Post-shift (Periods 6-15), the average demand dropped to approximately 84.0 units. Recently, demand has shown some volatility (Period 15: 113, Period 14: 101, Period 13: 33), but the 10-period average since the shift remains stable around 84. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 15). With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My current Inventory Position (On-hand 184 + In-transit 214 = 398) is quite high compared to expected demand over the lead time (5 * 84 = 420), suggesting the OR backend will place smaller orders to bleed off excess inventory and minimize holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while excluding the high-demand start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 6. Pre-Period 6 average was approximately 119, while the post-Period 6 average (up to Period 16) is approximately 89. Recent periods (P11-P16) suggest a slight rebound but with high volatility (mean ~81). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 167 units, and in-transit inventory is 299 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). To adjust to the lower demand regime and prevent excessive holding costs (holding cost is 25% of profit), I am using lead time 'calculate' (consistent at 4) and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the demand behavior since the detected regime shift in Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant shift around Period 6. From Period 1-5, the average demand was approximately 117.2 units/period. Since Period 6, the average demand has dropped to roughly 77.4 units/period (Calculated from Period 6 to 17: sum=929, n=12). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from Period 5 through 17. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 201 units and there are 276 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean of ~77, the total required stock (base stock) is roughly 385 units. Our pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 477 units, which is already above the required base stock. To calibrate the OR backend, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to focus on the current regime (Period 6-17) and 'calculate' for L since observations are stable at the promised lead time of 4.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are observing a significant and sustained downward shift in demand that began around Period 11, intensifying after Period 13. While earlier demand (Periods 6-12) averaged ~89 units, the average from Period 13 to 18 has dropped to approximately 45.67 units. This represents a secondary regime shift following the Period 6 reduction. Inventory is currently high (on-hand + pipeline exceeds needs for the promised 4-period lead time). Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs while the backend adjusts, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to lower the base stock level and reduce ordering until inventory levels normalize to the new demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift detected at Period 13: average demand decreased from ~89 (P6-P12) to ~46 (P13-P18), a ~48% reduction.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-211.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct downward shifts. The latest regime, beginning around Period 13, shows a significant drop in mean demand to approximately 46 units per period (P13-P19 average is 52.8, but the most recent 3 periods average only 23). Currently, on-hand inventory (275) plus in-transit stock (171) totals 446 units, which is extremely high given the current demand trend. In-transit arrivals from Periods 16-19 are expected to arrive in Periods 20-23. To prevent excessive holding costs, I am using 'recent_N' for demand (N=7 to capture the shift starting at Period 13) and 'calculate' for lead time, which has been consistent at 4 periods. The current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand, so the OR backend will likely order 0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-297.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two significant downward shifts. The latest shift occurred around Period 13, where demand dropped from an average of ~89 to ~46. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has dropped even further to an average of ~28 (Specifically: 54, 28, 25, 16, 20). Currently, on-hand inventory is 377 units, which is extremely high (covering over 13 periods of recent average demand). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the continued decline in demand, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current low-demand environment. This will prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while ending inventory is significantly above optimal levels. The high sigma_hat (using recent_N=5) will account for the lingering volatility from the previous regime.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime shift confirmed at Period 17: average demand further decreased from ~46 (P13-P16) to ~22 (P17-P20), a ~50% reduction.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone three distinct downward shifts, with the most recent regime starting at Period 17 showing an average demand of approximately 25.5 units (P17: 28, P18: 25, P19: 16, P20: 20, P21: 38). Current on-hand inventory is 378 units, which is extremely high (covering over 14 periods of demand at the current rate). With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a remaining pipeline of 10 units (from Period 18), the current inventory position is more than sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (P17-P21) and 'calculate' for L as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. The goal is to stop ordering until the inventory level normalizes to avoid excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-168.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple downward regime shifts, stabilizing at a much lower level. Since Period 17, demand has averaged approximately 29.2 units per period (P17-P22). Current on-hand inventory is 344 units with zero in-transit, which is extremely high relative to current demand trends. At the current rate (~30/period), the 344 units on hand represent over 11 periods of supply. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where target inventory = (1+L) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. Using L=4, target coverage should be around 5 periods (1+4). Since on-hand (344) >> target (approx 150-180), the system will naturally stop ordering. To minimize further holding costs, I am selecting the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (covering P17-P22) to accurately reflect this low-demand regime and prevent the OR engine from over-projecting demand based on older, higher data points. This will force the order quantity to 0 until inventory depletes to appropriate levels.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone three distinct downward shifts, stabilizing at a much lower level. Since Period 17, demand has averaged approximately 31.75 units per period (38, 44, 35, and the recent historical average being low). The inventory levels are currently very high (309 units on-hand) compared to this new demand regime. With a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 160 units). The current on-hand inventory of 309 units is roughly double this requirement, meaning we should not place any new orders. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 7 periods (N=7) to reflect the low-demand regime (Periods 17-23), ensuring the base stock calculation accurately mirrors current reality and prevents further ordering while we burn through excess stock. L is set to calculated as it consistently confirms the 4-period lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Over the last 4 periods (P21-P24), demand averaged 37 units per period. Since Period 17, the average is approximately 30 units. Using a lead time of L=4 (consistent with history), the system requires stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. With the current on-hand inventory at 278 units and 0 units in-transit, the pipeline total is 278. Even at the higher end of the recent demand (37 units/period), the required base stock for 5 periods is approximately 185 units (excluding safety stock). Since 278 is significantly higher than the estimated 185-200 units needed, no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect the most recent stable regime (N=8, covering periods since the last confirmed shift in P17) to allow the OR backend to naturally deplete the current excess holding before placing new orders.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime starting around Period 17. Looking at the most recent periods (P17-P25), the average demand is approximately 29.4 units per period (28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44, 35, 31, 28). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed history. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 250 units with 0 units in transit. Given the target base stock calculation [base_stock = (L+1) * mu], and using the recent average of 30 units across the 5-period horizon (L+1=5), the required base stock is approximately 150 units. Since current on-hand inventory (250) significantly exceeds the required base stock and there are no in-transit orders, the system should not place new orders. I will set L to 4, and use recent_N (N=9, covering P17-P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand environment, allowing the OR backend to drain the excess inventory.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 32 units per period (Periods 17-26: 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44, 35, 31, 28, 34). Currently, on-hand inventory is 216 units with no units in-transit. Given the lead time (L) of 4 periods, the OR backend aims for a base stock level covering L+1 = 5 periods. With the current average demand of ~32, the required inventory to cover the pipeline and lead time is roughly 160-190 units (32 * 5 + safety stock). Since the on-hand inventory of 216 already exceeds the current demand requirements for the next 5 periods, the OR policy should naturally result in zero or minimal ordering until inventory levels drop into a more efficient range. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect this current low-demand regime (Periods 17-26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 17. Over the last 11 periods (P17-P27), the average demand is 30.9 units per period. Prior shifts saw demand drop from ~119 to ~79, then to ~46, and finally to the current level (~31). Current on-hand inventory is 175 units with zero units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods and a review period of 1, the system targets covering 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~31 units/period, the target inventory (base stock) would be approximately 155 units. Since on-hand inventory (175) is already above this target and there are no units in-transit, the OR backend will correctly result in zero new orders (order = max(0, target - inventory)). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 11 periods (since Period 17) to reflect this stable low-demand state and avoid over-ordering while the system bleeds off excess stock from previous high-demand periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 17, with demand oscillating between 16 and 44 units. Over the last 12 periods (P17-P28), the average demand is approximately 32.25 units per period. With current on-hand inventory at 138 units and zero units in transit, the system is significantly overstocked relative to the current demand rate and the lead time of 4 periods. Since (1+L) periods of demand at the current average roughly equals 161 units (5 * 32.25), and we have 138 on hand, the inventory is approaching a level where a small order might soon be necessary. However, given the holding cost of $1.0 vs potential profit of $4.0, and the fact that we still have nearly 4 periods of coverage, I will continue to let the 'on-hand' deplete but shift mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime (N=12) to ensure the backend base-stock calculation is accurate for the current low-demand environment. I'll stick with the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 17-28 confirm a consistent low-demand state averaging ~32 units per period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 32.5 units per period over the last 13 periods (P17-P29). The current on-hand inventory is 105 units, and there are 35 units in-transit (ordered in Period 29, expected to arrive in Period 33). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With a target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, the base stock should cover roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current average of ~33 units, the required pipeline inventory is approximately 165 units. Current inventory (On-hand 105 + In-transit 35 = 140) is slightly below this requirement. I will use the recent 13-period window (N=13) to capture this stable low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculate method for L as the lead time has been consistently 4.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a significantly lower mean compared to the beginning of the simulation. Since Period 17, the demand has consistently averaged ~33 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 78, and there are 68 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 29 and 30). With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, the next arrival is expected in Period 33 (from the P29 order). Given the current on-hand levels and the pipeline inventory, we are well-positioned for the immediate future. I will continue to use a 'recent_N' approach with N=14 to capture the steady-state demand since the last major regime shift (Period 17), which provides enough data for stable mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 17, with a mean of approximately 32 units and low variance. Specifically, demand in the last five periods (P27-P31) has been 41, 37, 33, 27, and 33, yielding an average of 34.2. On-hand inventory is currently 45 units, and there are 93 units in-transit (ordered in P29, P30, and P31). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we expect the order from P29 to arrive in P33. The 'In-transit' balance of 93 units + 'On-hand' 45 units = 138 total units covers approximately 4 periods of demand (4 * 34.2 = 136.8). Since lead time is consistent at 4 periods, I will continue to use recent_N=15 for demand parameters to capture the post-Period 17 stability while weighting recently observed volatility appropriately. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~32 units since Period 17. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 126 units (from orders placed starting in Period 29). Based on the lead time of 4 periods, confirmed consistently in history, we expect the order from Period 29 to arrive during Period 33. The total pipeline is sufficient to cover the low-demand regime for several periods. Since on-hand + in-transit (143 units) far outweighs the expected demand over the lead time (approx 5 periods * 32 units = 160), but the OR backend's capped policy will manage the actual order quantity, I will use recent_N to capture the current stable low-demand state. N=16 covers Periods 17 through 32, representing the unified low-demand regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 17, with recent periods (P29-P33) showing an average demand of approximately 26.2 units and low volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33. Current on-hand inventory is 42 units, and the pipeline inventory is 118 units (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33), totaling 160 units. Given a lead time of 4, the target window is (L+1) = 5 periods. A base stock covering 5 periods at an average of ~27 units/period is roughly 135 units. Since total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 160, the system is currently well-stocked. I will use recent_N with N=17 (covering the entire low-demand regime since P17) to capture both the mean and the variance of this current state, ensuring the OR backend maintains a lean but safe inventory level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 17-33 confirm a consistent low-demand state averaging ~31 units per period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a low-demand regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 31 units per period. Recent demand (Periods 33-34) shows 10 and 32 units respectively. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33 and the Period 30 order in Period 34. Current on-hand inventory is 43 units, with 91 units in-transit (orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34). Given the lead time (L=4) and the need to cover demand for L+1 periods (5 periods), the total required pipeline is roughly 155 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 134 units, indicating a need for a small top-up order. I will use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable low-demand regime starting from P17. L will remain at calculate to reflect the stable 4-period lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-demand regime since Period 17, with recent demand (Periods 17-35) averaging 31.5 units and a standard deviation of 8.1. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals from orders placed in Periods 29-31. Current on-hand inventory is 24 units, and in-transit inventory is 100 units (orders from P32: 33, P33: 27, P34: 6, P35: 34). The OR backend uses a base stock policy covering (L+1) periods. Using L=4 and recent_N=19 (matching the start of the current low-demand regime at Period 17) will align the forecast with the sustained lower volume, preventing excessive overstocking while maintaining a service level informed by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 31 units per period. The recent demand history (P33-P36) shows counts of 10, 32, 44, and 10, which fluctuates around this established lower mean. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P29, P30, P31, and P32 in periods P33 through P36 respectively). Currently, on-hand inventory is 47 and in-transit is 113 (orders from P33, P34, P35, P36). Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 155-160 units). Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 160 units, which aligns perfectly with the current low-demand profile. I will continue using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=20 to capture the entirety of this stable low-demand window (P17-P36) while excluding earlier high-demand noise. Lead time will use 'calculate' as it has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 31 units and relatively low variance. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals (P29-P33 all arrived in exactly 4 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 53, and in-transit inventory is 93 (orders from P34-P37), totaling 146 units. Given the mean demand of ~31, the pipeline covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand, which is sufficient for the (L+1) horizon. I will use a recent_N of 21 (covering the stable period from P17 to P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime effectively while filtering out the high-demand volatility from the first 16 periods. This ensures the OR backend uses parameters aligned with the current market state.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since Period 17, with an average of approximately 31 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units, and there are 106 units in-transit. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (P29-P34 orders arrived exactly on schedule). Since the game ends at Period 50 and lead time is 4 periods, any orders placed now will arrive by Period 43. Given the current pipeline of 106 units and expected demand of ~31 units/period, the total inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 144) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.6 periods of demand. To optimize for the end-of-game holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer, I will use a conservative recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=20 to capture the full stable low-regime history) and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to maintain a base stock that accounts for the current low-demand stability.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 17, averaging approximately 30 units per period. Recent observations from Period 33 to Period 39 show a slight softening, with several periods recording demand in the low 10s and 20s (specifically 10, 32, 44, 10, 21, 21, 14). This suggests a possible further decline or high variance at the lower bound. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 58 and in-transit units at 93 (orders from P36-P39), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability and minor fluctuations while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-64.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in a low-volume regime that effectively began around Period 17 and has continued through the most recent periods. Since Period 33, demand has fluctuated between 8 and 44 units, with a noticeable softening in the last four periods (21, 14, 8). Currently, on-hand inventory is 96 and in-transit is 47 (orders from P37, P38, P39), totaling 143 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of approximately 25-30 units over the recent regime, 143 units of total pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover expected demand without placing a new order this period. I will use recent_N (N=20) to capture this lower demand regime (starting roughly at P21) while maintaining a safe buffer for the volatility seen in P35. L is set to calculate as 4 periods remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 33-40 show a further softening of demand, averaging ~18 units per period compared to the previous ~31, though volatility remains present.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 23 units per period (10, 32, 44, 10, 21, 21, 14, 8, 51), though Period 41 saw a spike to 51. The current on-hand inventory is 52 units, and there are 61 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 38-41). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on all recent arrivals. To prevent overstocking while covering the lead-time horizon (L+1=5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (since the P33 shift) which averages ~23 units/period, totaling 115 for the 5-period window. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture recent volatility, especially the spike in P41. Given the high pipeline relative to demand, this should prevent excessive ordering while maintaining service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 33-41 confirm a lower average demand of ~23 units per period with occasional spikes (e.g., P41), requiring a tighter base stock to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 23.3 units per period (N=10), despite a spike in Period 41. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by recent arrivals (P37 and P38 arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 39, and in-transit is 76 (Orders from P39, P41, and P42). No orders were placed in P40. The current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit = 115) is roughly 5 periods of supply at the current average (23.3 * 5 = 116.5). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. Setting mu_hat to the most recent 10 periods (N=10) captures the current stabilized low-demand regime while allowing for some variability (sigma_hat) to handle spikes like P41.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 24 units per period (sum of P33-P43 is 268 / 11 periods), although it remains volatile with occasional spikes like Period 41 (51 units). The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 25 units on hand and 90 units in transit (ordered in P40-P43), the pipeline is relatively well-stocked for this demand level. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this latest regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) without accumulating excess inventory, while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we experienced a stockout because no inventory arrived (likely due to the order from Period 40 being zero) and demand spiked to 53. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 129. The most recent demand regime (Periods 33-44) shows an average demand of approximately 28.5 units per period. The spike in Period 44 (53 units) and Period 41 (51 units) indicates a return to higher volatility within the low-demand state. Given the stockout and the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 50), I need to ensure enough inventory is ordered to cover the remaining periods while accounting for the 4-period lead time. I will use the recent 12 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean of this regime, as recent periods have shown more fluctuations than the extremely low period 40.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 33-44 is characterized by an average of ~28.5 units with significant volatility (spikes > 50 units in P41 and P44).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 46 of 50. The game ends after Period 50, meaning no orders placed after Period 46 (which arrive in Period 50) will contribute to sales. The demand regime from Period 33 onwards has stabilized at an average of approximately 28.5 units, but with significant volatility (spikes > 50 in P41 and P44). In Period 44, we experienced a stockout due to a demand spike and a delay in arrival (the P40 order of 0 units meant nothing arrived in P44). Period 45 saw a recovery with 21 units arriving, leaving 2 units on-hand. There are 148 units in-transit: orders from P42 (34), P43 (35), P44 (39), and P45 (40). These are scheduled to arrive in P46, P47, P48, and P49 respectively. Given the 50-period limit, these in-transit units already cover the expected demand for the remaining periods (approx 4 periods * 28.5 units = 114 units). Placing a large order now would likely result in excess inventory at the end of the game, incurring unnecessary holding costs. I will maintain L at the promised 4 periods and set mu_hat using recent_N (N=13) to capture the current demand regime (~28 units/period * 5 periods). sigma_hat will also use recent_N to account for the recent spikes.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 33 has stabilized at an average of approximately 28.5 units per period (sum of demands from P33 to P46 is 371; 371/14 \u2248 26.5), albeit with significant volatility including spikes up to 53. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 47 is approaching the game end (Period 50), the key is to ensure enough stock to cover the final periods without over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 to capture the current demand regime since P33, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=14 to account for the recent volatility (spikes). For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as it has been consistently 4 units. On-hand is 13, and in-transit is 128 (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). Expected arrivals are: P47: 35 (from P43), P48: 39 (from P44), P49: 40 (from P45), P50: 14 (from P46). The pipeline is well-stocked for the remaining 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 33, averaging approximately 27.4 units per period (Periods 33-47). Recent spikes in Period 41 (51 units) and Period 44 (53 units) indicate high volatility relative to this mean, requiring a robust sigma to prevent stockouts while the low mean prevents excessive holding costs. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), orders placed now (P48) will arrive in P52 (beyond the game end). Therefore, the primary objective is to manage the current on-hand inventory (17 units) and the significant pipeline (114 units) already scheduled to arrive in P48 (from P44), P49 (from P45), P50 (from P46), and P51 (from P47). Given the current pipeline of 114 units and only 3 demand periods left, we are heavily overstocked. I am setting parameters to reflect the most recent regime (N=15, since P33) to allow the OR backend to accurately calculate base stock, although the capping mechanism will likely result in small or zero orders as the system seeks to deplete the existing pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 17, with a the most recent sub-regime (starting Period 33) averaging approximately 29 units per period. In Period 48, demand spiked to 56 units, which exhausted the on-hand inventory. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 106 units in transit. Specifically, the order from Period 45 (40 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 49 (Lead Time = 4). Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.8, which targets a high service level. However, given that Period 49 is the penultimate period and Period 50 is the final period, the OR backend's capped policy will naturally limit excessive ordering. I will use the last 16 samples (N=16, from Period 33 onwards) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, ensuring the pipeline is sufficient to cover the final two periods without excessive stock-out risk or residual holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a volatile low-demand regime. Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 28.5 units, but with significant variability, including spikes like Period 48 (56 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand 10 + in-transit 121 = 131) is being managed to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%. I will use recent_N (N=17, covering the Period 33-49 regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent mean and volatility accurately while ignoring the high-demand data from the beginning of the game. This ensures we have enough stock for the spikes (like the 56 units seen recently) without over-accumulating inventory during lower-demand periods (~10-20 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 33-49 is confirmed at an average of ~28.6 units with significant volatility (std dev ~14), requiring higher safety stock than the previous Period 17-33 low-demand state.
