Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the promised lead time is 4 periods, I must place an order that covers demand for the current period and the lead-time duration (L+1 = 5 periods). Calculated requirement: 106 units/period * 5 periods = 530 units.

The pipeline of 550 units covers approximately 5 periods of demand (550 / 110 = 5). Since the lead time is 4 periods, I need to ensure coverage for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). The 550 units already in transit should satisfy this requirement. However, to maintain a continuous pipeline and account for the demand in Period 6 (the first period after the current pipeline arrives), I should start placing incremental orders. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), I must be careful not to overstock. I'll order a quantity close to the expected mean demand to keep the pipeline moving without creating excessive surplus, adjusted for the fact that I am currently out of stock and will be for several periods.",

As of Period 46, we have 1 unit on-hand and 390 units in-transit. The game ends at Period 50, meaning no orders placed after Period 46 will arrive (Period 46 order arrives at Period 50 arrival resolution). My objective is to satisfy demand for the remaining 5 periods (46, 47, 48, 49, 50). Total expected demand for these 5 periods is 500 units. Current inventory + Pipeline = 1 + 390 = 391 units. Specifically, the in-transit units are from orders in P42(110), P43(85), P44(90), P45(105), totaling 390. These will arrive in Periods 46 through 49. To maximize profit and minimize ending inventory at P50, I need to order enough to cover P50's demand and any deficit. Total units needed to cover Periods 46-50 = 500. Total available = 391. Difference = 109 units. Ordering 109 units now (Period 46) will result in them arriving in Period 50, exactly when needed to satisfy the final period's demand without leaving excessive stock.",

Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed in Period 48, 49, and 50 will never arrive to satisfy demand or contribute to sales. Ordering now would only incur inventory costs if they arrived, but since they arrive after the game ends, they are irrelevant for sales. However, looking at the pipeline: arrivals for P48 (ordered P44: 90 units), P49 (ordered P45: 105 units), and P50 (ordered P46: 109 units) are already in transit. Historical demand is stable around ~100. P48 Pipeline (90) + On-hand (2) = 92, which nearly covers avg demand.

Because the game ends after Period 50's demand phase, any new orders placed now or in the final period will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the profit/loss of the simulation. My current pipeline consists of orders from Periods 45 (105 units), 46 (109 units), 47 (0), and 48 (0).
