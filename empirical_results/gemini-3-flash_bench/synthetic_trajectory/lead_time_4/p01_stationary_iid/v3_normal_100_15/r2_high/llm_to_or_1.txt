Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $19.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, we should aim for a high service level. The demand history provided (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) shows an average demand of approximately 106.4 units per period with a standard deviation of about 17.5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the characteristics of the initial provided demand samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The sample demand history (P1-P5) and the first period's performance (demand=90) suggest a stable demand around 100-110 units. In Period 1, we ordered 136 units, which is currently in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we expect this order to arrive in the 'conclude' message of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 1 (sold=0 for demand=90). We need to maintain a pipeline that covers L+1 periods of demand. Since we only have one period of actual game history, but five samples of historical data, I will use a conservative estimate based on the provided historical samples (mean \u2248 106, std \u2248 18). The OR backend uses (1+L) calculation. I will set L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the provided historical distribution while the game data begins to accumulate.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed 2 periods, no orders are expected to have arrived yet (Period 1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5). On-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for the first two periods (demand was 90 and 106). In-transit inventory is 271 (136 from P1 + 135 from P2). Historical demand samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) and actual demand in P1 (90) and P2 (106) suggest a mean around 105. Given a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 19/20 = 0.95. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (using the provided historical samples) to stabilize the forecast against the current slightly higher actual demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4). Based on the history, we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost sales (sold=0 while demand > 0) due to initial lead time delay. Total in-transit is 388 (136 + 135 + 117). The demand across the first 3 periods (90, 106, 102) averages 99.3. Including the additional historical samples provided (88, 133, 93, 108, 110), the mean is approximately 103.75 with a standard deviation of 14.5. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most relevant recent patterns (N=5) and stick to the promised lead time 'default' as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period (1+4)=5's arrival resolution and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and all previous orders (P1: 136, P2: 135, P3: 117, P4: 117) are correctly in-transit (total 505). Demand has been relatively stable, with recorded samples of 88, 133, 93, 108, 110 (mean \u2248 106.4). Since no shipments have 'concluded' yet, I cannot confirm an actual lead time shift, so I will stick with the promised L=4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the initial demand profile. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1524.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 90, 106, 102, 117, 83 (Mean: 99.6, Std: 12.8). The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the actual lead time is exactly 4. Pipeline inventory (135 + 117 + 117 + 57 = 426) is on track. On-hand inventory is 53. Since L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My target base stock is approximately (4+1) * 100 = 500. Currently, On-hand + In-transit = 53 + 426 = 479. The OR engine will naturally order the difference (~21 units) given the parameters. I will use 'default' for L as the promised lead time is accurate, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the stable mean and volatility observed so far.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Demand stable around 100 units/period.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are observing the stock for 'chips(Regular)'. Analyzing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2). Current on-hand inventory is 132 units with 360 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand history shows some fluctuations: P1-P4 averaged 104 units, but P5-P6 averaged only 69.5 units. Given the short history of 6 periods, there is not yet enough evidence to declare a sustained downward demand regime, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent sample set. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the confirmed 4-period lead time. Parameters are designed to maintain a high service level (profit/holding ratio is 19:1) while accounting for the current sizeable pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1731.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable; the mean demand across the first 7 periods is approximately 93.3 units. Recent demand (Periods 5-7) shows a slight dip (avg 79.3), but historical samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) suggest a higher long-term average. Given the current on-hand inventory (150) and a significant pipeline (292), the system is well-buffered for the lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the overall demand level while acknowledging the recent stability. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will use these to maintain the target base stock, accounting for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 periods total).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1493.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 9. Analysis of historical arrivals (P5-P8) confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand across the first 8 periods has been relatively stable, with a mean of 92.6 units and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5 units. The on-hand inventory is currently high (179 units) due to the arrival of previous large orders (Period 3 and 4 orders), and there are 273 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5-8). My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). Given the stability, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters to capture the full operational history since the first order arrived, as this provides a reliable basis for forecasting while ignoring the pre-arrival demand samples if necessary, though here the full history is consistent. This will help the OR backend balance the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1) to maintain an appropriate service level.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation period is 10. Based on the history from Period 1 to Period 9, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods (matches promised). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of approximately 93 units per period (last 9 periods range from 56 to 117). Total in-transit is 295 (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9), and on-hand is 142. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N for mu and sigma (N=9) reflects the stable but fluctuating demand observed since start. No shipments are missing; arrivals for P6, P7, P8, and P9 are expected in P10, P11, P12, and P13 respectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2389.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from Periods 1 through 6). The actual demand for chips(Regular) has stayed relatively stable, with values ranging from 56 to 130 in the last 10 periods. The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 96.3. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we must cover demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Current pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 317 units and on-hand is 81, totaling 398 units. This covers roughly 4.1 periods of average demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (mean ~96.3), and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as the promised lead time is accurate and volatility is standard.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (matches promise). Demand has remained relatively stable, though it has seen a slight uptick recently (Period 10: 130, Period 11: 104). On-hand inventory is currently low (26 units), but there is a significant amount in transit (397 units) following the lead-time pipeline. Specifically, the order from Period 8 (98 units) should arrive during Period 12, Period 9 (79 units) in Period 13, and so on. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The historical mean demand is approximately 97 units per period. I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the recent slight increase in variance and mean, while keeping lead time at the default (promised) value of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with an average of approximately 96 units over the last 7 periods (P6-P12). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 428 units, and on-hand inventory is 42 units. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Historical demand mean is approx 100, so a base stock should be around 500 units. The current total inventory (42 + 428 = 470) is slightly below this target. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both demand mean and volatility to capture the most stable recent regime and avoid early-game variability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, with the last 13 periods showing an average of approximately 96 units/period (ranging from 56 to 130). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 9. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (24), but the in-transit pipeline is significant (429), covering orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13. Given the Lead Time (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~100, the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) should be around 500-600 units to maintain the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Current inventory position is 453. I will utilize 'recent_N' for demand (N=13) to capture the stable post-initialization pattern and keep L as 'default' (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2085.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from Period 5 through Period 14). Demand has remained relatively stable, with the most recent 10-period mean (P5-P14) being approximately 95 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently very low (5 units), while the in-transit pipeline (432 units) includes orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14. An arrival (from P11) is expected during the current Period 15. To maintain the service level across the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I will use the recent mean demand (approx 95) and standard deviation of recent periods to set the OR parameters. I choose recent_N with N=10 to filter out the initial high-demand noise and focus on the current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1826.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 36 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P11 arrived in P15, we expect orders from P12 (129 units), P13 (80 units), P14 (94 units), and P15 (107 units) to arrive in Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19 respectively. The total in-transit is 410, which matches the sum of these outstanding orders (129+80+94+107=410). Demand has remained stable throughout the history (P1-15 avg \u2248 97.2). There is no evidence of a regime shift or seasonal spike yet. I will continue using a lead time of 4 and use the most recent 10 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable demand environment while excluding the initial warm-up period variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1795.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 97 units per period across all 16 periods (avg: 96.69). All observed lead times have been exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current pipeline inventory (385 units) plus on-hand inventory (67 units) totals 452 units. This covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) at an average demand of ~90.4 units/period, which is slightly below the recent average. To maintain a safe service level and account for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), I am using 'recent_N' for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the stable but slightly higher demand seen in the most recent 10 periods. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4pd historical lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1933.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 18. Historical data shows that the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 13's order arrived at the end of Period 17). Demand remains stable with no significant evidence of regime shifts; recent demand samples (P13-P17) are 97, 110, 98, 98, and 104, averaging 101.4. The overall mean since Period 1 is approximately 97.4. Given the stability, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reinforce the observed 4-period lead time and 'recent_N' with N=17 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full scope of the stable 'Regular chips' demand while discarding only the initial seed samples. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (1+L) periods, balancing the high profit margin ($19.0) against the low holding cost ($1.0).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, with an average of approximately 102 units over the last 8 periods (Periods 11-18). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrival messages from P5 to P18. Currently, there are 21 units on-hand and 410 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). The target coverage for the OR backend needs to account for (L+1) periods of demand to prevent stockouts while balancing holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters to capture the current stable regime and 'calculate' for lead time since the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable throughout the 19 concluded periods, consistently averaging around 100 units per period. The lead time is also rock-solid at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving exactly when expected from Period 1 through Period 15. Currently, the on-hand inventory is low (16 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 415 units. Since the lead time and demand profiles show no signs of shifting, I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the stable mean and variance of this long, consistent regime. Given the lead time (L=4) is perfectly aligned with the promised value, the 'default' method for L is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 21. Looking at the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-20). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 434 units in-transit. Demand has shown a slight upward trend and increased volatility in recent periods (e.g., P18-P20 demand was 116, 112, 121), compared to the earlier average of around 100. Because we just hit a stockout (sold 120 while demand was 121 in P20), I need to ensure the base stock covers current demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (approx 103) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This will set the pipeline target to (1+L) = 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand increased from ~95 (P1-10) to ~105 (P11-20), with a recent peak of 121 in P20 leading to a minor stockout.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight upward trend, shifting from an average of ~95 (P1-P10) to ~105 (P11-P21). Period 20 saw a peak of 121 units which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), and Period 21 ended with only 1 unit on hand. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and verified by historical arrival data (most recent arrival P21 from order P17). Given the recent demand increase and the proximity to stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=11 (P11-P21) to capture the higher mean and variance of the current regime. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand levels to prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs against the $19 profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1957.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P18-P22) has consistently hovered around 104-112 units, confirming a sustained shift from the previous average of 95. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to demand exceeding supply in P22. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have experienced two stockouts in the last three periods (P20 and P22), a more responsive demand forecast is required. I will use a recent_N (N=10) window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-volume, higher-volatility regime (approx 105 units/period) while ignoring the lower demand from the first 10 periods. L is set to calculate as the observed lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from P11-P22 is ~103 units, compared to ~94 units in P1-P10. Volatility has also increased, leading to frequent stockouts when on-hand inventory is low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1608.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent regime shift starting around Period 11. Analysis of Period 1-10 shows an average demand of approximately 95 units, whereas Period 11-23 averages approximately 101 units, with higher volatility (standard deviation increasing from ~19 to ~21). The critical lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by consistent arrivals in the history. Current on-hand inventory is low (26 units). To protect against recent stockouts and ensure a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical ratio ~0.95), I am using 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=13 to capture the entire new regime since Period 11. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the elevated demand and increased variance over the review + lead time period (L+1=5).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 25. Historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Analysis of demand regimes reveals an upward shift: from Period 1-10, mean demand was approximately 98.6 units (including samples from before the start of history provided in the prompt), and from Period 11-24, it rose to approximately 102.6 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P21-P24) show an average demand of 96.75, but the system recently experienced stockouts (P20, P22) indicating that the current base stock calculation may be too lean given the increased volatility. In-transit inventory is 404 units, which is roughly 4 periods of demand, aligning correctly with L=4. To ensure a high service level while the demand fluctuates around this new level, I will use recent_N with N=14 (representing the second regime) for demand mean and volatility, while keeping L at the calculated default of 4. This allows the backend to capture the sustained higher mean and variance seen since Period 11.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P21-P25) shows figures of 96, 105, 86, 100, and 86. While earlier periods (P18-P20) saw a spike up to 121, the last five periods have averaged 94.6 units. This suggests the previously noted 'upward shift' may have stabilized or reverted toward the long-term mean. I will set N=10 for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime which reflects this moderate volatility and prevents over-ordering based on the P20 peak. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals, so 'default' (promised lead time) is appropriate. Sigma_hat is set to default to ensure a broader sample of volatility is considered to protect against the frequent stockouts observed in the Period 21-23 window.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P11-P26) shows an average demand of approximately 100 units per period, which is slightly higher than the initial phase but lower than the peak encountered around P20. Specifically, looking at the last 6 periods (P21-P26), demand has averaged 92.3 units, indicating a potential cooling from the previous surge. However, to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), I will use a N=15 lookback window (covering the current regime since P11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the recent stability with the period of higher volatility seen recently. The lead time (L) is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory (102) plus in-transit stock (386) total 488 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of forecasted demand (approx 100 * 5 = 500), so no aggressive correction is needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1712.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system is operating within a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since the demand shift was noted around Period 21 (increasing from ~95 to ~105), recent data (P21-P27) shows mean demand is approximately 93 units, which is slightly lower than the P11-P20 average but higher than the initial phase. Therefore, I will use a window of recent_N=17 (P11-P27) to capture the higher volatility and mean demand observed since Period 11, ensuring we have enough buffer. Lead time L is consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is healthy (112) and in-transit (335) covers the next several periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N=17 will balance the slightly elevated demand and the need for a safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 20 and 22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2190.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P23-P28) shows mean demand is approximately 95 units, contrasting with the slightly higher volatility seen in P28 (119 units). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P11, we have observed a regime where demand fluctuates between 80 and 120 units. To balance the relatively high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1), a service level of approximately 95% is targeted. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to cover the regime starting around Period 11, which captures the shift described in previous Carry-Over Insights (mean ~103 units across P11-P22) while including current fluctuations. This stabilizes the forecast against the local variability observed in the last few periods (e.g., the drop in P25-P26 followed by the spike in P28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1832.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the regime established around Period 21-23. Since Period 21, demand has averaged approximately 99 units per period (P21-P29: 96, 105, 86, 100, 86, 81, 96, 119, 100). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5-P29). There are no missing shipments; the 'In-transit' quantity of 374 units aligns with orders placed in Periods 26 (105), 27 (55), 28 (93), and 29 (121). Given the current on-hand inventory of 68 and the high critical ratio (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1) = 0.95), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use a recent_N of 9 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable regime and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (119 in P28 vs 81 in P26). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the confirmed historical average of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2027.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-30). Demand has shown a sustained higher level since Period 11. Analyzing the most recent 20 periods (P11-P30), the average demand is approximately 101.5 units per period. Comparing this to the first 10 periods (~95 units), the shift is consistently maintained. Reviewing the last 10 periods (P21-P30) specifically, the average is 98.9 units, but volatility remains significant with peaks like 119 in P28. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the inventory policy should lean towards high service levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime's mean and variability while smoothing out noise. On-hand inventory is 63, and in-transit is 364, which combined (427) covers roughly 4.2 periods of the current average demand, aligning well with the (L+1)=5 period requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P11 to P30 is stable at a higher mean of ~102 units compared to the initial ~95 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 34 units, with a pipeline (in-transit) of 430 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (order placed in P27 arrived in P31). Based on carry-over insights and historical data from P11 onward, the demand has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 102 units compared to the early period mean of 95. In the most recent 10 periods (P22-P31), the mean demand is 96.7, though there were peaks upwards of 119-121 in P28-P29. Reconciling the pipeline: orders from P28 (93), P29 (121), P30 (95), and P31 (121) are in-transit, totaling 430 units. Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher demand regime that began around P11, balancing the recent slight softening with the overall higher level of volatility seen in this regime.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand has been stable in a higher regime of approximately 102 units since Period 11, with recent periods (P21-P32) continuing this trend. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 45 units, and in-transit inventory is 419 units, which includes 4 pending orders (P29, P30, P31, P32). An order from P29 is expected to arrive during P33. To maintain a high service level against the current demand mean and volatility while avoiding excess holding costs, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current regime's characteristics (P13-P32). The lead time parameter is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2294.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand analysis from Period 11 to Period 33 shows a stable but higher mean demand of approximately 100.8 units per period compared to the initial periods. The most recent demand in Period 33 was significantly higher at 123 units, suggesting that while the long-term average remains stable, volatility persists. In-transit inventory is currently 380 units, reflecting orders from Periods 30, 31, 32, and 33 (95+121+82+82 = 380). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the higher average demand and the need to protect against stockouts (critical for maximizing profit with a $19/unit margin vs. $1/unit holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility. I'll set N=23 to cover the entire current regime (P11-P33) to capture the stable mean and the observed variance within this established pattern.

LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 61 units with 407 units in-transit. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by P30 order arriving in P34). Demand has reached a higher plateau since roughly Period 11. Specifically, over the last 20 periods (P15-P34), demand averages approximately 99 units with a standard deviation of 14 units. Over the more recent 10 periods (P25-P34), the average is 97.9 units. There is no significant seasonal signal or trend detected in the 'chips(Regular)' description. I will use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Lead time remains 'calculate' because the observations are consistently 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable following the regime shift identified around Period 11. Over the last 25 periods (P11-P35), the average demand is approximately 100 units per period (Avg=100.28, Std Dev=13.0). The lead time has been consistently 4 periods as observed in all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 89 units with 369 units in-transit (orders from P32-P35), providing a healthy pipeline coverage for the (L+1) window. I will use recent_N with N=25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, higher-demand regime while excluding the lower initial demand from the first 10 periods. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the highly consistent 4-period observations.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 79 units, with 374 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods and the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P32 order arriving in P36). Demand has been relatively stable, with a slight upward regime shift noted since Period 11. Specifically, from P31 to P36, demand has averaged 91.83 units, which is slightly lower than the P11-P30 average of ~102 units, but consistent with general fluctuations. I will use N=26 (P11-P36) to capture the higher demand regime established after Period 10 while maintaining stability in the forecast. Using L=default reflects the stable 4-period lead time. Mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 26 periods to align with the detected demand shift while ensuring sufficient stock to cover the review plus lead time (5 periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since Period 11, with occasional peaks up to 123. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrival data. Currently, on-hand inventory is 57, and in-transit units amount to 382. We are in Period 38 of 50. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 20 periods (roughly Period 18 to 37) to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime. Specifically, N=20 incorporates the recent fluctuations (77 to 123 demand range) which ensures the safety stock is appropriately sized to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at a higher mean since Period 11. Over the last 20 periods (P19-P38), the average daily demand is approximately 99.6 units, which is consistent with the 'carry_over_insight' noted at Period 31. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38. Current on-hand inventory (65) plus in-transit stock (370) totals 435 units, which covers approximately 4.36 periods of demand (at ~100 units/period). Given the 4-period lead time, we need to ensure the pipeline covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 will accurately capture the current stable but slightly higher demand regime and its volatility, allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock level while accounting for the profit/holding cost balance.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been stable since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units/period (average from P11 to P39 is 98.7). Current on-hand inventory is 56, and there are 400 units in-transit (P36-P39 orders). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is directed at maintaining enough inventory to cover the lead time plus one period (L+1=5) based on the stable mean demand and moderate volatility observed in the last 20 periods. I am using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current demand regime, which provides a better balance than the total history.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable around the previously identified higher mean. Analyzing the last 30 periods (P11-P40) yields an average demand of approximately 99 units per period. The lead time consistently remains at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 40 originating from Period 36. Current on-hand inventory is 33 units, with a pipeline of 399 units (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40 totaling 399 units, all within the lead time window). The formula (1+L) requires 5 periods of demand coverage. With L=4 and an average demand of ~99, the base stock target is approximately 500 units. Pipeline (399) + On-hand (33) = 432 units, suggesting an order of around 68 units will be placed by the OR backend. I will use recent_N with N=30 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 11.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the higher regime identified around Period 21. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P32-P41), the average demand is 98.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 13.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, Period 42 starts with 25 units on-hand and 423 units in transit. Since L=4, my parameters need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable-but-elevated demand profile while maintaining a safe service level for this high-margin (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1) item.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the higher regime identified in Period 31. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the average demand is 101.5 units, which is consistent with the Carry-over Insight of ~102 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current inventory is healthy: on-hand is 50, and 411 units are in-transit, which covers more than 4 periods of the current demand rate (~102 * 4 = 408). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable higher demand regime (covering Periods 23 to 42), and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=20 to represent recent volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P31-P43) remains stable with a mean of approximately 96.5 units, which is slightly lower than the previous regime but still consistent. Lead time is reliably 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 65 and 369 units in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand characteristics without overreacting to individual fluctuations. This approach balances the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excessive ending inventory as we approach the end of the simulation (P50).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable in the current regime (P31-P44) with a mean of approximately 98.4 units and a standard deviation of 14.1. Lead time has consistently stayed at the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently at 40 units with 381 units in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). Given that the game ends at Period 50 and lead time is 4 periods, an order placed today (P45) will arrive in Period 49. This is the penultimate period. To ensure we cover demand for the remaining 6 periods (including the current one) while minimizing holding cost at the game's end, I will use recent statistics (N=14) to capture the current stable regime. The base stock level will aim to cover demand through Period 49, and the pipeline (381 units) already accounts for most of this, which ensures the OR backend will place a conservative order to avoid excess ending inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P31 to P44 is stable with a mean of ~98 units (standard deviation ~14.1). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 31, with a mean of approximately 98.7 units and a standard deviation of 12.9 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. We are currently at Period 46 of 50, meaning we have five periods of the game remaining (P46, P47, P48, P49, P50). Since any order placed now (L=4) will arrive in Period 50 (N+L), it is the last order that can arrive before the game ends. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 383) plus current on-hand (47) equals 430 units. Given a mean demand of ~99, expected demand over the remaining 5 periods is ~495 units. The current inventory position is slightly below the expected total demand, so a moderate order is justified to minimize stockout risk in the final period. I will use a recent window (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 31 to 46 remains stable around a mean of approximately 98.7 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 13.9. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 46 of the order placed in Period 42. Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=16 (covering the stable regime since P31) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure that parameters reflect the current demand distribution accurately. We are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50), and since lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P47) would ideally arrive in Period 51, which is outside the 50-period horizon. However, to maintain service levels for the remaining periods (48-50) based on existing pipeline inventory, continuing the current logic is safest to avoid stockouts in the final stages.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. Demand has been stable since Period 31, with a mean of approximately 98-100 units. Recent periods (P41-P47) show demand of 107, 82, 112, with no significant trend shift. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P47 (ordered in P43). Current on-hand inventory is 22 units, and pipeline inventory is 401 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, P47). Given we are near the end of the simulation, we aim to maintain a service level that satisfies demand without excessive holding costs for the final periods. I will use recent_N=17 for demand (covering P31-P47) to capture the current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 is the penultimate period. The current 'on-hand' inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 48 (demand 124 vs supply 120). There are 420 units in-transit, which accounts for orders placed in Periods 45 (116 units), 46 (109 units), 47 (78 units), and 48 (117 units). These are expected to arrive in Periods 49, 50, 51, and 52 respectively. Since the game ends at Period 50, only the arrivals for Period 49 and Period 50 are relevant. We expect 116 units to arrive during Period 49 and 109 units during Period 50. Demand has shown a slight upward trend or high volatility recently (111, 107, 82, 112, 124 since Period 44). I will use the recent regime (last 18 periods since Period 31) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the mean of ~99 and standard deviation of ~14. This balanced approach ensures we cover demand in the final two periods without excessive overstocking, although 'cap' logic in the OR backend usually prevents excessive late-game ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1444.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P45-P49) has shown a slightly higher mean (~101 units) and increased volatility, with a spike of 124 in P48 leading to a stockout. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 428 covers the expected demand for the next 4 periods (L=4 implies target coverage for L+1 = 5 periods, or ~500 units). Current on-hand is low (38). To account for the recent demand surge and variance, I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the latest fluctuations more accurately than the long-term history while providing enough smoothing to avoid over-reacting to the P48 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P41 to P49 shows a mean of ~100.5 and higher volatility compared to P31-P40, requiring a more responsive sigma_hat calculation.
