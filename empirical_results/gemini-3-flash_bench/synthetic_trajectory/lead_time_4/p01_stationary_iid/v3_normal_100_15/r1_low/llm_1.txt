My ordering strategy must cover the lead-time pipeline plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since currently in Period 1 (with P1-P5 history provided), I need to account for the demand that will occur during the 4-period lead time. Target inventory should be approximately Mean * (L+1) plus a safety stock to handle variance. 106 * 5 = 530. With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order a significant amount to establish a buffer. However, as holding cost is equal to profit ($1.0), overstaying inventory is costly. I will start by ordering enough to cover the expected demand for the lead time duration to ensure availability when the shipment arrives in Period 5/6.",

Thus, Period 45 is the final period to place an order that can be sold. My inventory position is: On-hand = 198. In-transit = 320 (from P41, P42, P44). Breakdown of expected arrivals: Period 45: 110 (from P41), Period 46: 100 (from P42), Period 47: 0 (no order P43), Period 48: 110 (from P44). Total inventory available to cover periods 45-50 (approx 600 units of demand) is 198 (on-hand) + 320 (in-transit) = 518 units. To avoid stockouts in the final periods while minimizing ending inventory (given the $1/unit holding cost), I need to cover the remaining ~82 units shortfall. I will order 80 units.",

  "rationale": "The current period is 46 out of 50. With a lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now (Period 46) would arrive at the start of Period 51 (Period 50 conclude), making it effectively the last useful order for satisfying Period 50 demand. Subsequent orders (Period 47-50) will arrive after the game ends and only contribute to holding costs or be irrelevant. The objective is to maximize profit (sold units) while minimizing ending inventory (holding costs). Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, averaging ~100 units per period. Pipeline Status: On-hand (217) + In-transit (290) = 507 total units available for the remaining 5 periods (46, 47, 48, 49, 50). Total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 500 units. Since the current pipeline (507) already covers the forecasted total demand (500) through Period 50, placing a large order now is unnecessary and would likely result in excess ending inventory. I will place a small order of 80 units to ensure a tight buffer against stockouts in Period 50, considering the ending on-hand inventory should ideally be near zero at the end of Period 50.",

Consequently, current on-hand inventory and items already in-transit are the only resources available to satisfy demand for the remaining periods (48, 49, and 50). Current on-hand inventory is 126 units. In-transit inventory includes 110 units from P44 (expected to arrive in P48 conclude/P49 start), 80 units from P45 (expected P49 conclude/P50 start), and 80 units from P46 (expected P50 conclude/P51 start). Note: the P46 order arrives after the final demand of P50 is resolved. Therefore, available supply for the remaining periods is 126 (current) + 110 (P44) + 80 (P45) = 316 units. The historical average demand is ~100 units/period. The total expected demand for periods 48, 49, and 50 is ~300 units. Since 316 units are already in the pipeline or on-hand, we have sufficient inventory to cover demand without incurring additional holding costs for units that arrive after the game ends.

These arrivals happen after the game ends. Therefore, my goal is to maximize profit from existing on-hand inventory and the remaining in-transit stock that will arrive before Period 50 concludes. Currently, there are 131 units on-hand. The in-transit units (160) consist of orders from P45 (80 units) and P46 (80 units).

Current on-hand inventory is 99 units. Historical demand has consistently averaged around 100 units per period (recent average ~101 units over last 10 periods). Since any order placed today will arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time) and the simulation ends at Period 50, any new order would only incur holding costs or simply never arrive before the game concludes.
