Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there are no previous arrivals to evaluate, I will use the promised lead time (L=4). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) yields an average of 93 units per period. For Period 1, I need to set parameters based on the lead-time plus one period (L+1 = 5). Using the average demand of 93, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 465 units. Given the high variance in the initial samples (std \u2248 38), the OR backend will calculate a base stock level that balances the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) according to the Critical Ratio (0.50). Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, this will trigger an initial order to cover the pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 156 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect arrivals until the 'Period 5 conclude' message (visible at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [143, 103, 39, 81, 99], with a mean of 93. I will use the mean of all 5 historical samples as the demand forecast. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the review plus lead time period is (1+L) = 5 periods. Therefore, mu_hat = 5 * 93 = 465. Given the high volatility (std dev \u2248 38), sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 38 \u2248 85. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock level. I will set L to 'default' as we have no evidence yet to contradict the promised lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (156 units) and Period 2 (156 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 312 units. No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected as the earliest arrival (ordered Period 1, lead time 4) would be Period 5. Demand samples for P1 and P2 were 143 (initially provided history) and 103 respectively. However, the 'conclude' message for Period 1 shows a demand of 38, while history says 143. Reconciling history: P1=143, P2=103, P3=39, P4=81, P5=99. Wait, the user prompt provides demand samples and also 'Period conclude' demand. I will prioritize the 'Period conclude' demand for the most recent periods. P1 demand was 38 (conclude), P2 demand was 103 (conclude). The average demand of available samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) is 93. Based on L=4, the base stock should cover (1+4)=5 periods. 5 * 93 = 465. Since on-hand + in-transit = 312, the backend needs to order to reach the base stock. I will use 'default' for L to stick to promised 4 periods, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to bridge the provided history and actuals.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (156 units), Period 2 (156 units), and Period 3 (48 units) are all still in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1-3 because no stock was available. Historical demand samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) show high volatility (mean ~93, std ~40). Since no orders have concluded yet, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history, providing a base stock calculation covering (1+L)=5 periods of demand. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the significant variance observed in the initial samples.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (156 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 404 units in-transit (Orders from P1: 156, P2: 156, P3: 48, P4: 44). Demand has been volatile (P1: 38, P2: 103, P3: 83, P4: 0, P5: 99). Note: The historical demand data provided in the prompt (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) differs slightly from the Game History log; I will prioritize the Game History log for calculation as it reflects the specific environment state. The mean demand across the first 5 periods is approximately 64.6. Since we have not yet confirmed any actual lead times (first arrival expected end of P5), I will use the promised lead time (L=4). I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the initial variance in these early periods. This ensures the base stock covers (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we saw the first arrival (ordered P1, arrived P5), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Historical demand samples are [143, 103, 39, 81, 99] (from the list) and the conclude messages report demands [38, 103, 83, 0, 152]. There is significant discrepancy between the provided historical samples and the 'conclude' message demand figures. I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data for the recent regime. The average demand across the 5 concluded periods is (38+103+83+0+152)/5 = 75.2 units/period. The standard deviation is approximately 58. Current on-hand is 4 and in-transit is 248. Total pipeline is 252. For L=4, mu_hat (1+L)*mean should be ~5 * 75.2 = 376. Sigma_hat should be sqrt(5)*58 ~ 130. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent volatility while the backend calculates the stats from the history provided in the conclude messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 34 units on-hand and 216 units in-transit. The history confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand has been volatile: [38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126] - note that Period 4 was recorded as 0 but this might be an anomaly or data error given the surrounding periods. Excluding P4, the average demand is approximately 100 units/period. Period 1 demand was actually 143 in the provided stats block but the Game History says 38 (likely due to stockouts/resolution timing). Using the last 5 demand samples [103, 39, 81, 99, 126] for forecasting, with L=4, the backend needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat calculation: (1+4) * average(last 5) = 5 * 89.6 = 448. However, recent demand (P5, P6) shows upward momentum. To remain safe against stockouts while managing holding cost (which equals profit), I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand and sigma, and default for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing the history, the orders from Period 1 (arrived P5), Period 2 (arrived P6), and Period 3 (arrived P7) all arrived exactly in 4 periods. Thus, the actual lead time is currently stable and aligns with the promised 4 periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been volatile: 38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51 (averaging ~79). There was a period of 0 demand (P4) followed by a peak (P5-P6). I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the more current demand level (avg ~82) while ignoring the initial noise. Setting L to default (4) as observations confirm it. I'll use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to balance the high variance seen in periods 5-7 against the lower demand in period 7.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the item 'chips(Regular)' has 0 on-hand inventory and 337 units in transit. Reviewing the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). The demand has been volatile, with the most recent sample in Period 8 being 85 units, but the previous samples since Period 5 were 152, 126, and 51. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P5-P8) is 103.5. Using the backend formula for base stock where L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this recent demand regime (avg ~103.5 * 5 = 517.5). Given the variability (sigma), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to calculate appropriate safety stock for the current volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Based on this, the order from Period 5 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival in Period 9. The order from Period 6 (124 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 10 and be visible in Period 11's start. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a shift: Periods 1-4 had a mean of 56, while Periods 5-9 (excluding 0-demand anomalies) show a higher level of activity, though Period 9 had 0 sales due to stockouts. Averaging the available demand samples (P1-P9: 38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85, 65) gives a mean of approximately 78. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Total pipeline inventory is 514, which covers approx 6.5 periods of average demand (514/78). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand levels seen since Period 5 to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to prevent the stockouts witnessed in Periods 8 and 9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-112.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 118 units on hand and 390 in transit. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed across five observations: orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6). The order placed in Period 5 was for 0 units. The next expected arrival is from Period 7 (189 units), which should arrive in Period 11 (after this decision phase). Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent periods ranging from 152 down to 6. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning the backend aims for the base stock to equal the expected demand over the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since demand is erratic and we have a zero-sold period in P9 due to stockout, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand mean while the lead time remains stable at its promised 'default' of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-77.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Using historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11), the actual lead time L is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-11) shows values: 38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85, 65, 6, 115. The mean demand is approximately 75 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 192 and there is an in-transit pipeline of 201 (from Period 8 order of 24 and Period 9 order of 177). The Period 8 order (24 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 12 (4 periods after P8), and the Period 9 order (177 units) in Period 13. My OR parameters aim to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the demand variability (std dev ~47), setting mu_hat using recent_N=11 captures the current average demand context, while sigma_hat using recent_N=11 ensures the backend accounts for the observed volatility. With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio q = 0.5, leading the OR engine to target the median demand over the lead time plus review period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, and P12). The demand history shows moderate volatility but lacks a clear seasonal trend or sustained regime shift based on the provided generic dates (Period_1 to Period_12). Average demand across all 12 periods is approximately 76.5 units. The inventory position is currently 299 units (122 on-hand + 177 in-transit from P9). Given the Lead Time (L) is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the full history mean (76.5 * 5 = 382.5), our current 299 units might be slightly low if demand spikes, but the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) results in a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning we should target the median demand (z=0). My parameters use 'calculate' for L to leverage observed stability, and 'recent_N' with N=12 (all available data) for mu and sigma to capture the overall distribution of 'Regular Chips' demand. This balances the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand shows high variability but remains within a consistent range (avg approx 94 over the last 5 periods P9-P13). The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P6, P7, P8, P9 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). In-transit inventory includes the order from P13 (84 units). We currently have 127 units on hand. Demand for Period 13 was 172, significantly higher than the previous few periods, suggesting we should maintain a robust base stock to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio. I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher activity level and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in periods 11 and 13. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods matches observed actuals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the history (confirming the Carry-over Insight). Lead time L is set to 'default'. For demand, the recent history (P5-P14) shows a mean demand of 93.5 units per period. The most recent three periods (P12-P14) show a slight increase (avg 126), but the variance is significant. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand regime which started after the initial noisy periods. This covers the (L+1) = 5 period window required by the OR backend. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated to cover the lead time plus the review period (5 periods total). On-hand inventory is low (13), and there are 276 units in transit, which align with the orders placed in P13 (84) and P14 (192). No shipments appear to be lost at this stage.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout occurring in Period 15 (sold 13 out of 82 demand). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (P1-P9 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are no arrivals pending for Period 16 (P10-P12 orders were 0), meaning the next stock arrival will be in Period 17 (from P13 order). Current demand shows moderate fluctuation (mean of 91, std dev ~49). To recover from the stockout and cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I am using a recent_N window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand patterns since Period 6, while maintaining the L parameter at the promised 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time L=4 is consistent with historical observations (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and P9 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). However, the orders from P10-P12 were for 0 units. We now face a stockout because the next expected arrival (P13 order of 84 units) is not due until P17's arrival resolution (visible in P18). Current on-hand is 0. Demand has fluctuated between 6 and 172 units. Recent demand (P12-P16) averages 108.4 units per period. Since L=4, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat centers the forecast on current trends (~542 units). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that tries to clear the backlog and meet upcoming demand, while factoring in the 455 units already in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15).

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by multiple arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, and P13->P17). However, no orders were placed in Periods 10, 11, and 12, which explains the zero arrivals in Periods 14, 15, and 16. The demand remains relatively stable with recent samples (P13-P17) of 172, 114, 82, 80, 76. The arithmetic mean of all demand samples (including pre-period data) is roughly 96. With L=4, the coverage period (L+1) is 5. mu_hat is set to 5 * 96 = 480. sigma_hat is set to sqrt(5) * std_dev. Given the current on-hand (8) + in-transit (458) = 466, and our target base stock is near 480 plus safety stock, the system will place a small necessary order. Using recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the stabilization after early noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in recent arrivals (P13 and P14 arrived exactly 4 periods later in P17 and P18). Current on-hand inventory is 52 units, and pipeline inventory is 266 units (ordered in P15 and P17). Historical demand from P1 to P18 shows a mean of approximately 88.5 units per period. The standard deviation across all samples is roughly 47 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level is q = 0.5, meaning we aim to keep base stock near the median (mean) demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the history confirms L=4. For demand (mu_hat), utilizing a larger sample size (N=18) captures the variety in demand (from 0 to 172) effectively for the (1+L) = 5 period horizon. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the default standard deviation calculation across all available historical periods to ensure adequate safety stock for this 50/50 critical ratio.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 190 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 211 units, totaling 401 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the lead time is L=4, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Historical demand samples from Period 1 to 19 show a mean of approximately 88 units per period (Avg(38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126, 51, 85, 65, 6, 115, 94, 172, 114, 82, 80, 76, 148, 41)). For 5 periods, this is 440 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 401 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time as it has been stable at 4. For mu_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand trends, which slightly exceeds the overall average. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to manage local volatility.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (e.g., P13 arrived P17, P14 arrived P18, P15 arrived P19). The next expected arrival is from the order placed in P17, which should arrive during P21. Current on-hand inventory is 58. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown recent variability but no clear sustained regime shift (Mean of the last 15 periods is ~94, while the total history mean is ~88). Given the high holding cost relative to profit (1:1), the OR backend's service level target will be 50% (q = 1 / (1 + 1)). To prevent stockouts during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the last 15 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the recent average demand of ~94 units per period better than the full history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows significant variability. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand was 76, 148, 41, 132, 53, with an average of approximately 90 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by recent arrivals (P17 order arrived at P21). Currently, there are 92 units on-hand and 318 units in-transit (orders from P18, P19, P20, P21). One order (P18) is expected to arrive during the next resolution phase. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 0.5), which mathematically simplifies the base stock to mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). However, to buffer against the observed high volatility and prevent stockouts during demand spikes (as seen in P8 and P15-P16), a slightly broader window for the mean and standard deviation is preferred. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture a more stable mean (approx 84) and volatility estimate across the last two weeks of data.

However, Period 22's conclude shows 0 arrivals (orders from P18 and P16 were 0), which explains the stockout. Demand across the last 20 periods shows moderate volatility (mean ~93, std ~44). Demand in P22 (123) and P21 (53) shows standard fluctuations. I will use 'recent_20' for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and 'default' lead time (4) to maintain safety stock while minimizing holding costs, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (critical ratio = 0.5).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility without a clear seasonal or structural trend. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P14-P23), the mean demand is approximately 92.1 units per period. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods as previously identified (confirmed again by P19's delivery in P23). My strategy is to use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to capture the current demand regime. With L=4, the backend will calculate the base stock to cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. Currently, the pipeline (In-transit: 326) and on-hand (52) total 378 units, which covers about 4.1 periods of current average demand; the OR engine will determine the precise order to maintain the target service level given the equal holding and profit costs (suggesting a 50% target service level but tempered by the cap logic).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 25. Looking at the history, the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P17->P21, P19->P23, P20->P24). On-hand inventory is 43 units, with 346 units in transit. The demand over the last 10 periods (P15-P24) averaged 85.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. Since the backend treats mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand, and L=4, we need (1+4) * 85.3 = 426.5. For volatility, sqrt(5) * 32 is approximately 71.5. I am choosing 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand regime which is relatively stable compared to the early periods. L is set to 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around the long-term mean. The last 10 periods (P16-P25) have an average demand of 89.1 units per period, which is very close to the overall average of 87.4 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 84 and in-transit units at 266, the total pipeline is 350. Given L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). A 5-period demand estimate at 89 units/period is 445. The OR backend will calculate the necessary order based on (1+L) * mean. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and level more accurately than the full history, while maintaining L at the stabilized 'calculate' setting which aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is 89.1 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with the actual observed lead times (P21, P22, P23 arrivals all confirmed a 4-period lead time). Currently, we have 38 units on-hand and 274 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26). With a lead time L=4, the base stock should cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 10-period average, the expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 445 units. The pipeline inventory (38 on-hand + 274 in-transit = 312) is below this requirement. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this recent demand regime while maintaining a responsive service level given the equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5, implying a target service level base stock at the mean).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable, with a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units over the last 10 periods (P18-P27). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P19->P23, P20->P24, P21->P25, P22->P26, P23->P27). On-hand inventory is currently low (10 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 384 units (from orders in P24, P25, P26, and P27). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most representative recent demand mean and volatility, and keep lead time at its established value of 4 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite an arrival of 83 units in Period 28, because the demand of 94 units exceeded the available supply (sold 93). This indicates a stockout. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the profit per unit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0/unit/period), the target service level is q = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0) = 0.50, which implies the base stock should target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. Looking at the recent demand (Periods 21-28), the mean is approximately 92.5 units per period. The in-transit inventory is 376 units, which roughly covers 4 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean, ensuring the system calculates a base stock approximately covering 5 periods of demand (L+1=5) to replenishment.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized with a mean around 90 units per period over the last 10 periods. Analysis of the game history confirms a reliable lead time of 4 periods, as consistently seen in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., P21 orders arrived P25, P22 arrived P26, etc.). At Period 30, the on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 29. However, there are 393 units in-transit (ordered in P26: 94, P27: 156, P28: 75, P29: 68), which cover roughly 4.3 periods of average demand. To maintain service levels while accounting for the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am using a recent window (N=10) to reflect current demand trends and keeping the lead time at the confirmed value of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering L+1=5 periods) remains responsive to the immediate demand environment.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 365 units in-transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the start of the game, demand has been relatively stable with some fluctuations around a mean of approximately 88 units per period (excluding the initial few periods). In the last 10 periods (P21-P30), demand has averaged 94.1 units. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture current demand levels. The Promised Lead Time (L) remains 4 periods, which is consistent with the 'conclude' messages. My parameters will target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent lead time has been consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P27-P31). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a relatively stable mean with some volatility. Calculating the mean demand over the last 15 periods (P17-P31) gives approximately 89.2 units per period. Since the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. On-hand inventory is 72, and in-transit is 295, totaling 367 units, which is roughly 4.1 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this recent demand regime while maintaining a stable buffer against stockouts, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of 50% (base stock near the mean).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable around a mean of 87 units over the last 15 periods (from Period 18 to 32), despite some volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as evidenced by arrivals from Period 23 through Period 32 (all showing a lead_time of 4 periods). Currently, there are 46 units on hand and 314 units in transit (ordered in Periods 29, 30, 31, and 32). To maintain a healthy service level given the equal cost of profit and holding ($1.00), I will use the recent 15 periods to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring we account for the 5-period window (L+1) required to cover demand until the next possible arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly. Over the last 15 periods (P19-P33), the mean demand is approximately 91.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., P29 order arrived in P33 conclusion). We currently have 17 units on-hand and 355 units in-transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, P33). The goal is to set parameters that cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a 15-period lookback (N=15) captures the current stable regime while providing a robust estimate for the mean and variance. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during the 4-period lead time against the dollar-for-dollar holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1), which targets a 50th percentile service level.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent mean around 85-90 units over the last 15 periods, with a slight uptick in recent volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the carry-over insight and recent arrivals for P29 and P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 34 demand slightly exceeded supply. I have 369 units in-transit (orders from P31: 86, P32: 94, P33: 109, P34: 80). Using the (L+1) logic for a 4-period lead time, we must cover 5 periods of demand. With a mean of ~90, the total pipeline requirement is ~450 units. My current pipeline (0 on-hand + 369 in-transit) = 369. The OR engine will order approximately the difference (base_stock - 369). I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out early game noise/unfilled orders.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable, though the last few periods show a slight uptick (e.g., P35 demand was 135). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by historical arrival data (P31 order arriving in P35). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=10 to capture the most recent local demand trend while maintaining stability. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 382 units. These parameters (L=4, mu_hat over 5 periods, and sigma_hat) will guide the OR backend to maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period, balancing the 50/50 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile of 0.5).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with a mean around 95 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by the arrivals from Periods 27 through 32 arriving in Periods 31 through 36). Current on-hand inventory is low (14 units), but there is a significant pipeline (404 units), which accounts for the orders from Periods 33, 34, 35, and 36 arriving sequentially. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level. I will use a recent_N of 15 to capture the stable demand regime while filtering out the more volatile early history. This will set mu_hat roughly around (1+4)*95 = 475 units to cover the pipeline and current period. No significant new patterns or shipment losses are detected.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 39 units. The pipeline (in-transit) is 355 units, consisting of orders from Periods 34 (80 units), 35 (99 units), 36 (116 units), and 37 (60 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 37 of the order from Period 33. Current demand has stabilized after some volatility; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 96.9 units. Therefore, I will use recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand level while accounting for the standard deviation of recent fluctuations. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 64 units with 358 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 30, demand has shown a slight upward shift compared to the overall history, with a mean of approximately 88.4 units over the last 9 periods (P30-P38). The inventory levels have fluctuated near zero, indicating that the base stock level needs constant adjustment to prevent stockouts while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0/unit, which equals the $1.0 profit, implying a 50% target service level). I will use recent_N (N=9) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand regime and account for the 4-period lead time plus the 1-period review cycle (1+L=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 40. Analysis of the game history confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (arrived units in P39 were ordered in P35, P38 from P34, etc.). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some fluctuations but remains relatively stable around a mean. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), demand values were [115, 84, 101, 97, 88, 135, 80, 84, 55, 118], averaging 95.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 45 units, and in-transit inventory is 304 units (from orders in P36, P37, P38, and P39). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 allows the OR backend to capture the current demand regime effectively. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to utilize the observed 4-period consistency.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 31 to 40 shows a mean of approximately 98 units per period, which is higher than the overall history average but reflects the current market behavior. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple historical observations. To manage inventory efficiently while maintaining a high service level (given the equal cost of profit vs. holding), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' window of 10 periods (covering N=10 samples from P31-P40). This captures the current demand regime and volatility accurately. The base stock level will cover the lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 23, with 318 in transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40), which aligns with the lead-time expectations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable without strong evidence of a recent regime shift. The mean demand over the last 15 periods (roughly P27 to P41) is approximately 95 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low (21 units), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 399 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P37 order arrived at P41). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median. I will use a recent_N of 15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand environment while filtering out older, less relevant data. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1) using current demand statistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but exhibits noticeable variance. The lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed, as seen from the recent arrivals of orders from Periods 37 and 38 in Periods 41 and 42. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 42 where demand (107) slightly exceeded available stock (104). The 'In-transit' total of 363 units correctly accounts for orders placed in Periods 39 (45), 40 (130), 41 (141), and 42 (47). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current demand mean and volatility, which better reflects the recent fluctuations compared to the long-term average. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the engine to utilize the consistent 4-period lead time observed throughout the history.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 43 where demand (144) significantly exceeded available supply (45). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the game history (e.g., P39 order arrived in P43). In-transit inventory is 437 units, comprising orders from Periods 40 (130), 41 (141), 42 (47), and 43 (119). Expected arrivals for the next few periods (based on L=4) are: P44: 130 units, P45: 141 units, P46: 47 units, P47: 119 units. Demand has shown some volatility but remains centered around the historical mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior (Mean approx 98, Std approx 29) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat for the (L+1) horizon. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level relative to the existing pipeline of 437 units and the current stockout state.

The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. Current on-hand inventory is low (36), with a significant pipeline (376). Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat properly captures the current demand mean while recent_N=10 for sigma_hat captures the observed volatility to maintain appropriate service levels. The 'calculate' method for lead time will use the stable historical performance of 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 46 out of 50. Demand has shown a slight upward trend or at least higher volatility in the most recent 10-15 periods (averaging around 100-110 units, compared to the initial lower samples). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P38 arrived P42, P39 arrived P43, P40 arrived P44, P41 arrived P45). With on-hand inventory at 36 and 332 units in-transit, the pipeline is relatively full. To account for the recent demand levels (the last 10 periods averaged 107.3 units), I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the recent regime while maintaining stability. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the current spread of demand. L will be kept at 'default' (promised 4) as it has been stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but exhibits noticeable volatility. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the average demand is approximately 111.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 0, while pipeline inventory is 427 units. Promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The goal for Period 47 is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). An average demand of ~111 over 5 periods suggests a target inventory level of roughly 555 units. Given the pipeline inventory of 427, the OR backend should order to fill the gap. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and its variance accurately while keeping the lead time method at calculate.

Daily Profit: $58.00, Daily Holding Cost: $61.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 48 out of 50. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. Demand over the last 10 periods (P38-P47) has averaged 108.7 units per period with a standard deviation of 31.6. In-transit inventory is 415 units (ordered P44-P47), and on-hand is 61 units. Given that we only have 3 periods of decisions left (P48, P49, P50) and a 4-period lead time, any order placed now (P48) will arrive in P52, which is after the game ends. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current pipeline against the target base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime. Setting L to 'default' (4) ensures the backend calculates the required stock for the (L+1)=5 period window. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the backend will target the median demand. A safety stock will be maintained to avoid the stockouts seen in P42, P43, and P46.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 49 out of 50, meaning this is the penultimate ordering period. The goal is to maximize total reward, which includes minimizing holding costs for the final period while meeting demand. On-hand inventory is 55. We look at the pipeline: orders from P45 (97 units), P46 (142 units), P47 (107 units), and P48 (45 units) are in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, P45 will arrive in P49, P46 in P50. Total inventory available to meet demand in P49 and P50 includes current on-hand (55) + P45 arrival (97) + P46 arrival (142) = 294 units. Historical mean demand is approximately 91 units/period. Over the final two periods (P49 and P50), expected demand is ~182 units. Our 294 units is already significantly higher than any likely demand for the remaining periods (max observed demand ~172). Consequently, ordering more would only increase holding costs without increasing revenue. I will set the parameters to ensure the OR backend places a zero order by using the default lead time and a recent demand window that captures current trends, while the large pipeline inventory ensures the 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' calculation results in zero.

Daily Profit: $63.00, Daily Holding Cost: $89.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 50. Analysis of the game history confirms that the lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods since the P8 discovery (e.g., P45 order arrived at P49). Demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable but volatile, with recent demand periods showing 62, 107, 144, 94, 141, 125, 58, 75, and 63 units. The last 10 periods (P40-P49) have an average demand of approximately 100.7 units. The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) imply a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning the base stock policy will aim near the mean demand. With an on-hand inventory of 89 and in-transit inventory of 379 (scheduled arrivals from P46, P47, P48, and P49 orders), the pipeline is well-stocked for the 4-period lead time. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand and sigma to capture the current volatility while ignoring the early game startup noise, and set lead time to the confirmed 4 periods.
