Demand Analysis: Historical samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) suggest a mean of approximately 93 units/period. Period 1's actual demand was very low (3 units), but it is too early to assume a regime shift. \n3. Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods.

Demand analysis: Historical samples show a mean demand of roughly 93 units (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). However, recent 'conclude' messages show very low actual demand in the vending machine (P1: 3, P2: 17). This indicates a significant mismatch between the historical profile and current machine performance, or a very slow start. 4. Strategy: The OR algorithm recommends 126 units based on broader historical data. Given the current pipeline of 317 units and the very low actual demand observed in the first two periods, I should be cautious. However, since the lead time is long (4 periods), I must maintain a pipeline to cover potential demand spikes and the (L+1) period window.

There is a clearly increasing trend in demand. Total In-transit is 443 (156 from P1, 161 from P2, 126 from P3). 3. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends only 1 unit.

Strategy: Following the OR recommendation of 1 unit is prudent for now. We have a significant amount of stock (443 units) currently in the pipeline which will start arriving from Period 5.

Total inventory available to satisfy demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is 103 + 480 = 583 units.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent mean demand has stabilized around 110-130 units. Using the higher estimate of 130 per period, total required for 5 periods is 650 units. Currently, we have 583 units in the system. There is a projected shortfall of approximately 67 units.\n\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR algorithm recommends 0, likely because it sees a massive pipeline relative to historical averages. However, with demand currently trending higher, a stockout risk exists in the final periods (P49-P50). I will place an order for 100 units to cover this shortfall and provide a small safety buffer for the final stretch of the game. This order is placed in P46 and will arrive in P50.",

This provides a total available inventory of 265 units for the current period. Historical demand has fluctuated significantly, with recent values ranging from 38 to 143. The OR recommendation of 162 units is based on a base-stock policy that assumes the game continues for several more periods (covering Lead Time + 1).
