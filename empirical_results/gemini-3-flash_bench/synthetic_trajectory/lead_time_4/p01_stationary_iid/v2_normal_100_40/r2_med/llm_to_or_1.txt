Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no historical lead time observations yet, I will use the 'default' lead time method. Initial demand history (Periods 1-5) shows values: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99. The mean is 93.0 and standard deviation is 38.3. Given the (L+1) exposure window of 5 periods, the expected demand (mu_hat) would be 5 * 93.0 = 465, and sigma_hat would be sqrt(5) * 38.3 \u2248 85.6. Since we start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, and the backend policy uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, providing these captures the initial demand profile. I will use 'default' for all parameters to establish the baseline using all 5 available historical samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 156 units was placed, which is currently in-transit. Since the lead time is 4, we don't expect this to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and because demand occurs after the arrival resolution phase, we will continue to have stockouts until the first order arrives. The historical demand samples provided are [143, 103, 39, 81, 99]. The mean of these 5 samples is 93. Looking at the Period 1 conclude message, the actual demand was very low (3 units), but we must base our parameters on the broader demand history provided. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and use the 5 historical samples to inform mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=5 captures the general demand level before the game started while acknowledging the stochastic nature of the samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are in the early stages of establishing inventory. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history shows orders placed in Period 1 (156 units) and Period 2 (136 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 292 units. As per the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive at the end of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing zero sales due to zero on-hand inventory, which is expected given the lead time. Demand history shows 143, 103, 39, 81, and 99 (historical) followed by 3 and 17 in the first two active periods. The drop in demand in P1 and P2 likely reflects the startup phase or a shift from historical samples. Given we have a total of 7 samples (5 history + 2 active), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while waiting for the lead time to elapse.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 317 units (ordered in Periods 1, 2, and 3). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the order from Period 1 was placed 3 periods ago and hasn't arrived yet (which is expected as per the lead time instructions where arrivals are visible in the conclude message of P1+L+1), we have no empirical lead time data to deviate from the promise. Demand history for the first five data points shows 143, 103, 39, 81, 99 (mean ~93). However, actual sales are 0 because stock has not arrived. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The OR backend will calculate base stock using L=4 and our provided mu_hat/sigma_hat estimates. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture all available historical pulses while we wait for the first shipment to arrive and satisfy the backlog.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (156 units), Period 2 (136 units), Period 3 (25 units), and Period 4 (46 units), totaling 363 units in-transit. Based on the 'Promised lead time = 4' definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive DURING Period 5 (Arrival Resolution phase) and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in Periods 1-4 is consistent with a lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced lost sales due to no stock. The demand history (143, 103, 39, 81, 99 - note: user provided samples differ slightly from 'conclude' demand but I will use the 5 provided samples) shows a mean of 93. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and set parameters to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Since we have no reason to doubt the lead time yet, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the initial behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $414.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived at the start of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand across the five observed periods has been 3, 17, 81, 95, and 114 respectively. There is a clear upward trend in demand as the game progresses (likely a ramp-up phase or seasonal growth), moving from an average of ~10 in the first two periods to ~100 in the last three. Since the lead time is 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent higher demand level (~96.6 per period), resulting in a forecast of ~483 for the 5-period window. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand regime. On-hand inventory is 42, and we have 225 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some volatility but appears to be stabilizing. Historical demand samples: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99 (from initial data) and recent observed demands from concluded periods: P1=3, P2=17 (likely stockout artifacts as starting inventory was 0), P3=81, P4=95, P5=114, P6=76. Excluding P1 and P2 due to stockout-limited visibility, the last 4 periods (P3-P6) show a mean of ~91.5. However, considering the initial samples provided (143, 103, 39, 81, 99), the overall average is around 93. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent actual demand pull (P6, P5, P4, P3, and P5-initial-sample) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time L is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 50 units and 325 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (all orders arriving exactly 4 periods after being placed). I will continue using L=4. Demand history shows mean demand of approx 73.8 units/period across the first 7 periods. However, looking at the last 3 periods (P5-P7), demand has stabilized somewhat (114, 76, 77), averaging 89. This suggests a slight regimen change from the very low early periods (P1-P2 demand was likely suppressed/unreliable due to zero inventory). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the more relevant recent demand volume while smoothing the volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to align with this demand window. Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand across 5 periods (current period + lead time). Total pipeline (50 on hand + 325 in transit = 375) is currently healthy relative to expected demand (5 * 89 = 445), but maintaining a consistent base stock via OR backend is necessary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Historical demand for the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 71.375 units per period. However, recent demand (P5-P8) shows a higher mean of 93.75 compared to the early periods. In Period 8, we ran out of stock (ending on-hand: 0) because demand (108) exceeded starting inventory (96). There are 378 units currently in transit (from orders in P5, P6, P7, and P8), with the next shipment (ordered P5, 18 units) expected to arrive during P9. Given the recent stockout and the slightly higher demand trend, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher mean and variance from the last 4 periods to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current decision period (1+L = 5 periods).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (Periods 5-9) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 8, we have experienced stockouts (demand 108 vs supply 96 in P8; demand 88 vs supply 18 in P9) because early orders (Periods 3-5) were too small to cover the realized demand regime. Demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~90 units/period (mean of all 9 periods is ~73.2, but the last 5 periods average ~92.6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 487 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Using L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the higher recent demand more accurately than the full history, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. I will use the default lead time method since it aligns with the confirmed 4-period observations.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Reviewing the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10 concludes). Demand has shown significant variability but remains somewhat stable around a mean. Specifically, demand in the last 10 periods (P1-P10) was 3, 17, 81, 95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88, 125. The initial very low demand in P1-P2 (3, 17) seems like a setup phase. Excluding those, the last 8 periods (P3-P10) average 95.5 units per period. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 373. The pipeline consists of orders from P7 (137), P8 (99), P9 (127), and P10 (10). The P7 order (137) is expected to arrive during Period 11 (this period). Given L=4, the backend needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=8 for demand to focus on the stabilized demand regime (P3-P10) and calculate for lead time as it is stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) over the last 11 periods averages approximately 89.8 units per period. The reported promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 5 through 11) confirms an actual lead time (L) of consistently 4 periods. Therefore, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Current in-transit inventory is 362 units (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11), and on-hand is 30 units, totaling 392 units. To set mu_hat, I am using the mean of the last 7 periods (from P5 to P11) which better reflects the stabilized demand compared to the early periods; the average demand in this range is roughly 99.4. Choosing recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat should capture this period of active sales more accurately than the full history, which includes early periods where 'sold' units were zero due to lack of stock. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+4) * mean(last 7) + z * sqrt(1+4) * std(last 7).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13. Analysis of historical data (Period 1 to Period 12) confirms a stable lead time of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 12 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 89.6 units per period and a standard deviation of about 33.7. Specifically, recent demand (last 5 periods) shows an average of 101.8. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 47, and in-transit inventory is 394 (representing orders from periods 9, 10, 11, and 12). Total pipeline + on-hand is 441. Our target base stock for a 5-period window (using the recent average 101.8 * 5) is approximately 509 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the full observed demand history since it remains stable, and 'calculate' for L as it consistently aligns with the observed 4-period arrival window.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on history (P1-P9 orders all arrived exactly with L=4). Period 13 concluded with an ending inventory of 74. Demand over the last 13 periods has averaged approximately 82.5 units per period (sum of demands 1-13 = 1073). Recent demand (last 5 periods: 125, 107, 82, 100, and P14 user-provided 99) shows a mean around 102.6. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is high (q=0.8). I will use a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=9 to capture the stabilized demand regime after the initial periods, while keeping L at the promised default of 4 since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time perfectly.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with 418 units in-transit. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 10 periods (P5-P14) averaging approximately 100.5 units per period. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, Period 14 ended with a stockout due to a small arrival (10 units from Period 10's order). To recover service levels and prevent further lost sales, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods of demand data (N=10) to capture the current mean of ~100. Given the lead time L=4, the OR backend will calculate base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. This should help rebuild inventory while accounting for the recent demand volatility (standard deviation remains significant).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 11 delivered orders (P1 through P11). I will continue using the promised lead time (L=4). Demand analysis over the first 15 periods shows an average of 95.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. Recently (P10-P15), demand has seen a slight uptick, averaging 110.8 units. To ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1=5) lead time window, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this recent higher demand trend, providing a base stock level that targets a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. On-hand inventory is currently low (6 units) after satisfying 120 units of demand in P15, but there is significant in-transit inventory (413 units) scheduled to arrive over the next 4 periods (P16-P19). The OR backend's capped policy will prevent over-ordering despite the recent stockouts.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival from Period 5 through Period 16. Total in-transit inventory is 422 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, P16), which is appropriate for a 4-period lead time. Demand remains stable without evidence of seasonal shifts or regime changes. Recent demand (P9-P16) shows a mean of approximately 106 units per period, while the overall mean (P1-P16) is approximately 96 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the slightly higher recent demand average and ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the current trend while maintaining sufficient safety stock.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with a slight upward trend, though Period 17 saw a lower demand value of 61. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the average demand is approximately 101.3 units per period. The confirmed lead time L remains 4 periods as established in the carry-over insights and supported by every arrival since Period 5. To cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods of demand), and accounting for the current on-hand inventory (10) and pipeline (480), I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for these 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=10 for both demand and volatility (sigma_hat) captures the recent behavior while smoothing out the minor fluctuations seen in the last few periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 60 and in-transit inventory is 412. Analysis of the order history and 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time L is consistently 4 periods (as promised), with orders from P1 through P14 all arriving exactly 4 periods later. Demand over the last 18 periods (excluding the truncated demand from P1-P4 which was limited by zero inventory) shows a mean demand of approximately 98.4 units per period. Recently, from P14-P18, demand has fluctuated (128, 120, 100, 61, 77), averaging 97.2. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). With demand stable around 98 units, the expected total demand over the lead time is approx 490 units. Current total inventory (on-hand 60 + in-transit 412 = 472) is slightly below this, but close. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 for demand to capture a stable long-term mean while filtering out the initial edge cases where inventory was zero, and 'default' for L since it matches the observations perfectly.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 20. Historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all concluded arrivals (P1-P15 orders). For chips(Regular), the demand over the last 19 periods shows a mean of approximately 86.8 units per period. Evaluating the last 10 periods (P10-19), the mean demand is 100.4 units, indicating a slight increase compared to the very early periods. The current on-hand inventory is 87 units, and in-transit is 316 units (consisting of orders from P16: 140, P17: 92, P18: 59, and P19: 25). These 316 units are expected to arrive in Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23 respectively. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the more recent demand level while maintaining the L=4 setting. This balances the service level for the slightly higher recent demand against the holding cost of the current in-transit pipeline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 11-20) shows a higher mean (~101.6) compared to the initial samples provided (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). Period 20 demand spiked significantly to 147. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (observed consistently in conclude messages). On-hand inventory is 80, and in-transit is 311 (representing orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). To ensure we cover demand across the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the recent 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the most relevant current demand regime and the recent volatility. This will result in a more responsive base stock level compared to using the entire history which includes very low demand early on.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 102 units/period over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), showing higher consistency than the initial 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 102 units per period over the last 11 periods (P11-P21). Current observation for P21 showed a lower demand (46), but this variability is consistent with the historic standard deviation which is approximately 28. The lead time is verified as consistently 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 126 units and in-transit is 363 units (ordered in P18, P19, P20, P21). Using the base stock logic for a (L+1) horizon (5 periods), the target stock should be roughly 102 * 5 = 510 plus a safety buffer. Setting L to 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (capturing the stable regime since P11) ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant mean. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=11 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 92 units. There are 354 units in transit from orders placed in Periods 19 through 22. Historical data confirms a stable lead time (L) of 4 periods. The demand for the last 12 periods (P11-P22) has averaged approximately 104 units per period, showing a stabilized regime after initial fluctuations. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this stable mean. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect recent volatility. Given the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations, I am using the default lead time setting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0 after stockout in Period 23 (demand 169 vs 117 available). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. While my previous insight at Period 21 noted an average demand of ~102, recent periods show higher volatility and a spike (Period 23 demand: 169). Using recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances the older stable regime with this recent surge, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the mean and the increased standard deviation (sqrt(1+L)*std). This helps recover from the stockout and maintain the desired service level (~80% given $4 profit vs $1 holding cost). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 23 (169 units) following a low in Period 21 (46 units), moving away from the previously stabilized regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown increased volatility recently, with a spike to 169 units in Period 23 and 110 units in Period 24. While the average from Periods 11-20 was around 102, the last four periods (P21-P24: 46, 93, 169, 110) average approximately 104.5, but with significantly higher variance. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (incorporating the 5 most recent data points including the initial seeds) to capture this recent shift in volatility. This will ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock level to maintain the service level (q = 0.8) while accounting for the current demand fluctuations and the fixed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a shift in volatility and mean. After a steady period (P11-P20, avg ~102), demand fluctuated wildly from 46 (P21) to 169 (P23). The last two periods have settled at 110 and 100. Calculating the mean for the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) yields (46+93+169+110+100)/5 = 103.6, which is very close to the long-term average. Lead time is stably confirmed at 4 periods by every concluding shipment since Period 5. To account for the recent spike in Period 23 and ensure we have sufficient coverage over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I will use a recent_N window of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased volatility while maintaining an accurate mean forecast. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering ~518 units (5 * 103.6) plus a safety buffer based on the recent standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility shift confirmed: Period 21-25 mean is 103.6, but includes a significant spike to 169 in Period 23, requiring higher sigma_hat to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile phase following a period of stability. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), demand has averaged 101.4 units, but with significant swings (min 46, max 169). The most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) average 110.8 units. Although the average demand is relatively stable around 102-110 units, the spike to 169 in Period 23 highlights the need for a robust safety stock. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 37 units on-hand and a lead time of 4, the system must rely on the 482 units in-transit to cover the next 4 periods of demand plus the current period (L+1=5). I will use the recent 10-period mean (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current regime and a slightly larger N for sigma_hat or calculate it based on a wider window to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed volatility (Standard Deviation over P11-P26 is ~30). Using recent_N=10 for all metrics provides a balanced view of the current regime's mean and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P21 onwards) has shown increased volatility with spikes of 169 and 145 causing stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in P23 and P27). The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). While the average demand remains around 102-105, the standard deviation has risen due to these fluctuations. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 7 periods (P21-P27) to capture the current mean (approx. 106.4), which multiplied by (1+L) ensures we aim for enough stock to cover the expected lead time. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 120 (approx. 53.6 * sqrt(1+4)) based on the standard deviation of this recent period to provide a buffer against the high-demand spikes recently observed and to minimize future stockouts. The lead time L is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 27 demand (145) confirms the trend of unpredictable spikes (P23: 169) impacting stock availability despite a stable long-term mean.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state at Period 29 shows on-hand inventory of 52 units and a large pipeline of 462 units. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 21, demand has exhibited higher volatility (spikes of 169 in P23 and 145 in P27) despite a rough mean around 100-110 units. The last 10 periods (P19-P28) average approximately 110 units. To account for the recently observed demand volatility and higher mean compared to the very early periods, I will use a recent window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that can cover these sporadic spikes while maintaining the reliable 4-period lead time assumption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has recently shown high volatility with significant spikes (e.g., Period 23: 169, Period 27: 145), while the overall mean remains relatively stable around 100-110 units. Period 29 demand was 93. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the backend aims for a service level that covers demand peaks. To address the recent volatility observed since Period 23 while maintaining a representative mean, I am using recent_N=9 for mu_hat (covering Periods 21-29) and recent_N=9 for sigma_hat. This captures the current regime of moderate mean but high standard deviation to ensure the 'base_stock' calculation provides enough buffer against stockouts during the L+1 (5 period) risk window. L remains at the calculated average of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the most recent period (P21 onwards), with fluctuations ranging from 46 to 169 units. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P21-P30) is 100.7 units, which is close to the long-term historical mean. However, the standard deviation has increased due to recent spikes (P23: 169, P27: 145). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P22 arrival in P26, P23 arrival in P27, etc.). To handle the current high on-hand inventory (131) and high in-transit (412) while accounting for volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 10 for both demand and volatility to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. This balance ensures we don't over-order given the high current pipeline while maintaining safety stock for potential spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $383.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last 10 periods (P22-P31) has a mean of 108.2 units, which is slightly higher than the previous stabilization around 102. However, significant volatility remains, with recent demands of 145 (P27) and 111 (P31) interspersed with lows like 54 (P30). To maintain the target service level (Profit $4 / Holding $1 gives a 0.8 critical ratio) and account for the 4-period lead time, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current mean of ~541 (108.2 * 5) and the recent standard deviation, which has increased. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P22-P31 shows a slightly higher mean of 108.2 units/period compared to the P11-P20 average of 102, with sustained volatility (Range: 54-169).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains relatively stable with a slight upward trend in mean and sustained volatility. For Period 32, the on-hand inventory is 157 with 341 units in transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 21, the mean demand has hovered around 104-108 units, but significant spikes (e.g., P23 at 169, P27 at 145) necessitate a robust sigma_hat to maintain service levels. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering the regime since Period 22) to capture the current mean and volatility dynamics, as this period accurately reflects the recent 'noisy' stability. This approach ensures the OR backend accounts for both the average demand and the frequent deviations observed in the last 10+ periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility but has settled into a higher-variance regime since Period 22. Recent demands (P31: 111, P32: 99, P33: 71) suggest a slight softening but are still consistent with the regime mean of approximately 108 units observed in P22-P31. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33. Current on-hand inventory is 191 units, and there are 328 units in-transit. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the demand characteristics since the shift around Period 22, ensuring \u03bc_hat and \u03c3_hat reflect the increased variance observed in that window to mitigate stockout risks from potential spikes while managing the holding costs of the current 191 units on hand.

Looking at the last 14 periods (P21-P34), the mean demand is approximately 100.4, but individual periods fluctuate between 46 and 169. Recent demand in P34 was 115. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 147 and 314 units in-transit (orders from P31, P32, P33, P34), we are well-covered for the immediate future. I will use N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this volatile demand regime accurately. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the frequent demand spikes (like 145 and 169) while balancing the holding cost of $1.0 against the profit of $4.0 (targeting an ~80% service level).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains characterized by high volatility but relatively stable mean levels around 100-110 units per period. The most recent demand samples (P31-P35: 111, 99, 71, 115, 79) yield an average of 95 units, which is slightly lower than the P22-P31 average of 108.2. However, given the histories of spikes (e.g., P23 at 169, P27 at 145), I will use N=14 (P22-P35) to capture the current volatile regime. This period covers the range from P22 up to the current observation. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 will help the OR backend maintain a safety stock that buffers against the observed spikes while reflecting the recent average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $357.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but volatile. In the most recent regime (P22-P36), the average demand is approximately 101.6 units per period, which is consistent with the long-term observation of ~102-108 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival since P5. Current inventory status shows 115 on-hand and 336 in-transit, totaling 451 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A base stock calculation using a mean of ~102 results in a target around 510-540 units depending on the safety factor. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the stable mean of the last 15 periods (P22-P36), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to account for the sustained volatility observed since Period 22. This approach balances the need to cover potential spikes (like the 169 in P23 and 145 in P27) while maintaining efficient inventory levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown persistent volatility and a slight upward trend in mean. Over the last 15 periods (P22-P37), the mean demand is approximately 107.2 units, with significant spikes reaching up to 169 (P23) and 167 (P37). Current on-hand inventory is 40 units, and there are 365 units in-transit. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent. Given the recent spike of 167 in P37, I will use a recent_N window of 15 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this heightened demand and volatility regime while ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (80% theoretical, though the inventory cap and formula provide additional safety).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P22-P37 shows a mean of 107.2 units/period with recurrent high-demand spikes (P23: 169, P37: 167), confirming a sustained period of high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, demand reached 150 units, which followed another high spike of 167 in Period 37. This confirms the sustained high-volatility regime identified in previous periods. The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to these consecutive high-demand periods. In-transit inventory is 471 units, with 102 units (ordered Period 35) expected to arrive in Period 39 resolution. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 22, the demand mean has shifted slightly higher to approximately 107-108 units, with significant spikes (up to 169). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (covering P22-P38) to capture this higher mean and volatility. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=17 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent spikes and maintains an appropriate safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 37 and 38.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P22-P38 mean is 109.8 units/period (calculated from last 17 periods), with 3 instances of demand >160 units, confirming high volatility and a slight upward trend from the previous 102 mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile with a slight upward trend in mean. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P22-P39) is approximately 104 units, but this includes significant spikes (e.g., P37: 167, P38: 150) and recent dips (P39: 11). To handle this volatility (N=18 periods), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18. This window captures the increased variance and the slight shift in mean observed since Period 22. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (confirming 'calculate' or 'default' are suitable; 'calculate' is more robust to future shifts). Current In-transit (510) and On-hand (91) total 601, which is approximately 5.8 periods of the current mean demand, providing a buffer through the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P22-P39 confirms high volatility (Range 11-169) with a mean of ~104 units; N=18 is now the optimal window for local demand statistics.

Daily Profit: $704.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $704.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, demand spiked to 182, which is the highest observed value in the history, following a very low demand of 11 in Period 39. This extreme fluctuation confirms the sustained high volatility identified in the carry-over insights. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 425 units consists of orders from Periods 37 (121), 38 (163), and 39 (141). Specifically, the Period 37 order is expected to arrive during Period 41. Although the mean demand since Period 22 remains around 104-108 units, the recent spike to 182 necessitates a responsive statistical window. I will continue using N=18 for mu_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime (P23-P40) and will switch sigma_hat to recent_N=18 as well to ensure the backend accounts for this increased variance (including the new 182 peak) in the base stock calculation, balancing the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1). L remains at the stable 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility hit a new peak in Period 40 with demand=182 units, confirming the regime shift towards extreme unpredictability (Range 11-182) effectively starting from Period 23.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 40 (182 units) and Period 41 (149 units) confirms the high-volatility regime identified in previous periods. Despite a long-term mean around 104-110, the frequent spikes (P23: 169, P37: 167, P38: 150, P40: 182) have led to stockouts in P38, P40, and P41 because the pipeline was insufficient for the increased variance. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To protect against these frequent spikes and the lead time of 4 periods, I am maintaining a recent_N window of 19 (spanning the volatile period from P23 to P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the localized higher variance and mean shifts, ensuring the 'base stock' calculation accounts for the high risk of stockouts during the lead time plus review period (L+1). L remains 'default' at its confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme, with the highest spike yet in Period 40 (182 units). Over the last 19 periods (P23-P41), the mean is approximately 110.5 with high variance, confirming that N=19 is the representative window for current demand behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment remains highly volatile with a slight upward trend in mean. Following the peak demand of 182 units in Period 40, the most recent demand was 87 units (Period 42). The carry-over insights suggest that since Period 23, the market has entered a regime of extreme unpredictability (Range 11-182). Over the last 20 periods (P23-P42), the mean demand is approximately 109.35 with a high standard deviation. I am setting N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P34-P38). The current high level of 'In-transit' (476 units) relative to the 5-period demand window ((L+1)*mean ~ 547) suggests that while we are in a relatively safe position, we must maintain a high service level parameter (via sigma_hat) to protect against the frequent spikes (>160 units) observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P23-P42 (20 periods) confirmed as the relevant statistical window for current volatility, with a mean of ~109.4 and frequent spikes (160+ units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent mean shift confirmed since Period 23. Over the most recent 21-period window (P23-P43), the average demand is approximately 110 units per period, with significant spikes reaching up to 182 units (P40). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 514 units, which covers roughly 4.7 periods of average demand. Given the stockouts in P38, P40, and P41, maintenance of a high service level is necessary. I will use a recent_N window of 21 (N=21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime and its slightly elevated mean, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the frequent demand spikes while managing holding costs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the order from Period 40 (which was 0 units) resulted in 0 units arriving, which is expected. The current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). In-transit inventory is 531 units, covering orders from Periods 41, 42, 43, and 44. Since Period 23, the demand has been characterized by high volatility and periodic extreme spikes (e.g., 182 in P40, 167 in P37). The most relevant statistical window for this current regime is from Period 23 to Period 44 (N=22). The mean demand in this window is approximately 108.6 units per period. I will use N=22 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P23-P44 (22 periods) confirms a mean of ~108.6 with persistent high volatility and spikes up to 182 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is characterized by high volatility and occasional extreme spikes (e.g., 182 units in P40). The average demand from Period 23 to Period 45 (23 samples) is approximately 107 units, with a standard deviation reflective of this volatility. Over the last 5 periods, demand has averaged 91 units, but given the frequent historical spikes, using a longer window (N=23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is safer to maintain service levels near the end of the game (Period 46/50). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Note: The Period 40 order was '0', and the Period 44 order (117 units) is still in transit and will arrive in Period 48. Current on-hand inventory is 108 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent mean shift. Over the last 24 periods (since the regime change in Period 23), the mean demand is approximately 110 units, but with significant spikes leading to stockouts (e.g., Period 40 demand of 182). Period 46 demand was 113, consistent with this volatile regime. Current on-hand inventory is 149 units with 356 in-transit. An order from Period 40 (0 units) arrived 'empty' as expected, and the Period 43 order (79 units) is expected to arrive during Period 47 resolution. I will continue using recent_N with N=24 to capture this high-volatility regime and setting sigma_hat to 'default' to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed standard deviation across this window to maintain a high service level against spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P23-P46 (24 periods) shows a mean of ~110.1 units with sustained high volatility (Range: 11-182).

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile with a slight upward drift in the mean, currently estimated at approximately 110-111 units per period over the relevant window (P23-P47). Last period demand was 143, confirming continued high levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 85 with 390 units in-transit (orders from P44-P47). To maintain service levels against potential spikes (up to 182 units) while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N with N=25 (P23-P47) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime. This window accounts for the elevated variance since Period 23.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P23-P47 (25 periods) shows a mean of ~111.4 units with high volatility (Range: 11-182) and frequent spikes over 140 units.

Daily Profit: $496.00, Daily Holding Cost: $78.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 49, we are in the high-volatility regime identified since Period 23. Demand in Period 48 was 124 units, continuing the pattern of moderate to high demand. The current mean since the last regime shift (P23-P48) is approximately 111.4 units with significant variance (Range 11-182). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only two periods left (49 and 50), the OR backend needs to cover demand for the remaining horizon. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 422) plus On-hand (78) totals 500 units, which generously covers the expected demand for the remaining two periods (~223 units based on current mean). I will use N=26 (P23-P48) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this volatile regime and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the current demand environment remains characterized by the high-volatility regime that emerged around Period 23. Over the last 27 periods (P23-P49), the demand mean is approximately 110.4 units with high variance and frequent spikes above 140 units. Most recently, demand has dropped to 38 units (P49), but this aligns with the established volatility (Range 11-182). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 132, and in-transit inventory is 455 units. To maintain responsiveness to potential spikes while managing holding costs, I am using N=27 to capture the full statistical profile of this current regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat). This covers the (L+1) exposure window of 5 periods of demand. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the stable observed lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P23-P49 (27 periods) remains the relevant statistical window, with a mean of ~110.4 and sustained high volatility (Range: 11-182).
