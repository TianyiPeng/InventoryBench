Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand data for the last 5 periods shows the following: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99. The mean demand is approximately 93. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current review period (1+4=5 periods). Given the volatility in the sample (std dev approx 38), I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will calculate the forecast and safety stock requirements based on the available history of 5 samples. This approach balances the need for inventory to meet demand during the lead time while managing the holding cost. No shipments are pending yet, so reconciliation is not possible this period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 156 units, but they haven't arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we started with 0 on-hand, we couldn't satisfy the demand of 38 units in Period 1 (sold=0). The current in-transit is 156. The historical demand for this SKU over the first 5 periods (including those not yet 'concluded' in the game flow but provided in the samples) is [143, 103, 39, 81, 99]. Calculating the mean of these samples gives 93.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 38.0. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the mean of 93, mu_hat = 5 * 93 = 465. Sigma_hat for 5 periods is sqrt(5) * 38 \u2248 85. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend uses these specific total-horizon values derived from the 5-sample prior.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Observations from Period 1 and 2 show customer demand of 38 and 103 respectively. However, we have sold 0 units because the starting inventory was 0 and no shipments have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive in P5 (visible in P6), and orders from P2 in P6 (visible in P7). Currently, there are 312 units in transit (156 from P1 + 156 from P2). Since we have no recorded 'conclude' messages showing actual arrivals yet, we must rely on the promised lead time (L=4). Demand appears to be averaging around 93 units per period based on the first two samples (38, 103), though the initial dataset provided in the prompt suggests a broader context (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). Using 'default' for mu_hat will utilize all available historical samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99, plus observations from P1 and P2) to estimate the mean over (1+L) periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 461 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first three periods has been 38, 103, and 83 (average ~75). Period 4 demand is not yet concluded. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet and are within the promised lead time window, I will use the 'default' lead time (4). For demand, I will use the mean of the available historical samples (Period 1-5 data provided in prompt: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99; mean = 93) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using 'default' methods allows the backend to utilize all available historical data points.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have not yet arrived as of the Period 4 conclusion (which makes sense, since an order placed in Period 1 with a 4-period lead time is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be reflected in the Period 5 conclusion message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 560 units in transit. Demand has been fluctuating: 38 (P1), 103 (P2), 83 (P3), and a reported 0 (P4). Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, we cannot accurately calculate a modified lead time; however, the pipeline is full and we must maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent demand volatility (avg ~56). For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=4 will account for the high variance observed in these initial periods. I will keep L at the default (4) as no orders have concluded to prove a deviation yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2884.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5 (arrived=156), confirming the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods. Current demand data shows significant variability: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99 (from initial samples) and 38, 103, 83, 0, 152 (from actual play). However, Period 4 demand was reported as 0 and Period 5 as 152, suggesting a possible backlog or reporting lag since on-hand was zero for the first 4 periods. Total demand across 10 observations averages 84.1 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My target base stock is approximately 5 * 85 = 425 units. We have 4 units on-hand and 404 in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). This leaves us slightly lean. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand based on the recent average of 84 units per period across 5 periods (420 total).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 34 units on-hand and 420 units in-transit. History shows orders from P1 and P2 arrived exactly after 4 periods (promised lead time is 4). Demand data for the first 6 periods is: 38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126. The zero demand in Period 4 is likely an outlier or data recording artifact given the surrounding values. The average demand across all 6 periods is approximately 83.6. However, the more recent periods (P5-P6) show significantly higher demand (avg 139) compared to the start. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and variance to capture the recent upward trend while smoothing out the P4 outlier. L will remain default as observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $837.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Analyzing the history: Orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 have arrived exactly after a lead time of 4 periods (arriving in the resolution phase of Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively). This confirms the promised lead time of L=4 is currently stable. Demand has shown some volatility but no clear sustained regime shift yet (Avg of all periods: ~79; Avg of last 3 periods: ~76). Current on-hand inventory is 132, and in-transit inventory is 498 (orders from Periods 4, 6, and 7). Note that Period 5 had an order of 0. Since the pipeline is already quite full (498 units in-transit) and L=4, the backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using 'default' (all history) for mean and variance is appropriate here as the sample size is small (7 periods of demand) and no significant trend is yet visible.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1, P2, P3 orders arrived at P5, P6, P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1469.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The lead time is confirmed to be consistent with the promised 4 periods (as evidenced by P1-P4 orders arriving exactly at P5-P8). Current on-hand inventory is 146 units, and 399 units are in-transit (orders from P6 and P7). Demand history shows significant variability but no clear seasonal trend yet (P1: 38, P2: 103, P3: 83, P4: 0, P5: 152, P6: 126, P7: 51, P8: 85). The mean demand over these 8 periods is approximately 79.75. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend's target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95). I will use L=4 (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full recent demand profile while addressing the inherent volatility observed in the start-up phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1154.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Based on the game history, orders from Period 1 through 4 have consistently arrived with an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. Orders from Period 5 and Period 8 were 0 units, which explains 'arrived=0' in the conclude messages for Period 9. The 'In-transit' quantity of 434 matches the sum of orders from P6 (172), P7 (227), and P9 (35), confirming no shipments are currently lost. Demand has been relatively stable with some variance (range 0-152). I will use L=4 (promised and confirmed) and set demand parameters based on recent performance (N=9) to capture the average demand of ~78 units/period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring we satisfy incoming customers while accounting for the ~41% of pipeline already on its way.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-133.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 have all arrived exactly at L=4). P5 had 0 units ordered, explaining the zero arrival at P9. The current demand history shows a period of volatility with a recent drop (P10 demand was 6). Specifically, the demand for the last five periods (P6-P10) was 126, 51, 85, 65, and 6. This averages to 66.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 247, and in-transit is 308 (comprised of P7: 227, P9: 35, and P10: 46). Given L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand around 67, the required stock is approximately 335. Total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 555, which is well above the requirement. I will use recent_N=5 for demand mean and variance to capture the recent softening in demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as seen in the arrival data for orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. The current on-hand inventory is high at 359 units due to a large arrival of 227 units in Period 11, while the pipeline inventory (ordered in Periods 9 and 10) is 81 units. Demand has been fluctuating significantly, with a low of 6 in Period 10 and a high of 152 in Period 5. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the average demand of approximately 75 units per period over the last 11 periods, the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods) is likely already exceeded. I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=11 for demand parameters to capture the post-initial-stockout behavior while smoothing out the high variance (e.g., P5 vs P10).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Reviewing history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7 arriving exactly at P+4). Demand shows significant variability but no clear seasonal trend yet (P5: 152, P10: 6, P11: 115). The current on-hand inventory is 265 and in-transit is 194 (orders from P9, P10, and P12). Order P9 (35 units) is expected to arrive during P13 resolution. Total pipeline + on-hand = 459. Demand from the last 12 periods averages ~76.5 units. Using a lead-time of 4 means we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. 5 * 76.5 = 382.5. With current inventory at 459, we are well-covered, but the OR backend's capped policy will handle the exact ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full experienced demand history while excluding the initial empty on-hand phase where demand was occasionally recorded as 0 or lost due to no stock.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals in periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 13). Inventory management currently reflects an on-hand balance of 128 units with 254 units in transit (ordered in periods 10, 12, and 13). Demand has shown significant volatility, ranging from as low as 0 to as high as 172. The most recent demand (P13) was 172, while the mean of the last 13 periods is approximately 84. To protect against recent high demand spikes while accounting for the 4-period lead time (requiring coverage for 5 periods: L+1), I am using a recent window of N=8. This window captures the varied demand environment since stabilized operations began and avoids the early zero-demand noise from period 4. This selection balances the need for a safety buffer against the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2106.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward trend, with the last two periods (P13 and P14) recording demand levels of 172 and 114 respectively, significantly higher than the low of 6 in P10. Calculating the mean of the most recent 10 demand samples (P5-P14) provides a more robust estimate of the current regime than the full history, especially considering the early zero-demand periods. The mean for P5-P14 is approximately 101. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P9, P10 orders). Using L=4, the base stock (mu_hat) should cover demand for L+1=5 periods. mu_hat = 5 * 101.0 = 505. For sigma_hat, using the standard deviation from the same 10-period window provides an accurate measure of current volatility. Current inventory position: On-hand (60) + In-transit (381) = 441. With a target base stock around 500-600 (depending on the safety factor), the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16. Inventory is depleted (on-hand: 0). The demand in Period 15 was 82 units, but we only had 60 units on-hand, leading to lost sales. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 5-8, 10-11, 13-14) consistently confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Our pipeline (in-transit) is 560 units, consisting of orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15. The order from P12 is expected to arrive during the current period (P16 Resolution Phase) and become visible at the start of P17. Demand analysis: The last 10 periods (P6-P15) show a mean demand of approximately 91 units per period. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand levels for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using L=4 (total period coverage = 5) and the service level target implied by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.95), the backend will calculate a base stock to cover about 5 periods of demand (~455 units). Since 560 units are in-transit, this will likely result in a zero or small order now, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs as the backlog arrives.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods consistently. Demand in the most recent periods (P10-P16) shows a slight shift in variability and mean. Looking at the last 5 demand samples (P12-P16: 94, 172, 114, 82, 80), the average is approximately 108.4. My goal is to set parameters that cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 captures this recent trend while filtering out the very low demand outlier of Period 10. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the most recent 5 periods to reflect current volatility. On-hand inventory is low (33), and while in-transit (509) is significant, it's spread across several periods (P13, P14, P15, P16 orders). The P13 order is expected to arrive during P17.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is low (52 units) and we recently experienced a stockout in Period 15, indicating our supply buffer was insufficient for demand volatility. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders (P1-P4, P6-P7, P9-P10, P12-P13). The demand pattern appears relatively stable but exhibits significant variance; the average demand over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) is approximately 89.5 units. To ensure better coverage and recover from the low inventory position, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and volatility accurately. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by orders from periods 1 through 14. Current on-hand inventory is 77, with 381 units in-transit. Demand over the last 18 periods has shown significant variability (range 0 to 172), with a mean around 90. However, the most recent demand (P18) was 148, and there was a stockout in P15. To ensure a high service level while managing holding costs, I am calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 14 samples to capture the stabilized post-startup demand pattern. The parameters will target covering demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean with some variability (P15-P19 demand: 82, 80, 76, 148, 41). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is approximately 93.4 units, which aligns closely with the overall sample average (~91). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed since Period 5, including the most recent arrival (P15 order arrived at P19). Currently, the inventory position (on-hand 215 + in-transit 373 = 588) is being reconciled against an expected lead time of 4. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current demand distribution accurately while buffering against the volatility seen in Period 18. This approach ensures a balanced service level matching the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fluctuating but remains around a historical mean. Analyzing the recent 10 periods (P11-P20), the average demand is approximately 108 units per period, with a standard deviation around 42. Specifically, recent demand from P13 onwards: 172, 114, 82, 80, 76, 148, 41, 132 (Mean=105.6). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P9, P10, P12, P13, P14, P15, P16 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 145, and in-transit is 365 (orders from P17, P18, P19, P20). Total pipeline is 510. The system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, which provides a balance between the high demand seen in P13 and P18 and the lower demand in P19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $775.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the delivery history (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P9, P10, P12-17 all arrived exactly at L=4). Demand remains somewhat volatile but stable around a mean. Recent demand (last 10 periods, P12-P21) averages 101 units per period, while the overall average is approximately 96 units. Given the service level target (critical ratio ~0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the slightly higher recent mean, and 'default' for sigma_hat to ensure a robust safety stock using all available history. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods. Current on-hand (232) and in-transit (385) look healthy against a 5-period demand window (approx 500 units), but the OR backend will refine the order based on these targets.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate fluctuations but no clear structural shift, with the last 10 periods averaging approximately 92 units per period (Std Dev ~44). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (arriving in Period N+4, visible in Period N+5). Currently, we have 109 units on hand and 426 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy: (L+1)*demand + Safety_Stock. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 10-period average (92 * 5 = 460) as a benchmark, our pipeline (109 + 426 = 535) is currently healthy. To maintain this, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture the current demand volatility while relying on the calculate method for lead time, as it has been stable.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 6 onwards (excluding the early initialization phase) shows a mean demand of approximately 92.4 units per period. In the last 5 periods (P19-P23), the mean is slightly higher at 84.2, but with significant volatility. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as noted in Period 8 carry-over and validated by the arrival of P19's order in P23). Because the lead time is L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using N=18 (covering the data since the demand stabilized after the initial first 5 periods) provides a robust estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing recent variability with long-term average stability. Profit ($19) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a high service level (0.95), which the OR backend will target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 25. The on-hand inventory is 190, and in-transit is 345. Historical lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple recent concluding orders (P19 arrived P23, P20 arrived P24). The demand pattern remains relatively stable with no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes detected in the recent periods (P21-P24 demand: 53, 123, 72, 72). The average demand over the last 15 periods (P10-P24) is approximately 88 units per period. I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this stable regime while smoothing out the volatility observed in earlier periods. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed stability of the 4-period lead time.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 26. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (observed across multiple arrivals, including the most recent arrival at Period 25 from Period 21). Historical demand has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations but no clear regime shift; the mean demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 93 units. With an on-hand inventory of 260 and in-transit inventory of 269 (total 529), we are currently well-covered against the expected demand for the lead period + revision period (L+1 = 5 periods). A base stock level of (5 * 93) + safety stock is roughly 460-600 units. Since current pipeline inventory (529) is within this range, the OR backend will naturally modulate orders. I will use a recent_N of 15 for demand to capture recent volatility while maintaining stability.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Over the last 15 periods (P12-P26), the mean demand is approximately 93.3 units per period with a standard deviation of 37.1. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival data (confirmed by carry-over insights and recent arrivals from P19-P22). In-transit inventory stands at 320 units, covering orders from P23 to P26. On-hand inventory is 169. To maintain an optimal base stock level that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand while balancing a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 19:1, suggesting a high service level), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to capture the current demand regime. Lead time is set to 'default' as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (e.g., Period 23 order arrived at Period 27). I will maintain L at 'default'. Demand appears relatively stable without clear regime shifts or seasonal spikes in the recent history. The average demand across all historical samples (Period 1 to Period 27) is approximately 87 units per period. Using this stable mean for mu_hat (covering L+1 = 5 periods) results in 5 * 87 = 435. Current pipeline inventory (on-hand 227 + in-transit 328) is 555 units, which is already above the likely base stock requirement, suggesting a period of no ordering or capping by the OR backend. I'll use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR backend utilize the full sample history for its statistical calculations, as no significant recent trend deviates from the long-term average.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the history (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P9, P10, P12, P13, P14, P15, P16, P17, P19, P20, P21, P22, P23, and P24 orders have all arrived with a lead time of 4). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows no significant seasonal shifts or regime changes based on the available data; the demand since Period 1 has fluctuated between 0 and 172. The mean demand over the last 20 periods (P9-P28) is approximately 93.3 units per period. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the backend continue using the empirical lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a window of 20 periods (N=20) to capture recent demand stability and variability. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for roughly 467 units of demand, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 153 units with 373 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by actual arrivals from orders in P21-P25), resulting in a review+lead time window of L+1=5 periods. Recent demand (P20-P29) shows a mean of approximately 88.8 units per period (888 total over 10 periods). The previous historical data provided in the prompt (before Period 1) showed slightly different levels, but the game history reveals a relatively stable regime. Using N=10 for mu_hat correctly captures this recent mean demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock (target inventory) covers the expected 444 units of demand (88.8 * 5) plus a safety buffer while accounting for the significant inventory already in the pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 92 units over the last 15 periods (Periods 16-30), with standard deviation decreasing as well. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across almost all observed arrivals. The current on-hand inventory is 130 and in-transit is 318, totaling 448 units. Based on a 5-period window (L+1), the expected average demand is around 460 units. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this stable regime, and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations. This setup provides sufficient coverage for the lead time pipeline while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean. In the last 15 periods (since Period 16), demand has averaged 89 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 186 units and 305 units in-transit, our total pipeline (491) is well-positioned relative to the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1), which amounts to approximately 445 units (89 * 5). To maintain this balance and account for the high service level dictated by the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean and volatility calculation, focusing on the last 15 periods to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initialization volatility from the first 5-10 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with no clear seasonal or regime shifts observed in the recent history (Periods 20\u201332). The mean demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 94 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P28 order arrived at P32, lead_time 4). On-hand inventory is 126 and in-transit is 349, totaling 475 units across the pipeline. This inventory level needs to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (Total 5 periods). 5 periods * ~94 units = 470 units. My current pipeline is almost exactly at the required base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the recent volatility and mean while smoothing out single-period spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1714.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized over the last 15+ periods around a mean of ~92 units. There are no clear seasonal shifts or calendar events identified from the 'Period_N' date format. The inventory status shows On-hand (129) + In-transit (336) = 465 units, which covers roughly 5 periods of average demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (promised = actual). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend's default service level target is high (~95%). Using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=20 periods provides a stable estimate of the current regime while filtering out the high volatility seen in the very early periods (P1-P5). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=20) to capture current demand volatility accurately, which is lower than the initial startup phase. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods (approx. 90 units per period) without significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (78) plus in-transit stock (400) is 478 units. Based on an average demand of 90, the pipeline cover is approx 5.3 periods, which aligns with the (L+1) requirement for a 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand environment while filtering out earlier volatility. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 15 periods, fluctuating around a mean of approximately 95 units per period. The on-hand inventory is at 70 units, with 350 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the carry-over insight and recent arrivals from Period 27-31). My strategy is to set my base stock levels to cover a 5-period window (L+1), ensuring enough stock to meet demand during the lead time plus the current period's resolution. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=15 to capture the stable behavior observed since Period 20, filtering out earlier volatility. The OR engine will then calculate the order based on the critical ratio derived from $19 profit and $1 holding cost, which targets a high service level (~95%).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 75 units with 399 units in-transit. The demand history shows a relatively stable pattern with no significant trend or seasonal shifts detected in the last several periods (P30-P36 demand: 84, 101, 97, 88, 135, 80). The mean demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 95 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by carry-over insights and recent arrivals (P32 order arriving on P36). Using L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and volatility effectively without being overly influenced by early-game fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1518.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 97.4 units (last 10 periods), showing consistency without significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5 (including the most recent arrivals in Periods 35, 36, and 37). On-hand inventory is currently at 78 units with 395 units in-transit. Since the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual observed lead time, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most stable recent demand window (Periods 28-37) where mean is ~97 and std is ~17. This balances the risk of stockouts without incurring excessive holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 39. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 124 units, with 365 units in transit. Recent demand (last 10 periods, P29-P38) has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 92.6 units per period. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of the last 10 samples (N=10) provides a robust forecast for this regime while smoothing out minor fluctuations. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts or seasonal spikes observed in the history. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival logs. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 83 units with a significant amount (338 units) in transit, which covers approximately 3.7 periods of average demand (avg demand ~91). Since the lead time is 4, looking ahead at L+1 (5 periods), the backend needs to maintain a base stock that accounts for demand during this window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand behavior from the last 20 periods while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to rely on the historically observed average of 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but slightly elevated in the most recent periods, with an average demand of approximately 94.6 units over the last 15 periods (P26-P40). Lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods (as noted in carry-over insights and confirmed by every recent arrival). On-hand inventory is 79, and there are 339 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40), which aligns with the lead time and the order history. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the most relevant demand characteristics (mean ~95, std ~24). This period's order will arrive at the start of Period 46. With a Lead Time of 4, the target inventory (base stock) needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) has been stable with a mean of approximately 92.5 units over the last 20 periods. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 495 units. To ensure optimal service level while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the most recent demand regime (approx periods 22-41). The L parameter is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. There are no missing shipments as all orders from P1 through P37 have concluded according to the 4-period lead time logic.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 20 periods with a mean of approximately 93 units and a standard deviation around 22. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38 exactly 4 periods after they were placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 64 and there are 393 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Since lead time is stable at 4, I will use L=4 and set mu_hat based on the last 20 periods of demand to capture the recent stable regime (N=20). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same window. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2166.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 443 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 43 (144 demand vs 114 starting on-hand). The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently shows an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since P39 arrived in P43, we expect P40's order (135 units) to arrive in P44, P41's order (139 units) in P45, P42's order (69 units) in P46, and P43's order (100 units) in P47. Demand has remained relatively stable; the mean of the last 20 periods (P24-P43) is approximately 97 units. I will use a recent_N of 20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, yet slightly volatile, demand pattern and ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1745.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the long term, but recently (last 10 periods) it has shown an average of approximately 99.4 units per period, compared to the overall historical mean of roughly 90. Period 43 saw a stockout where demand was 144 but only 114 could be sold, indicating that recent demand spikes are outstripping inventory levels given the lead time. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With only 41 units on hand and 5 periods remaining in the simulation, it is critical to maintain service levels while accounting for the lead time delay. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the higher recent demand variance and volume, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the 4+1 periods of demand (L=4). Using recent_N=10 balances responsiveness to recent spikes (like Period 43) with enough stability to avoid over-ordering as the game concludes.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a slight upward trend in volatility. Period 45 demand was 141, and Period 43 demand reached 144, indicating a recent average demand of approximately 100-110 units per period. The lead time is confirmed as a stable 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P40 arriving at P44, P41 arriving at P45). With 39 units on-hand and 446 units in-transit, the pipeline is substantial. To capture the recent demand level while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time, I am setting L to 4 using the 'calculate' method and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=15 to balance recent fluctuations and the long-term mean. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=15 to reflect current volatility accurately. This targets a service level appropriate for the $19.0 profit/unit and $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend in the most recent periods, with demand reaching 141 (P45) and 125 (P46), following a period of 144 (P43). The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 111.4, which is notably higher than the long-term average. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in P43 and P46, though a large pipeline of 506 units is in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to prevent further stockouts. I am switching to 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to capture this heightened demand regime while maintaining a responsive safety stock. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent shift in both volume and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting around Period 39: average demand increased from ~85 to ~111 (+30%) over the last 8-10 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The demand regime shift noted in Period 47 remains significant; the average demand since Period 39 is approximately 110 units (Periods 39-47: 118, 138, 62, 107, 144, 94, 141, 125, 58). This is a noticeable increase from the previous long-term average of 85. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), orders placed now in Period 48 will arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is outside the game window. Consequently, the in-transit inventory of 553 units is more than sufficient to cover demand for the final 3 periods (expected ~330 units). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce orders as pipeline inventory exceeds the base stock. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the regime start at P39) to accurately reflect the higher demand volatility and mean for the remaining logic, though physical arrival of new orders is impossible before the game ends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1319.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 39. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is 106.2, compared to the earlier baseline of ~85. The inventory level has been under pressure, with zero stock events in P43 and P46, indicating that the base stock level needs to remain elevated to meet this higher demand. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out older, lower demand data. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the consistent 4-period lead time. This will ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock covering the 5-period risk window (L+1) at the new demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1016.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift starting around Period 39. The average demand in this new regime (Period 39 to Period 49) is approximately 102.3 units, compared to the earlier average of ~85 units. Recent demand has shown volatility with values like 141 (P45) and 125 (P46), but also lower values like 58 (P47) and 75 (P48). I am using recent_N with N=11 to capture the entirety of this elevated demand regime (P39-P49). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (e.g., P45 order arrived at P49). On-hand inventory is 181, with 407 in transit. Since we are at the end of the simulation (Period 50), the parameters will govern the final ordering decision to mitigate stockout risks while managing holding costs for the remaining period.
