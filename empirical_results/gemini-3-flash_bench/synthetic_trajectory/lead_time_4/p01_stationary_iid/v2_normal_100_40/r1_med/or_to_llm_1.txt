Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) show high variability with a mean of ~93. Period 1 actual demand was 38, which is on the lower end but within the historical range. 3. Strategy: The goal is to maintain a 'base stock' that covers (L+1) periods of demand (5 periods). Mean demand over 5 periods is approximately 465 units. Current pipeline (156) is significantly below this requirement. 4. Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 151 units is based on the full historical sample and a capped policy. Adding 151 to the existing 156 pipeline brings the total coverage to 307. While still lower than the 465 mean, the OR cap is designed to prevent over-ordering in high-variance scenarios.

The average is ~93. The actual demand in Periods 1-3 (38, 103, 83) is roughly consistent with this average. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 41 units is very low because it sees a massive pipeline (456) relative to expected demand. However, until the Period 1 order arrives in Period 5, we are stocking out (sold=0 in all previous periods due to 0 inventory). I will place a moderate order to maintain the pipeline. The OR's 'base stock' calculation likely assumes a steady state that hasn't started yet because nothing has arrived.

Therefore, any order placed now is useless for generating profit and will only incur potential holding costs if the game logic evaluates ending inventory.

The OR algorithm recommends 153 units based on historical demand (mean ~92 units). Current state: On-hand is 74, In-transit is 240 (from Periods 45, 46). Specifically, the Period 45 order of 164 units is expected in Period 50, and the Period 46 order of 76 units is expected in Period 51. Since any order placed now (Period 49) will only arrive in Period 53, and the game ends at Period 50, the order quantity has no impact on satisfying demand within the game limits.

However, given recent stockouts in Period 43 and 46, and the fact that 76 units are arriving immediately to satisfy Period 50 demand, I will follow the OR's recommendation of 152 to maintain a healthy safety buffer and ensure we meet demand through the 4-period lead time window.",
