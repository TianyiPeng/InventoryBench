Since we already have 425 units (122 OH + 303 IT), a large order is not required.

Demand Analysis: A significant demand regime shift was noted at Period 8, decreasing from ~100 to ~55. However, Period 8 itself saw a spike to 104, while Period 9 returned to 52. Averaging the 'new' regime (Periods 5-9) gives (48+63+54+104+52)/5 = 64.2 units/period. Period 8 appears to be an outlier. 3. Inventory Analysis: Current On-hand = 180. In-transit = 115 (P6: 35, P7: 45, P8: 0, P9: 35). Pipeline total = 295. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 122 units. This seems high because the OR uses a safety factor based on the entire history (including the high-demand Periods 1-4) and doesn't fully discount the low-demand regime shift. 5. Strategy: Using the base-stock logic for L=4: We need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Target inventory = (5 * 65) + safety stock. With a mean of 65, target is ~325 + safety. Our current pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 180 + 115 = 295. If we order 122, our pipeline becomes 417, which is too high given the ~65 demand (417/65 = 6.4 periods of stock), leading to high holding costs.

While earlier periods (P1-P4) averaged ~100, the current regime is lower. The spike to 104 in P8 and 83 in P10 suggests volatility, but the overall average has shifted down by approximately 30-40% compared to the start of the game.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 132. Pipeline (In-transit) is 140. Total inventory position = 272 units. \n4. **Strategy**: Target inventory for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a weighted demand estimate of 75 units (buffering slightly above the low-regime average due to recent spikes), we need 5 * 75 = 375 units to cover the lead time. \n5. **OR Comparison**: OR recommends 120 units.

Strategy: We are currently stocked out (Ending inventory P13 = 0).

However, the goal is to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. \n\n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 118 units. Total Pipeline + OR Recommendation = 384 + 118 = 502 units. Over 5 periods (P36-P40), at an average demand of 100, we expect to consume ~500 units.

In-transit pipeline includes P42 (102), P43 (115), P44 (65), and P45 (80), totaling 362 units. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) = 395 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P41-P45) has been 101, 113, 77, 78, 99 (avg ~93.6). The overall high-volume regime established around P16 (~100 units/period) is stable, though slightly softer in the last 5 periods.\n4. **End-of-Game Constraint**: We are at Period 46 of 50. Orders placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, this is the final order that can satisfy demand.\n5. **Strategy**: Target inventory should satisfy demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50). Total expected demand = 5 * 100 = 500. Total inventory currently committed is 395. Shortfall = 500 - 395 = 105 units. \n6. **OR Calibration**: The OR recommendation is 106 units.
