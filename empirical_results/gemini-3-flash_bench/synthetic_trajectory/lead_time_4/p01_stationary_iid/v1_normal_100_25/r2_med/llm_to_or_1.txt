Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with a promised lead time (L) of 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 100, 69, 92, 77, and 111, yielding a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of 17.15. Since we have no specific calendar dates or product category specifics beyond 'chips(Regular)', I will use the baseline statistics provided. To ensure the inventory covers the pipeline lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this initial distribution. No lead time data is available yet, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an initial order of 118 units. According to the 'Period 1 conclude' message, that order has not arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since on-hand inventory was 0, we unfortunately lost all demand (89 units) in Period 1. The in-transit pipeline is currently 118 units. Historical demand across the first 5 periods (provided in prompt) was 100, 69, 92, 77, 111 (average ~90). This matches the observed demand of 89 in Period 1. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand statistics to capture the available historical sample mean (~89.8) and standard deviation (~16.7). This will guide the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers roughly 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring we replenish appropriately once we actually have stock to sell.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 118 units, and in Period 2, we ordered 114 units, totaling 232 units in-transit. Due to the Lead Time definition, these orders are not expected to arrive until Period 5 (P1 order) and Period 6 (P2 order) respectively. Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales for the demand of 89 and 98 units. Since no arrivals have occurred yet, we cannot confirm any deviation from the promised lead time of 4. Demand samples (excluding the game history which might be noisy or represent lost sales differently) are P1: 100, P2: 69, P3: 92, P4: 77, P5: 111. Average demand across these 5 samples is approximately 89.8. I will use the default promised lead time and recent_N for demand parameters to stabilize the forecast around the observed 5-period mean (N=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit (Total in-transit: 118+114+114 = 346), which is expected given the lead time timing: an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) arrives in Period 5's arrival phase and is first visible in the Period 6 start observation. Demand for the item 'chips(Regular)' over the first three periods has been 89, 98, and 114 (Mean \u2248 100.3, Std \u2248 12.6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units due to the lead time gap. My objective is to provide parameters that cover demand for the lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the slightly increasing trend in the few observations we have, and stick with the 'default' promised lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing 0 on-hand and 0 arrivals in history (Periods 1-4) is expected. Total demand over the first 5 periods (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) averages 89.8 units per period, while the current inventory position (On-hand: 0 + In-transit: 468) covers roughly 5.2 periods of this average demand. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current pipeline inventory is roughly sufficient, but we have experienced 100% stockouts due to the initial lead time lag. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent statistics while the system stabilizes. This will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand history for the first 5 periods (samples provided: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111; actual realized demand in history: 89, 98, 114, 101, 48) shows a mean of approximately 90 units per period, though Period 5 saw a significant drop to 48. Given the limited history and the recent drop, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to weigh recent observations more heavily while keeping sigma_hat at default to account for the observed volatility. In-transit inventory (415) represents orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. With a lead time of 4, we expect the Period 2 order to arrive in Period 6's arrival phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Looking at the history, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly 4 periods later (arrived at P5 and P6 respectively), confirming the lead time L=4 is currently stable. In terms of demand, the historical samples provided (P1-P5) were [100, 69, 92, 77, 111] with an average of 89.8. However, the game history for concluded periods P1-P6 shows actual demand values of [89, 98, 114, 101, 48, 63]. There is a noticeable drop in demand starting around Period 5. The average of the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is 70.6, while the average for P1-P3 was 100.3. Because of this recent shift, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower trend and avoid over-ordering, while keeping the sigma_hat at a broader range to account for the volatility seen in the early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 181, In-transit: 191) following the arrival of early large orders. Demand analysis shows a significant downward shift: the first 4 periods averaged 100.5 units, while the last 3 periods (P5-P7) averaged only 55 units. To prevent excessive holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to capture this lower demand regime. Since L is stable at 4, I will use the default promised lead time and calculate volatility based on the recent regime (N=3) to refine the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: average decreased from ~100 to 55 (-45%). Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1, P2, P3 orders delivered in P5, P6, P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe the demand history and lead time performance. The promised lead time is 4 periods and the actual lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (Period 1-4 orders arrived in Periods 5-8). Demand shifted significantly at Period 5. Samples 1-4 averaged ~100.5, while samples 5-7 averaged 55. However, Period 8 saw a spike back to 104. Given this volatility, I will use a shorter window (N=4) to capture the recent shift and the subsequent spike. Our on-hand inventory is high (199) and in-transit is 69 (from P5-P8 orders), which should cover the (L+1) horizon of roughly 350-400 units, but the OR backend's base-stock logic will handle the actual order quantity once I provide the updated parameters. I choose recent_N=4 for both mu and sigma to reflect the post-shift environment starting at Period 5.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-5). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 5. Historically, Periods 1-4 averaged ~100 units, while Periods 5-9 average ~64 units (48, 63, 54, 104, 52). Note: Period 8 demand was an outlier (104), but the surrounding periods suggest a mean closer to 55-65. With 212 units on hand and 113 in transit (orders from P6, P9), the inventory is currently high relative to the new demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (Avg ~64) and ensure the OR engine calculations reflect the current stabilized state. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is reliable.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders in P1 through P6). The demand regime changed at Period 5; from P5 to P10, the demand samples are [48, 63, 54, 104, 52, 83], averaging 67.33 units. This is slightly higher than the average noted in the carry-over insight (55) but still significantly lower than the initial P1-P4 average (~100). The current on-hand inventory is 133 and in-transit is 149 (from orders in P9 and P10). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the OR system evaluates demand over L+1 = 5 periods. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (P5-P10). I will use the default method for L since the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed actual lead time consistently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5 confirmed: mean decreased from ~100 to ~67 (calculated over 6 periods P5-P10). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. The historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1-P6 orders have arrived precisely at P+4, except for P7 which arrives later). In Period 11, the order from Period 7 (0 units) should have arrived, which explains the 'arrived=0' message. The demand regime shifted at Period 5. For Periods 1-4, the mean was approximately 100.5. For Periods 5-11, the mean is 69.8. This confirms the previously identified shift. I will use recent_N (N=7) for the demand forecast to reflect this lower demand regime (P5-P11). The lead time L is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is dropping (38 units), and while we have 245 units in-transit (from orders in P8, P9, P10, and P11), the next arrival in P12 (P8 order) is 0 units, followed by P13 (P9 order) which is 109 units. We need to ensure the parameters cover the lead time correctly.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we stocked out, selling only 38 units against a demand of 62. On-hand inventory is now 0. Our lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-10). The demand regime shifted at Period 5; demand from Period 5 to Period 12 has been: 48, 63, 54, 104, 52, 83, 95, 62. The average for this recent regime (N=8) is 70.125. However, there is a visible upward trend or higher volatility in the last three periods (83, 95, 62). To prevent further stockouts while lead-time arrivals are pending (orders from P9, P10, P11, P12 are in transit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for mu_hat to capture the shift since P5, and N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the recent variance. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods is consistently observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by the Period 9 order arriving in Period 13). However, we identify a critical period of missing shipments: orders from Periods 7 and 8 (arrived=0 in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 11 and 12) have likely been lost or significantly delayed, as they should have arrived after 4 periods. This caused a stockout in Period 12. Since then, supply has resumed with the Period 9 order arriving on time. Demand analysis shows two regimes: P1-P4 (avg ~100) and P5-P13 (avg ~70). The recent demand (last 5 periods) is approximately 72.2. To account for the 4-period lead time plus the decision period (L+1=5), I will set mu_hat to cover 5 periods of demand at the current average (5 * 72 = 360). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=9, covering the stable lower-demand regime since P5) to ensure the OR backend captures accurately the lower mean/variance of the current period compared to the early peak.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 7 and Period 8 confirmed lost/delayed (no arrival recorded in Period 11 or 12 conclude messages). Supply chain resumed efficiency at Period 13 with the arrival of the Period 9 order.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a stockout (on-hand inventory = 0) following a demand spike of 128 units in Period 14. History confirms that orders from Period 7 and Period 8 were lost, while more recent orders from Period 9 and Period 10 arrived exactly within the promised 4-period lead time. Demand analysis shows two regimes: Period 1-4 (mean ~100) and Period 5-13 (mean ~67). However, Period 14 (demand 128) suggests a potential upward shift or high volatility. Given the criticality of the lead time (L=4) and the current stockout, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to capture the recent volatility increase while maintaining the core logic of the current regime. I select N=10 for mu_hat to balance the lower mean of periods 5-13 with the high demand of period 14, and N=5 for sigma_hat to explicitly account for the recent increase in variance. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the last two arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Period 14 and 15. The demand regime from Period 1 to 4 averaged ~100. From Period 5 to 9, it dropped significantly, but has surged back starting around Period 10. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P10-P15) is 92.33, indicating a return to the higher demand regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed for successful deliveries (P9 order arrived in P13, P10 in P14, P11 in P15). However, orders from Period 7 and 8 are confirmed lost. Currently, orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15 are in transit (totaling 331 units). I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use calculate for lead time to reflect the 4-period stability for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand return-to-growth confirmed: Period 10-15 average demand is 92.3 (matching Period 1-4 levels), ending the low-demand regime observed between Periods 5-9.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that demand has returned to its higher original levels. The average demand from Period 10 to 16 is approximately 92 units per period (83, 95, 62, 69, 128, 107, 80). The carry-over insights confirm that the low-demand regime (Periods 5-9) has ended. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, although shipments from Period 7 and 8 were lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (29) with a large in-transit pipeline (354) consisting of orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16. To prevent stockouts during this return-to-growth phase, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand mean of the current stable regime (approx 92 * 5 = 460). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to account for the recent volatility in the return-to-growth phase.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) after selling 66 units against a demand of 77 in Period 17. The carry-over insights and recent history confirm that a low-demand regime (P5-P9) has ended; demand since Period 10 has averaged approximately 90 units (P10-17 average: 92.6), returning to original levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders from P7 and P8 were lost, causing the recent stockouts, but the supply chain recovered starting with the P9 order. Given the critical need to replenish stock and cover 5 periods of demand (L+1), I am using a recent window for demand forecasting. For mu_hat, N=8 covers the post-dip recovery period (since P10). For L, I will use the 'calculate' method as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods when they arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. Inventory is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts (demand > sold) in 5 of the last 7 periods. The 'CARRY-OVER INSIGHT' from Period 16 correctly identified a return to a high-demand regime. Analyzing demand from Period 10 to Period 18, the mean is approximately 93.5 units per period. Lead time has stabilized at 4 periods (P13 and P14 orders arrived exactly on schedule in P17 and P18). Current in-transit quantity is 413, covering orders from P15 (119), P16 (132), P17 (106), and P18 (56). Given the consistent 4-period lead time, I will use lead time 'calculate' (which reflects the consistent history). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (Periods 10-18) to capture the current high-demand regime (mu \u2248 93.5). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to reflect the variability of this current regime. The target service level derived from the backend formula (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8) indicates we should maintain a robust stock level to avoid further lost sales.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level following the low-demand regime (Periods 5-9). Over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), the average demand is 93.1 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P13, P14, P15 orders arriving in P17, P18, P19). Current on-hand inventory is low (33), and while in-transit (368) is substantial (orders from P16-P19), we need to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the decision period (1 + 4 = 5 periods). A recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (93.1 * 5 = 465.5) and sigma_hat focuses on the current demand regime and ensures the OR engine accounts for the return to pre-dip demand levels while managing the slightly higher volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed: Period 10-19 average demand is 93.1, successfully rebounding from the Period 5-9 dip (~67 avg). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 93 units per period following the recovery from the Period 5-9 dip. Between Periods 10 and 20, the mean demand is approximately 93.3 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across almost all successful deliveries. Current on-hand inventory is low (24 units), while in-transit inventory is high (318 units), covering orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20. The backend OR logic needs to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). I will use a 10-period lookback (recent_N=11 for mu_hat, though N=10 captures the stable regime from P11-P20) to ensure the forecast reflects the current stable high-demand state (~93/period) rather than the historical dip, while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 10, with an average of approximately 94 units over the last 12 completed periods (P10-P21). Period 20 and 21 saw significant demand spikes (141 and 102), confirming the end of the low-demand trough from P5-P9. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P14-P17 orders arriving in P18-P21). Current on-hand inventory is low (28 units), but pipeline inventory is healthy (346 units). Since the demand regime has been stable for 12 periods, I will use N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility correctly while ignoring the historical dip. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is currently reliable.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level following a recovery phase. Analyzing the demand from Period 10 to Period 22, the average demand is approximately 98.4 units per period, showing consistency with the 'return-to-growth' phase noted in carry-over insights. Recent demand (last 3 periods) is 102, 86, and 141, averaging 109. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals from Periods 15, 16, 17, and 18 all arriving precisely at L=4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while in-transit (pipeline) is 423 units. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock targeted at roughly 500 units (5 * 100) is appropriate. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the stable regime since Period 10) to capture the current mean demand of ~98, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility, especially the demand spike of 141 in Period 20.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 10-23) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 92 units, with periodic fluctuations and occasional stockouts due to narrow margins. The promised lead time of 4 is consistently observed in all successful deliveries (e.g., P19 order arrived in P23). On-hand inventory is critically low (4 units). Pipeline inventory is high (438 units), reflecting recent large orders. Since the demand regime has remained stable for over 10 periods, I will use a recent_N approach with N=14 (covering the current stable period since Period 10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current mean and volatility while ignoring the low-demand dip earlier in the game. I will keep L at default (4).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~96 units per period following the recovery from the Period 5-9 dip. Recent demand (P20-P24) averages 102.4, but the wider stable regime (P10-P24) is approximately 95.8. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand), with stockouts occurring in Period 24. I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat (covering the stable regime since Period 10) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation, which covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), is robust against recent demand surges (like the 141 and 113 observed recently) and accounts for the 418 units currently in-transit.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around its original mean after a temporary dip between Periods 5-9. Over the last 15 periods (P11-P25), the average demand is approximately 95 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low (30 units), and though there is a large pipeline (374 units), the system has experienced stockouts in 6 of the last 10 periods due to high demand volatility (sigma is approximately 22 over recent history). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. To ensure high service levels (profit $4 vs holding $1), I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=15) and sigma (N=15) to capture this stable but volatile regime. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 93 units per period following the recovery from the Period 5-9 dip. Calculating the average demand from Period 10 to Period 26 yields approximately 94.4 units, confirming this stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 25 and 26). The current on-hand inventory is 64, and the in-transit pipeline (ordered P23-P26: 89+62+90+113 = 354) covers upcoming demand. To maintain the service level across the L+1 window (5 periods), I am using N=17 (Period 10 to 26) for demand forecasting and lead-time calculation to capture the current stable regime while excluding the earlier volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $367.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the high-demand regime established around Period 10. For the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand is 96.9 units, and for the last 5 periods (P23-P27), it is 98.0 units, indicating a consistent pattern near the 100-unit mark. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods, with orders from P19 to P23 arriving precisely on schedule (P23 to P27). Currently, on-hand inventory is 49 units with 360 units in transit (orders from P24, P25, P26, and P27). My strategy is to maintain the base stock level using the stable demand data from the current regime. I will use a recent_N of 18 for mu_hat (covering the stable period since the P10 recovery) to provide a robust average, and a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility while ignoring the older low-demand dip. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime after the high-volatility periods and supply disruptions noted earlier. In the most recent 9 periods (P20-P28), the average demand is 101, which aligns with the historical average from the start of the game (P1-P4). The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods, with all orders from P19 to P24 arriving exactly on time (observed in conclude messages P23-P28). Currently, on-hand inventory is 30 units and in-transit inventory is 400 (representing orders from P25, P26, P27, and P28). To optimize the base stock level for a lead time of 4 (total 5 periods coverage), I will use the last 9 samples (N=9) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this accurately captures the current stable demand mean and variance while excluding the previous low-demand dip. Setting L to default ensures the OR backend uses the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 29 is approximately 96.4 units per period (standard deviation ~20.9). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on recent history (P21-P25 all arrived within 4 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 29's demand exceeded supply, though 419 units are in-transit. To maintain a high service level given a 4-period lead time, I will use recent history (N=20, covering the stable period from P10-P29) to set demand parameters. This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean and volatility, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable following the return-to-growth observed around Period 10. For the most recent 20-period window (P11-P30), average demand is approximately 96.6 units, returning to levels seen at the beginning of the simulation. Although individual periods fluctuate (e.g., P29 saw 138 demand), the overall mean is steady around 95-100. Lead time remains very consistent at exactly 4 periods, with no missed shipments since the disruption in P7-P8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 48 with a significant amount in-transit (411 units), reflecting the rolling 4-period lead time. I will maintain L at the promised 4 periods using 'calculate' to leverage the historical consistency. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current stable demand regime (P11-P30) while excluding the early lower-demand dip from Periods 5-9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 10, following a brief dip between Periods 5-9. Analyzing the last 21 periods (P10-P31), the average demand is approximately 94.6 units per period. The lead time remains highly consistent at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by the continuous arrivals from P23 through P27 appearing in the conclude messages. Current on-hand inventory is 58 units with 378 units in-transit (representing orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). To maintain the target base stock level and account for the 4-period lead time plus the current decision period (L+1=5), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean and volatility with N=21 to capture the stabilized regime while excluding the earlier anomalies and the initial high-demand phase. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level dictated by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while accurately reflecting the current demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~98 units per period over the last 10 periods (P23-P32). Recent volatility is slightly higher due to a spike in P29 (138 units). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P28 order arriving in P32). Total pipeline inventory is 358, which combined with 44 on-hand units, provides 402 units to cover demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods). Given the average demand of ~98, 5 periods of demand equals ~490 units. The current total coverage (~402) is slightly below this, necessitating a replenishment order. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable demand regime while accounting for recent variance. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to rely on the observed consistency of the 4-period arrival window.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the recovery from the Period 5-9 dip. Since Period 10, demand has averaged approximately 97.4 units per period. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving on schedule since the disruption around Period 11-12. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 38 units and 377 units in-transit. Given the service level goal (q = 0.8), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 20-period lookback (reaching back to Period 14) to capture the current stable demand distribution while fully accounting for lead-time variability. Using recent_N=20 ensures we ignore the historical dip while maintaining a robust sample size for the current regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~95 units following the Period 5-9 dip. Looking at the last 15 periods (P20-P34), the average demand is 98.7, which aligns with the initial Period 1-4 baseline. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P29 and P30 orders arriving on schedule in P33 and P34). Current on-hand inventory is 67 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 398 units. Given the service level goal (profit $4 vs holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the stable current regime, while using 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat to maintain standard buffer calculations. This ensures we cover the expected (L+1) demand window while accounting for the recent slight upward trend in mean demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 20 to Period 35 shows a stable average of approximately 98.7 units per period, with a standard deviation around 21.0. This aligns with the 'return-to-growth' observation noted in previous carry-over insights. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 27 through 31 in Periods 31 through 35. Therefore, I will use a 15-period lookback window (recent_N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures this stable post-rebound regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for L+1 (5) periods of demand, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost with an appropriate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 10, following an earlier dip. Over the last 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 100 units per period (99.85), which aligns with the initial demand levels seen in P1-P4. The lead time is confirmed as a stable 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P32 order arrived in P36). Current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units), while in-transit inventory is high (431 units), representing roughly 4.3 periods of demand. This reflects the 4-period lead time plus the current period's requirements. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current stable demand mean and volatility, and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period duration is well-established but provides a safety net if drifts occur. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the full protection interval of 5 periods (L+1).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 10, with an average of approximately 98.4 units over the last 28 periods (P10-P37). Most recently, in the last 8 periods (P30-P37), the average demand is 99.375 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, with the Period 33 order arriving exactly on time in Period 37. Current on-hand inventory is low (16), but in-transit inventory is high (396), covering approximately 4 periods of future demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=20) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this long-term stable regime while filtering out the volatile dip periods (P5-P9). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=20 to reflect the current sustained volatility levels. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine the order size, balancing a high service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) against the pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~95 units following the period 16 recovery, with recent periods (33-38) showing erratic but consistent volume (approx 92 avg). The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving consistently 4 periods after being placed (P33 arrived in P37, P34 arrived in P38). Inventory levels are currently moderate (93 on-hand, 400 in-transit). Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime while allowing for the recent variance. L will be kept at 'calculate' to utilize the stable historical observations of 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in its current regime since Period 10, following a brief dip between Periods 5-9. The average demand from Period 10 to Period 39 is approximately 95 units per period. The most recent observations (Periods 35-39) show a similar average demand of ~89 units, though individual periods fluctuate between 49 and 119. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across almost all concluded orders, despite the historical losses in Periods 7 and 8. Currently, on-hand inventory is 85 units and in-transit inventory is 368 units (total 453). With an expected demand of ~95 per period and a total coverage requirement (L+1) of 5 periods, the required base stock is approximately 475 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=30 to capture the stable regime that started at Period 10, and 'default' for L as the promised lead time of 4 matches the inferred actual lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the high-demand regime identified since Period 10. The average demand over the last 30 periods (P11-P40) is approximately 95 units, with a standard deviation around 22 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P31 through P36. Currently, we have 78 units on-hand and 330 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40). Our goal is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over the L+1 (5) period window. Given the stable mean and variance over the long term in this regime, I am using recent_N with N=30 to capture the current behavior effectively for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $334.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the long term following the Period 5-9 dip. Calculating the average demand from Period 10 to Period 41 (32 samples) yields approximately 94.6 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P37-P41) show an average of 92.2, confirming stability near the historical mean. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (ordered P37, arrived P41) confirming L=4. In-transit inventory counts (350 units) plus current on-hand (70 units) total 420, while target base stock (calculated as roughly (L+1)*mu) is approximately (5 * 94.6) = 473. Given we are at Period 42 and the game ends at Period 50, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the robust recovery period while shielding against earlier outliers. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime following the rebound at Period 10. For the last 20 periods (P23-P42), the average demand is approximately 98.7 units per period, with a standard deviation of 21.3. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P38 order arrived in P42). On-hand inventory is 87, and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 320 units (orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 will capture the current stable demand distribution while filtering out the historical volatility and the low-demand trough of P5-P9. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while maintaining the target service level based on the current profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a high-demand regime since Period 10, following a brief dip between Periods 5-9. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P34-P43) is 88.1 units, while the average over the last 20 periods is approximately 95 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, with the arrival from the P39 order confirmed in the Period 43 conclude message. Current inventory status shows on-hand stock of 54 units and in-transit volume of 396 units. To maintain the service level across the (L+1) period risk horizon (5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the long-term stable behavior of this regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers expected demand while hedging against the moderate observed variance.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 95-100 units following the return-to-growth period. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 93.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P41-P45). On-hand inventory is 53 units, and the pipeline inventory is 352 units. Using recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=10 allows the OR backend to capture the current stable regime while ignoring the historical volatility and the low-demand dip. The critical focus is maintaining a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) without over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the high-demand regime identified since Period 10, with an average demand of approximately 95 units per period. Recent performance (Periods 40-46) shows mean demand of 100.5, confirming the stability of this forecast. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 42 order in Period 46. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. Current on-hand is 25 units, and 346 units are in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable high-demand regime (approx. 95-100 units/period) while maintaining the proven lead time of 4 periods to ensure the inventory pipeline remains full enough to avoid stockouts in the final stages without excessive overstocking.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in the current regime (roughly Period 10 to present), with an average demand of approximately 95 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 43 order in Period 47. We are currently at Period 48, with only three periods remaining in the simulation (48, 49, 50). I am using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable demand mean and variance while filtering out the early low-demand dip. The pipeline inventory (361) and on-hand (43) are sufficient to cover expected demand for the remaining periods (approx 95 * 3 = 285). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally moderate ordering to avoid excessive terminal inventory given that we only have 3 periods of demand left but a lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $414.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of ~95 units since the recovery noted in Period 16. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is 99.7. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history, including the most recent arrivals in Periods 47 and 48. Currently, the system is at Period 49, with a small on-hand inventory of 14 units and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 406 units. Given the desired service level (calculated as profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1) = 80%), and a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the long-term stable regime since Period 20, providing enough data for an accurate standard deviation while reflecting the current average demand. Method 'calculate' for L is appropriate given the consistency of lead times observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 10, following an earlier dip. Over the last 40 periods (P10-P49), the mean demand is approximately 96.6 units per period. The most recent 10 periods (P40-P49) show a slightly higher mean of 110.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0, reflecting a minor recent upward trend and increased volatility compared to the long-term stable average. Lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods throughout the entire history (excluding a documented loss around Period 7-8). Given that this is Period 50 (the final period), the objective is to satisfy the final demand cycle while minimizing ending inventory. However, the OR backend logic automatically handles the base-stock level; I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand intensity and volatility, ensuring sufficient stock for the lead time duration while the OR backend's inventory-on-hand subtraction logic manages the final order amount.
