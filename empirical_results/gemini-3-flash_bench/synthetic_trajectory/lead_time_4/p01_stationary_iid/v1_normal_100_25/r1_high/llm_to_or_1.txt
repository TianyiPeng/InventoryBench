Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with no inventory and no history of arrivals. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 5 demand samples (mean = 91.8, std = 18.2). Using the promised lead time of 4, the review+lead window is 1+4=5 periods. My goal is to ensure the base stock covers this 5-period window. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=5) to capture the initial stats and 'default' for lead time since no actual lead time data is yet available.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 118 units were ordered, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly 'in-transit' and won't arrive until Period 5 (concluded in Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, meaning all demand in Period 1 (108 units) was lost. The demand history across 5 historical samples plus Period 1 (100, 69, 92, 77, 111, 108) shows a mean of approximately 92.8. There is no evidence yet of a lead time shift or a demand regime change. I will use 'default' for L and sigma_hat to rely on promised lead time and historical variance. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples) to capture the most recent demand average (approx 93) which, with L=4, targets a base stock covering (1+4)*93 units to mitigate the current stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 100, P2: 69, P3: 92, P4: 77, P5: 111 (from samples provided) and the actual demand in the game so far was P1: 108 and P2: 124. This suggests a slightly higher demand regime than the initial samples. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, orders from P1 and P2 have not arrived yet (expected arrival at P5 and P6 respectively). Current on-hand is 0, meaning we have lost sales. I will set L to 'default' (4) as no actual lead-time data can be confirmed yet. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand trend (average of the last two game periods + recent samples). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the current variability.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1-3 have not yet arrived (P1 order is expected to arrive in Period 5). Consequently, on-hand inventory has been 0, leading to lost sales for the first 3 periods. The total in-transit units (372) match the sum of orders from P1-P3 (118+121+133). Historical demand for the first 5 samples provided in the prompt (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) shows a mean of 89.8. However, the game history for P1-P3 shows demands of 108, 124, and 85 (mean = 105.6). I will use the recent 3 periods of game history to set the demand forecast. Since the promised lead time is 4, the OR backend requires parameters covering (1+L) = 5 periods. I am setting L to default (4), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the slightly higher demand observed in-game compared to the provided samples, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (118 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-4 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost orders. Total in-transit is 510 units (sum of orders from P1-P4: 118+121+133+138). Current on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales since demand cannot be met until the first arrival. Historical demand mean is approx 92.2 [(100+69+92+77+111)/5]. I will use the default lead time (4) and calculate demand parameters based on all 5 available samples (recent_N=5) to capture the initial variance while waiting for the first delivery to confirm lead time reliability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1882.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order from Period 1 (118 units) arrived in Period 5 after the promised lead time of 4 periods, confirming the actual lead time L=4. This arrival allowed us to satisfy demand for the first time in Period 5. The total lead time + review period is 5 (L+1). Based on the 5 historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111), the average demand is ~89.8 units per period. I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat as the lead time is currently stable at the promised value and volatility is moderate. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior, which will set the base stock level to cover approximately 5 periods of forecasted demand (449 units). This aligns well with our current in-transit inventory of 459 units, ensuring we maintain high service levels without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1821.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory system has finally begun resolving arrivals. Orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. This confirms that the lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand for the last 6 periods has been: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98. The mean demand is approximately 99 units per period. Since the initial stockouts were due to the lead time gap and not a demand surge, I will continue using a baseline forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the actual realized demand variance and mean now that we have a stable history. The pipeline (In-transit: 421) and on-hand (41) are being compared by the OR backend against a base stock target built for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. 5 * 99 = 495, which is close to our current total inventory (462), so the order size will naturally normalize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2266.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from Period 5, 6, and 7 confirms that the actual lead time is indeed 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). The demand history shows a slight upward trend or variance (108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98, 122). The average demand over these 7 periods is approximately 102 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 52 and in-transit is 381. Since the lead time is consistent with the promised value, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent local demand behavior while smoothing out the early period fluctuations. This covers approximately one full lead time cycle (L+1=5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2230.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are looking at a system where the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as evidenced by the arrivals from Periods 1 through 4 all concluding with an actual lead time of 4. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged ~105 units per period. Specifically, Period 5-8 demand (100, 98, 122, 121) shows a slight upward trend compared to the initial samples (100, 69, 92, 77). I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture this slight increase (avg ~110), while keeping the lead time at the stable observed value of 4. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, accounting for the current on-hand inventory (69) and the significant pipeline (356).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2584.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the ending on-hand inventory dropped to 0 because demand (145) exceeded the available stock (136). The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 5). Current demand shows an upward trend (145 in P9, 121 in P8, 122 in P7), compared to the earlier mean (~100). To prevent further stockouts and account for the higher recent demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The in-transit pipeline of 428 units covers upcoming periods, but we must maintain a high base stock to handle the 4-period lead time. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%), so capturing the recent higher variance is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~129 units (+29%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that demand has shifted upward significantly. Historical demand for the first 5 periods averaged ~99 units, while the subsequent 5 periods (P6-P10) averaged ~120 units, with a peak of 145 in P9. The last 4 periods specifically (P7-P10) show a mean of 125.75 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) due to underestimating the demand surge in P9 and P10. To recover and maintain a high service level, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime of ~126 units/period (total 630 units for L+1). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the increased volatility including the recent spike. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1687.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods based on history (P1-P7 arrivals confirmed). Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). A demand regime shift was noted starting around Period 7. Demand from P7 to P11 was: 122, 121, 145, 115, 89. Excluding P11 (which might be a slight dip or noise), the mean is approximately 118.4. However, considering the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the average is 118.4. Using N=5 for mu_hat will capture this elevated demand shift while smoothing the recent dip in P11. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility in this higher demand regime. L is set to calculated as the observed lead times have been consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a distinct shift around Period 7. From Period 1-6, the mean demand was ~99 units. From Period 7-12, the mean demand increased to 115.6 units (122, 121, 145, 115, 89, 102). Although Period 11 and 12 were lower, the overall regime remains elevated compared to the start. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P12). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (15 units) and we have experienced stockouts in P9 and P10. Therefore, I am using a recent window (N=6) for demand parameters to capture this higher regime and ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to handle the ~116 avg demand across the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1-P9 orders all arrived exactly with L=4). Demand has shown significant volatility recently. While a regime shift to ~129 was noted in P10, demand in P11-P13 dropped (89, 102, 73), bringing the most recent 7-period average (P7-P13) to approximately 104 units, which is close to the long-term average. Given the promised lead time of 4, our base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Pipeline inventory is healthy (495 units), and we have 81 units on-hand. To balance the service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) against the recent demand fluctuations, I am using 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the data since the previously identified shift while smoothing out the very recent dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1030.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. While a regime shift was identified at Period 7 (mean demand increase), the most recent four periods (P11-P14) have seen a cooling trend with demand values of 89, 102, 73, and 63. This suggests the initial spike may have been a temporary fluctuation rather than a permanent step-change, or we are entering a lower demand phase. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (167) and substantial in-transit volume (406), I need to calibrate parameters to avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for potential return to the previous higher mean. I will use recent_N=8 for demand-related parameters to capture this recent cooling while acknowledging the earlier peak (Periods 7-10). Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2514.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift towards higher volatility but fluctuates around a mean that is relatively consistent with recent periods. I am analyzing the demand from Period 7 to Period 15. Although the Carry-over insight noted a shift in Period 10, the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) show demand of 89, 102, 73, 63, and 142. This averages to approximately 94 units/period, which is lower than the previous regime but with a very high spike in Period 15. To balance the risk of stockouts from spikes like Period 15 against the holding cost from the current high on-hand inventory (184), I will use the last 9 periods (P7-P15) to capture the higher mean documented in the carry-over while accounting for the recent variability. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the regime starting at Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1874.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 16 (where the P12 order arrived exactly at L=4). Demand has shown significant volatility recently: while the carry-over insight noted a shift to ~129, the actual demand in the last 6 periods (P11-P16) was [89, 102, 73, 63, 142, 108], averaging 96 units, which is a decline from the peak. To capture this stabilization while accounting for the high demand in Period 15, I will use a window of the last 10 samples (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the transition from the high-demand period back to more moderate levels. With L=4, the OR backend will calculate base stock for 5 periods of demand. Current pipeline (348) and on-hand (178) totaling 526 units are substantial, but the backend's capped policy will ensure we don't over-order if the forecast drops.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2697.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 7, but more recently (Periods 14-17), demand has shown high volatility (63 to 148). The mean demand over the last 11 periods (P7-P17) is approximately 108 units, which is consistent with the early stage data (P1-P6) mean of ~99, but indicates a slight upward trend or at least maintenance of the higher regime noted in Period 10. Lead times are stable at exactly 4 periods. With high current on-hand (115) and significant in-transit (377), the system needs to stabilize. I will use a recent window (N=11) to capture the demand mean and variance since the Period 7 regime shift, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the observed volatility without over-reacting to the single low data point in Period 14.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with no clear secondary regime shift beyond the one noted at Period 10 (mean ~115 across periods 7-18). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P14 arrived in P18). Current on-hand inventory is 66, but demand in P17 and P18 was 148 and 109 respectively, suggesting we are at risk of a stockout before the next large shipments arrive. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the post-Period 7 demand level while smoothing out the high variance seen in individual periods like P13 (73) vs P17 (148). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=12) to account for this increased volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1127.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 15 completed delivery cycles (P1-P15). Demand has shown significant volatility recently. While a regime shift was noted at P10, the subsequent periods (P11-P19) have shown wide fluctuations in demand (ranging from 62 to 148). The mean demand over the last 9 periods (P11 to P19) is approximately 99.6, which is lower than the shift observed previously and closer to the original baseline of ~100. However, because of high standard deviation in recent periods (e.g., P15, P17), I will use a conservative window (recent_N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while accounting for the recent moderation in mean demand. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering 1+L = 5 periods) reflects the most recent risk profile. Pipeline inventory is currently high (544 units), so the capped policy will likely limit the order size.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted at P10 has reverted; demand from P11-P19 stabilized around a mean of ~100 but with increased variance (std dev ~32).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1833.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 105 units and in-transit is 407 units. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by the arrival of the Period 16 order in Period 20). Demand analysis: after a temporary spike around Period 7-10, the demand has stabilized. For the last 10 periods (P11-P20), the average demand is 99.8 units with a standard deviation of 33.3. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable yet volatile period. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the current variance to maintain the target service level (given the high profit margin of $19 vs $1 holding cost). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows that the earlier spike (Periods 7-10) has subsided. From Period 11 to Period 21, the mean demand is approximately 100 units (sum=1099, n=11, mean=99.9). However, the variance has noticeably increased compared to the earliest periods, with demand fluctuating between roughly 60 and 150. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P1 through P17 orders have arrived exactly after 4 periods). Therefore, I will use a window of the last 11 periods (P11-P21) to capture this 'increased variance' regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I will continue using the default lead time of 4 as it is stable. These parameters ensure the backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current 100-unit mean while providing a buffer for the recent volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units following a period of higher demand and increased volatility. Since Period 11, the demand has fluctuated but generally centered on 100 per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history. Current on-hand inventory is 166, with 335 units in-transit (orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22). To ensure we cover demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), and given the relatively high profit margin compared to holding cost (19:1), a service level near 95% is appropriate. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus on the stable demand pattern observed desde Period 11, which appropriately captures the mean and the slightly higher variance (std dev ~32) noted in the Carry-over Insights.

This represents a significant reduction in volatility compared to the earlier period defined in the Period 20 carry-over insight (std dev ~32). The mean demand over these last 4 periods is approximately 105. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P5 through P23 consistently show L=4). I will use a window of N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent shift toward lower volatility and a slightly higher mean. This approach will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current high-confidence demand pattern while maintaining the standard holding cost vs. service level tradeoff for this SKU.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected at Period 24: Mean demand stabilized at ~105 with significantly lower variance (range 102-107) over the last 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a stable regime since Period 21. Over the last four periods (P21-P24), demand values have been remarkably consistent: 107, 105, 107, and 104, resulting in a mean of 105.75 and very low variance. Previously observed lead times remain constant at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 89, with 342 units in-transit (orders from P21-P24). To optimize for this low-variance environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current stable mean (~106) and the significantly reduced volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) without excessive safety stock, minimizing holding costs while maintaining the target service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2315.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but slightly higher in the most recent periods than the previous regime. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P22-P25) have seen demand of 105, 107, 104, and 125, averaging ~110. While Period 25 (125 units) is a slight jump, the overall variance remains manageable. The current Carry-over Insight from Period 24 noted a low-variance regime around 105, but with the P25 demand of 125, the mean appears to be drifting upward slightly. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this slight upward trend and increased recent volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on all recent arrivals. Current on-hand (60) and in-transit (350) total 410, which covers approximately 3.7 periods of demand at the current average; the OR backend should maintain or slightly increase this position to reach the base stock level for L+1 (5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1435.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand analysis from Period 24 to Period 26 shows counts of 104, 125, and 80. While the carry-over insight from Period 24 suggested a low-variance regime around 105, Period 25 and 26 show increased volatility (range 80-125). However, the average of these last 3 periods is 103, very close to the long-term mean. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P22 order arrived P26). I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this return to higher volatility while maintaining a stable mean estimate. Pipeline inventory (369) plus on-hand (85) equals 454, which covers roughly 4.4 periods of demand at the current average, aligning well with the stock-out protection needed for a lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2112.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent pattern around a mean of ~105 since Period 24. Recent demand (P25-P27: 125, 80, 115) averages 106.6, suggesting the regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights is stable. Currently, the lead time is reliably 4 periods as observed in all recent arrivals (P24-P27). On-hand inventory is 73 units with a pipeline inventory (In-transit) of 407 units. Total inventory (480) adequately covers the (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 525-540 units) considering we have incoming orders from P24-P27. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability and variance from Period 24 onwards. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2109.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P25-P28) has shown higher volatility and a slight increase in mean compared to the previous stable regime, with values of 125, 80, 115, and 132 (mean ~113). The stockout at Period 28 (ending inventory 0) indicates that the previous tight variance estimate was too conservative. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and adapt to the current noise, I am moving to a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=5 to capture the most recent behavior while maintaining the stable lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 25 (range 80-132), invalidating the low-variance regime noted at Period 24; stockout occurred at Period 28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in volatility starting from Period 25. While the previous regime (P21-P24) was stable (mean ~105, low variance), the subsequent periods (P25-P29) show demand ranging from 80 to 132 (mean ~110, but high variance), leading to a stockout in Period 28. To stabilize against this higher volatility, I am increasing the focus on recent data. I've chosen N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this shift (P25-P29). Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods across all confirmed arrivals (P5 through P29), so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 25-30) shows increased volatility with a mean demand of approximately 104.5 units per period. The stockout in Period 28 was caused by a high demand spike (132) following a low delivery arrival (38 units from Period 24). The inventory has since recovered slightly with an arrival of 124 units in Period 30, leaving 43 units on hand. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the recent variance and the need to maintain a high service level due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical fractile ~0.95), I will use the last 6 periods (the current volatile regime) to calculate the demand mean and standard deviation. This N=6 window captures the most recent consumption patterns while bridging the stockout event.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P25-P31: 125, 80, 115, 132, 98, 87, 145) shows increased volatility with a mean of approximately 112 units. This is higher than the previously noted 'stable' regime of 100-105. A stockout occurred at P28 due to this increase. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the current demand level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7), which covers this high-volatility period. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals (P27-P31). On-hand inventory is currently low (39), but a large in-transit pipeline (425) should cover the upcoming 4-period lead time effectively once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high since P25 with a slightly elevated mean of ~112 units compared to previous periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has shown increased volatility and a slightly higher mean since Period 25. Over the last 8 periods (P25-P32), demand has averaged approximately 111.6 units with a standard deviation of 22.8, compared to previous periods. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the current elevated demand level (approx 111.6 * 5 = 558 units over L+1). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=8 to account for the sustained higher volatility observed since Period 25. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P25-P33) shows high volatility with a slightly elevated mean. Over the last 9 periods, demand has ranged from 80 to 145, with a mean of ~111 initially identified at P32. Looking at the most recent 10 samples (P24-P33), the mean is 110.2. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by consistent arrivals (e.g., P29 order arrived at P33). To manage the current high volatility and maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~95% service level), I am using 'recent_N' for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=10 to capture this current regime without over-reacting to single-period outliers.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility and a slightly higher mean since Period 25. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the mean demand is approximately 108.6 units with a standard deviation of 21.0. The lead time has remained stable at the promised 4 periods (arrived consistently at P+4). The current on-hand inventory (82) plus in-transit stock (445) is 527 units. Given the lead time is 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~109, the expected pipeline requirement is 545 units. I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current volatile regime for both mean and variance, which allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher uncertainty while targeting the 95% service level implied by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile but relatively stable mean. Since the shift reported at P32, mean demand from P32 to P35 has been approximately 105.25. However, since P25 (the start of the current high-volatility regime), the mean is approximately 109.9 with a standard deviation of roughly 21. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, I will use a recent window of 11 periods (P25-P35) to capture this current volatile regime while ensuring enough samples for a robust sigma estimate. The lead time L is consistently 4 periods as seen in all recent conclude messages, so the 'calculate' method is appropriate. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the elevated volatility and slightly higher mean observed in the last 11 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained consistent with the behavior noted since Period 32, exhibiting moderate volatility around a mean of approximately 110 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P32-P36) show demands of 111, 105, 98, 107, and 123, averaging 108.8 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (e.g., P32 order arrived at P36). With an on-hand inventory of 72 and a significant pipeline (423 units), the current position is healthy. To maintain this, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=12 to capture the distribution from Period 25 onwards (when the current volatility began), ensuring the model accounts for the slightly higher variance observed. Lead time (L) stays at the promised 4 using 'default'.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit moderate volatility with no distinct new seasonal trend or structural shift. Over the last 13 periods (P25-P37), the mean demand is approximately 107.5 units with a standard deviation of 19.8. The most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) show a similar mean of 103.2. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the system aims for a high service level (approx. 95%). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N approach (N=13) to capture the increased volatility noted since Period 25 while remaining responsive to the current average demand level. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has been relatively stable since Period 32, with a mean demand of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of about 15. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 104 units and 400 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 35, 36, 37, and 38), totaling 504 units in pipeline. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend will naturally target a high service level. To ensure the OR backend captures the most relevant demand behavior while smoothing out recent fluctuations, I am using a recent_N window of 7 periods (Periods 32-38) for both mean and volatility, as this covers the most recent stable phase after the Period 32 insight.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1660.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~107 units over the last 15 periods (P25-P39) following a period of high volatility. While the mean is consistent, individual periods still show fluctuations between 83 and 145. The lead time is consistently 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages (P35 order arrived at P39). With on-hand inventory at 107 and a significant in-transit pipeline of 373 units (total 480 units), we are currently well-covered for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). A 5-period demand estimate at the current mean is approximately 535. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the OR backend will target a high service level. Using 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the most relevant demand characteristics of the current stable-but-volatile regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown increased volatility starting around Period 25. Since Period 32, the demand mean has hovered around 103-112 units. Specifically, looking at the last 8 periods (P33-P40), the mean is approximately 100.1 with a standard deviation of 12.8. However, there was a stockout at Period 28 and high volatility observed earlier in that regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 40 arrival was ordered in Period 36, confirming L=4). I am setting L to 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the behavior from Period 32 onwards, ensuring we cover the slightly higher demand volatility while preventing excessive inventory holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1035.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 181, with 312 units in-transit. In the most recent periods (P38-P41), demand has softened significantly (110, 93, 91, 64) compared to the prior high-volatility regime. The average demand over these 4 periods is 89.5, which is lower than the long-term average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend naturally targets a high service level. However, to prevent excessive inventory accumulation during this current demand dip, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covering both the recent dip and the preceding moderate periods) to balance responsiveness with safety. L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time of 4 periods has been extremely consistent since the beginning.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean decreased to ~89.5 units over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), down from the ~112 average seen in P25-P37.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting around Period 37-38. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is approximately 84.6 units (110, 93, 91, 64, 65), which is noticeably lower than the ~112 unit average observed in the preceding regime (P25-P37). This recent period also shows a lower variance compared to the P25-P37 window. Lead times remain stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 191 units and 295 units in-transit, we have sufficient cover for the current demand level. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this lower demand regime and adjust the base stock downwards, helping to mitigate holding costs while still maintaining a safe service level based on the most recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 42: Mean demand decreased to ~84.6 units (P38-P42), down from ~112 average (P25-P37).

Daily Reward (R_t): $980.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting around Period 38/41. For Period 43, the demand was 62, continuing the low-demand trend observed since Period 38 (P38-P43 average: 77.5). The earlier regime (P25-P37) averaged ~112. With an on-hand inventory of 198 and in-transit of 236, we are currently overstocked relative to this lower demand. The OR backend needs to reflect this significantly reduced mean to avoid excess holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history. To weigh the most recent information while maintaining some stability, I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the entirety of the current lower-demand regime (P38-P43).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for Period 38-43 is 77.5 units, significantly lower than the ~112 units seen in the prior regime (P25-P37).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift starting around Period 38. The mean demand for the most recent 7 periods (P38-P44) is approximately 79 units (values: 110, 93, 91, 64, 65, 62, 68), which is significantly lower than the ~112 average seen in the prior regime (P25-P37). Current on-hand inventory is 256 units, which is quite high relative to this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for high-profit items ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this lower demand regime. This will likely result in lower order quantities to allow the on-hand inventory to bleed down towards more efficient levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 38: Mean demand for Period 38-44 is ~79 units, a ~30% decrease from the previous ~112 unit mean (P25-P37).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2022.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift starting around Period 38. The latest demand observation of 116 units in Period 45 is an outlier compared to the recent average (P38-P44 average ~79 units), but it suggests a possible return to higher volatility or a shift back towards the previous mean (~112). However, I will remain focused on the most recent regime to avoid overreacting to a single high data point while maintaining sufficient safety stock. I am using recent_N=8 to capture the current lower-demand regime (P38-P45) while including the latest spike. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory (182) and in-transit units (167) are relatively high, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a smaller order to prevent excessive holding costs while protecting against service level risks.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 38 and has stabilized at a lower mean. Over the last 9 periods (P38-P46), the mean demand is approximately 80 units (720 total / 9), compared to the ~112 units seen in the previous regime. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), the strategy should transition towards minimizing ending inventory while maintaining a safe service level for the remaining demand. On-hand inventory (159) plus incoming shipments (229) totaling 388 units is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~320 units (4 periods * ~80 units/period) for the rest of the game. I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (recent_N=9) to capture this lower demand level accurately for the OR backend, helping to prevent further over-ordering in these final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2371.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 38, but recent data (Periods 45-47: 116, 81, 127) suggests a rebound or increased volatility, with the 3-period mean rising to ~108. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. Current on-hand is low (42), but in-transit is very high (323), covering nearly 3 periods of demand at the recent average. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the shift from the low period back toward the historical average, while using a smaller N for sigma_hat to account for the recent spike in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound/instability detected: Periods 45-47 show mean demand of 108 units, up from the 77.5 unit average observed between P38-P44.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1574.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we observe that the demand regime has shifted again. After a period of low demand (avg ~77.5 for P38-P44), the last four periods (P45-P48) have seen a significant rebound in demand: 116, 81, 127, and 83 units, averaging approximately 101.75 units. This matches the 'Demand rebound' insight noted at Period 48. On-hand inventory is critically low at 3 units, although a large pipeline of 415 units is in-transit. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand in the most recent periods and the low inventory on-hand, I will update mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. This ensures the base stock calculated (which covers 1+4=5 periods of demand) is sufficient to handle the recent uptick while the backend OR policy manages the large pipeline and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 48: Demand rebounded from an average of ~77.5 (P38-P44) to ~101.75 (P45-P48), returning to levels seen prior to Period 38.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another regime shift, as confirmed in the carry-over insights for Period 49. After a temporary dip between Periods 38-44 (avg ~77.5), demand has rebounded significantly over the last 5 periods (P45-P49), with values of 116, 81, 127, 83, and 135, resulting in a mean of 108.4. A stockout occurred in Period 49 due to this rebound and low on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address the current regime (N=5), I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (1+L) window\u2014in this case, 5 periods\u2014to capture the most recent demand level and volatility (standard deviation of ~25.5), ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the L+1 demand window and rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime starting Period 45: Mean demand increased from ~77.5 to 108.4 (+40%) with higher volatility (std dev ~25.5) compared to the previous low-demand phase.
