Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Initial inventory and in-transit units are 0. Since there are 5 historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the full recent distribution. For lead time, I will use the 'default' promised lead time of 4 until actual lead times can be inferred from 'conclude' messages in future periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 118 units, which are in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Because the arrival happens AFTER the decision phase and demand resolution, the 0 units arrived in Period 1 is expected behavior for a lead time >= 1. We start with 0 on-hand because Period 1 demand (89) could not be met. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including Period 1 actual which was 89, close to the sample mean) shows a mean of approximately 89.8. I will use the default promised lead time and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all available samples (N=5) to stabilize the base stock level against the initial demand observations.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (including samples provided) was 100, 69, 92, 77, 111 (average ~90). In the first two game periods, demand was 89 and 98. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 232 units in transit (118 ordered P1, 114 ordered P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Based on the rules, orders from P1 should arrive in P1+4=P5. Since we haven't reached P5, we have no 'conclude' messages to verify actual lead time. I will stick to the default lead time. For demand, the average of the last 5 samples plus the 2 game periods (89, 98) is roughly 91. Using a 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the most recent volatility which seems higher than the initial samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit (118, 114, 114 units respectively, totaling 346 units). According to the lead time definition, the first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory to satisfy demand in Periods 1-3, resulting in 0 units sold. The historical demand samples provided (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) show a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of 17.5. Since no orders have arrived yet, there is no evidence to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat, and use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (total 118+114+114+124 = 470 units in transit). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and all demand (avg ~101 over 4 periods) has been lost so far because no shipments have arrived yet. This is consistent with a 4-period lead time. I will maintain the default lead time (4) and use all 5 available demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) to forecast. The mean demand is 89.8. Base stock should cover L+1 periods (5 periods). mu_hat (L+1) * 89.8 = 449. sigma_hat (sqrt(5) * ~17.4) approx 39. The OR backend will calculate these using 'default'.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand samples for the first 5 periods are: 89, 98, 114, 101, and 48. Note that the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) differs from the 'Game History' (89, 98, 114, 101, 48). I will prioritize the Game History as it represents the actual realized environment. The mean of the 5 historical demand samples is 90.0. The standard deviation is approximately 25.1. Given L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods. My current inventory position (On-hand: 70 + In-transit: 355 = 425) is already high relative to expected demand (5 * 90 = 450), which is why the previous period's order was only 3 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the full history so far, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat to maintain stability while the environment establishes a clearer pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (Order 1 arrived in Period 5, Order 2 in Period 6). Demand has shown a shift: the first 4 periods averaged ~100.5 (89, 98, 114, 101), whereas the last 2 periods (P5, P6) show a sudden drop to 48 and 63 respectively (avg 55.5). This represents a significant decrease. However, based on the historical samples provided in the prompt (P1: 100, P2: 69, P3: 92, P4: 77, P5: 111), there is a discrepancy between the narrative history and the provided samples. I will prioritize the 'conclude' history as it represents the actual state of the simulation. With an L of 4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory (On-hand: 121 + In-transit: 266 = 387) is quite high relative to recent demand. I will use recent_N with N=6 for demand to balance the higher early demand and the lower recent demand, while maintaining the default lead time calculation since it matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-127.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing 'conclude' messages: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4), Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4), and Period 3 order arrived in Period 7 (L=4). The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Regarding demand, we have observed a shift. Periods 1-4 showed demands of 89, 98, 114, 101 (Mean ~100.5). Periods 5-7 showed demands of 48, 63, 54 (Mean ~55.0). This represents a significant drop (~45%). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=3) to capture this new lower demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=3) to reflect the recent volatility. In-transit inventory (193) consists of orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7. The Period 4 order (124 units) is expected to arrive during Period 8 (visible at Period 9 start).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 5: average demand decreased from ~101 to ~55 (-45%); Lead time confirmed as 4 periods via arrivals in P5, P6, and P7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-97.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The average demand has shifted since Period 5. Historically (P1-P4), demand averaged 100.5. Since the shift (P5-P8), demand samples are 48, 63, 54, 104, averaging 67.25. While Period 8 showed a spike to 104, it is still within the range of the broader historical data but suggests the 'recent' regime is more volatile than Period 5-7 alone suggested. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1-P4 all arrived with L=4). On-hand inventory is high (201) due to the large orders placed during the initial high-demand phase finally arriving. In-transit inventory consists of orders from P5 (3 units), P6 (25), and P7 (41), totaling 69, which will arrive in P9, P10, and P11 respectively. Given Profit=Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand regime while accounting for the recent P8 spike. L remains default.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (based on P5 through P9 arrivals). Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Periods 1-4 averaged ~100.5, while Periods 5-9 averaged ~64.2. Although the Carry-over insight mentions a drop to 55, the most recent average including the spike in P8 (104) and P9 (52) suggests a mean closer to 64 for the current regime. Currently, on-hand inventory is 152 and in-transit is 133 (ordered in P6, P7, P8, P9). Total pipeline inventory is 285. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent 5-period mean of 64.2, expected demand is ~321. Our current total inventory (285) is slightly below the target, so the backend should naturally place a small order. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift demand levels and volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Analysis of history confirms a lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10). Demand patterns suggest two distinct regimes: P1-P4 (mean ~100) and P5-P10 (mean ~67). Although P8 saw a spike to 104, P9 and P10 returned to 52 and 83. The Carry-over insight mentions a shift to ~55, but the recent periods (P5-P10) actually average 67.3. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this lower volume regime more accurately for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 6 periods to reflect current volatility. With on-hand inventory at 94 and in-transit at 144, the pipeline is relatively full, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to maintain the base stock level for the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 5-10 average 67.3 units/period, significantly lower than the P1-P4 average of 100.5. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 5. For the last 7 periods (P5-P11), the mean demand is 71.3 units, compared to the initial 100.5. Although P8 and P10-11 showed slightly higher demand (104, 83, 95), the overall trend remains around 75 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P5-P11 arrivals confirm this). There is significantly positive inventory coming in (40 on-hand + 202 in-transit = 242 pipeline). Since (1+L) * mean = 5 * 75 = 375, and we have 242 in transit/hand, the OR backend will order to bridge the gap toward the base stock. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the lower demand regime while respecting the recent variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we stocked out because the actual lead time for the Period 8 order (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrivals during Period 12. Since Period 13 starts with 0 on-hand inventory, we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (311 units) to recover. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since Period 5, there has been a clear demand shift. The mean demand for Periods 5-12 is 70.1 units/period, compared to the initial 100.5. I will use the last 8 samples (Period 5-12) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. The OR backend will see (1+L) periods of demand requirement (5 * 70.1 = 350.5) and subtract the pipeline (311) to determine the next order. Given Profit and Holding cost are both $1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand; however, the capped policy ensures we don't over-order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we encounter a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Looking at history, the order from Period 8 (0 units) caused a supply gap in Period 12, which was not filled until Period 13's arrival (67 units from P9). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 5, demand has settled into a new regime. Calculating the average demand from P5 to P13: (48+63+54+104+52+83+95+62+69)/9 = 69.8 units/period. The standard deviation for this period is approximately 18.8. My objective is to provide parameters for the OR backend to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 (5) periods of demand. Using N=9 for recent demand statistics (P5-P13) allows us to exclude the high-demand P1-P4 regime while capturing enough volatility to manage the current 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (which requires a 50% service level target). The pipeline inventory is currently 284 units (composed of orders from P10-P13: 36, 99, 109, 40), which should begin arriving next period (P10 order).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing a stockout situation with on-hand inventory at 0. Looking at the history, the order from Period 8 (expected arrival in Period 12) is missing. Since orders from Period 9 and 10 arrived on schedule (4 periods), the Period 8 order is likely lost. Demand has shown a recent spike to 128 in Period 14, following a period of stability around 67-75. To recover from the stockout and account for the lost shipment in the pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~88.5 across P11-14). I will use the promised lead time of 4 as it remains consistent for successful deliveries. Increasing sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) will help build a safety buffer against the current demand volatility and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed lost shipment from Period 8 (no arrival by Period 14 despite L=4). Demand showing increased volatility with a spike to 128 in Period 14 (previous 10-period avg was ~67).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following high demand in Period 14 (128) and Period 15 (107). The in-transit pipeline (344 units) is expected to arrive starting next period (Period 16's conclusion), with 109 units ordered in Period 12 due to arrive now (L=4). Historically, L is confirmed as 4 periods, despite the lost shipment from Period 8. Demand has shifted: while it dropped in Period 5-10, the last few periods (11-15: 95, 62, 69, 128, 107) show an upward trend and increased volatility (average ~92.2). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent increase in demand and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for the higher volatility. L is kept at 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility and mean increased starting Period 11: average demand rose from ~67 (P5-P10) to ~92 (P11-P15), a ~37% increase with higher standard deviation.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 29 units. Looking at the history, the current demand regime (starting Period 11) has an average of approximately 88.2 units (samples: 95, 62, 69, 128, 107, 80). This is a significant increase from the previous average of ~67 (Periods 5-10). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P15 and P16). We must account for the lost shipment from Period 8, which has not arrived. The 'In-transit' quantity of 352 units reflects orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16. To calculate mu_hat, I will use a window of the last 6 periods (Period 11-16) to capture the higher demand trend (N=6). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using this recent window to reflect the higher volatility (standard deviation about 24.3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 units with a significant amount in-transit (382 units). The recent demand history (P11-P17) shows a shift back to higher mean demand (~91 units) compared to the mid-game dip, accompanied by increased volatility (spike of 128 in P14). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate for almost all delivered orders, except for the lost shipment from Period 8. To respond to the higher sales potential while managing the risk of stockouts (seen in P12, P13, P14, P15, and P17), I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. I'll focus on the last 7 periods (P11-P17) to capture the current high-demand regime. Setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the current average (~91) and the recent standard deviation, preventing the low-demand period (P5-P10) from pulling the forecast too low. L is kept at 'calculate' to continue utilizing the confirmed 4-period lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 11 onwards shows a return to high demand (avg ~91) after a lower-demand phase (P5-P10 avg ~67).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted back to a high-demand regime since Period 11. Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), mean demand is approximately 90.25 (95, 62, 69, 128, 107, 80, 77, 104), with significant volatility. The lead time of 4 periods (L=4) remains consistent as confirmed by arrivals in P13-P18. Specifically, the order from P14 arrived in P18 as expected. We are currently facing stockouts because the pipeline inventory of 376 units must cover five periods of demand (L+1=5). At a forecast of ~90 units/period, we need approximately 450 units in the pipeline. I will set L to the promised 4 periods, and use the last 8 periods (N=8) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and its associated volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that prevents further stockouts.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 20. The current state shows 43 units on-hand and 323 units in-transit. A review of the historical demand shows three distinct regimes: Period 1-4 (avg ~100.5), Period 5-10 (avg ~67.3), and the most recent regime starting from Period 11 to Period 19 (avg ~90.9). Specifically, the last 9 periods (P11-P19) represent the current stable demand state with a mean of 90.88 and a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments (except for the lost shipment from Period 8). To project demand across the lead time (L) plus the review period (1), I will use the last 9 samples (N=9) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current high-demand regime while excluding the previous low-demand dip. Setting L to 'calculate' uses the consistent historical performance of 4 periods. This approach helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that accounts for the ~450+ units needed (5 periods * ~91 demand) versus the 366 units currently in pipeline or on-hand, likely triggering a replenishment order to meet the higher demand levels.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-20) shows a stabilized average of 94.9 units per period, a significant increase from the previous low-demand phase. Demand in Period 20 peaked at 141 units, contributing to a high standard deviation within this period range. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival from Period 16 in Period 20. Inventory levels are tight (on-hand is 19), so the OR backend needs to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N=10 to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime and inform mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations accordingly. The backend's critical ratio (profit: $1, holding: $1) results in a service level target of 50%, but the backend capping policy and my sigma_hat will ensure we mitigate the risk of stockouts during this volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: High-demand regime (P11-P20) average stabilized at 94.9 units/period with increased volatility (peaks > 140). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that stabilized from Period 11 onwards. The most recent 10 periods (P12-P21) show an average demand of approximately 95.4 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~25), including peaks over 140. Despite a promised lead time of 4, a shipment from Period 8 was lost, though subsequent arrivals (P9-P17) have consistently shown a 4-period lead time. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to high demand outpacing arrivals. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand regime (starting P11) and ensure parameters account for the increased mean and volatility. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead time has been consistently 4 units (excluding the outlier/lost shipment), allowing the OR engine to use the historical average.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that stabilized from Period 11 onwards. The average demand from Period 11 to Period 22 is approximately 94.7 units, which is significantly higher than the low-demand trough (P5-P10: ~67 units). Recent periods (P20-P22) have shown continued stockouts (on-hand 0 at conclusion) despite significant in-transit inventory, indicating that the pipeline is not yet large enough to meet the current (L+1) demand window. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by sequential arrivals from P1-P7 and P9-P18 (P8 was lost). I am selecting recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (P11-P22). This allows \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the current mean and volatility while ignoring the older low-demand phase. This strategy aims to rebuild on-hand inventory to prevent further lost sales during the 4-period lead time wait.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P11-P23) shows a stable but volatile mean of approximately 93.6 units per period, with significant spikes (e.g., P20 at 141). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with arrivals for P17, P18, and P19 successfully concluding in P21, P22, and P23. The inventory level is currently very low (6 units). To ensure the OR backend captures this higher demand regime and its volatility, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13, corresponding to the start of the current high-demand stabilization at Period 11. This helps maintain a higher service level to avoid stockouts observed in recent periods while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime (starting Period 11) remains steady with an average demand of approximately 95.8 units/period over the last 14 periods (P11-P24). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P21, P22, P24), indicating that recent demand is consistently outpacing our arrival sequence. Although the pipeline is large (376 units), the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning we are currently reacting to orders placed in Periods 21-24. Using recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this sustained high-demand regime effectively while acknowledging the increased volatility (peaks of 141 and 128). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods (excluding the Period 8 loss). Maximizing the service level is critical since profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are balanced, but stockouts are frequent.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P11-P24) stabilized: average demand 95.8 units/period (compared to ~67 during P5-P10), with noticeable stockouts in P21, P22, and P24.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 11, with an average of approximately 96.4 units over the last 15 periods (P11-P25). Recent performance shows persistent stockouts (P21, P22, P24) despite regular arrivals, indicating that the inventory levels need to be more robust to handle demand peaks which have reached as high as 141. The current on-hand inventory is 33 with 335 units in transit (covering roughly 3.5 periods of demand at the current rate). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P25 arrival was ordered in P21). To ensure high service levels and avoid further lost sales in this high-volatility regime, I will use a 15-period lookback (recent_N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean (approx 96) and its significant volatility. L is set to calculate to maintain the 4-period lead time assumption confirmed by recent history.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P11-P25) stabilized with mean ~96.4 and high volatility; stockouts in 3 of the last 5 periods (P21, P22, P24) necessitate higher base stock levels.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized into a high-demand phase with an average of approximately 96.6 units per period (P11-P26). Recent volatility remains high, with frequent stockouts occurring between P21-P24 due to the backend's inability to account for the Period 8 lost shipment and the L+1 cycle properly. Period 26 ending on-hand inventory is 56, and there is a healthy pipeline of 320 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in P25 and P26. I will use recent_N with N=16 (covering the duration of the current high-demand regime since P11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is calculated using the most relevant demand statistics. Since the backend policy is Profit/(Profit+Holding) which equals 0.5 (z=0), the target base stock will be roughly (1+L)*mean. This ensures we cover demand during the lead time and the current period, minimizing stockouts which have been problematic recently.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable in a high-demand phase that began around Period 11. Analysis of the period P11-P27 shows an average demand of approximately 94.6 units per period, with significant volatility (standard deviation ~22.6). Currently, we are in Period 28 with 8 units on-hand and 364 units in-transit (P24-P27 orders). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P23 order arrived in P27). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the current regime from P11 to P27) to capture both the centered mean and the high volatility of this period, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that minimizes stockouts while balancing the equal $1 profit/holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a higher-demand regime since Period 11, with an average of approximately 95 units per period. Recent periods have seen frequent stockouts (P21, P22, P24, P28) due to the demand being slightly higher than the arriving shipments and high volatility. Specifically, at Period 29, we start with 0 On-hand inventory. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime started around Period 11 and has remained relatively stable (P11-P28 total 18 samples), I will use N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N for both allows the OR backend to capture the current mean (~95) and the higher volatility observed recently, effectively setting a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) while accounting for the current stockout risk.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 11. Over the last 19 periods (P11-P29), the average demand is approximately 96.8 units per period, with significant volatility (peaks up to 141). Recent stockouts in Period 28 and Period 29 (on-hand 0 at end of period) indicate that the current base stock is occasionally insufficient to cover demand spikes during the 4-period lead time. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs, I will use a N=19 period lookback for the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime accurately. This N covers the entire period from the detected regime shift at P11 to the most recent observation in P29.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P11-P29) confirmed: average demand ~96.8 units/period with high volatility; stockouts in P28-P29 confirm the need for parameters tuned to this higher mean and variance.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 11, with an average of approximately 96 units per period and significant volatility. Recent stockouts (Periods 28 and 29) indicate that my inventory levels were insufficient to meet demand peaks reaching over 130 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the Period 26 order arriving in Period 30). I will use a window of the last 20 periods (N=20, covering P11 to P30) to capture this stable but high-demand phase for both mean demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for both the elevated mean and the high variance observed in this regime, aiming for higher service levels to avoid further costly stockouts.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 11, with an average of approximately 96.6 units/period (P11-P31 average is ~96.6). Recent demand remains volatile, with a significant spike in Period 29 (138) followed by more moderate levels (65, 85). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P27 order arrived in P31). With on-hand inventory at 57 and total in-transit at 336 (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31 totaling 336), the pipeline is slightly above the current estimated (L+1) demand of ~483. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=21 (covering the current high-demand regime from P11 to P31) to capture the sustained mean and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=21 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this period, ensuring the base stock level supports a high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable in the high range since Period 11, with an average of approximately 97 units per period and significant volatility (peaks over 140). Recent periods (P28-P32) show consistent demand around 100-115 units, with some stockouts occurring when inventory logic doesn't account for the volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P30-P32). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21, covering the entire high-demand regime from Period 11 to Period 31 to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This should provide the OR backend with a robust base stock level to satisfy the high demand and mitigate the stockout risks seen in P28 and P29.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 29-33) has averaged approximately 113.8 units per period, which is higher than the previous long-term average of 96.8 units identified in Carry-over Insights (Period 30). In the last 5 periods (P29-P33), we observed demands of 138, 65, 85, 116, and 115. This confirms a sustained high-demand regime with significant volatility, leading to a stockout in Period 33. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P31 from P27, P32 from P28, P33 from P29). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the current zero on-hand inventory and the substantial in-transit pipeline (368 units), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this higher mean and volatility. This period range (P24-P33) includes several peaks (~113 to ~138) and more accurately reflects current risks than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 29: average demand increased to ~114 units (from ~97 previously) with sustained high volatility and periodic stockouts.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 29, with an average of approximately 114 units per period and significant volatility (peaks as high as 138). The current on-hand inventory is low (31), and we have experienced several stockouts in the recent past (P28, P29, P33). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and adapt to the higher demand mean, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=6 (covering P29-P34) to capture the current regime's average (~107.5 per my manual calculation of samples, but allowing the backend to calculate the precise mean of the last 6 samples). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the increased volatility of this period. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift since Period 29, with the average demand increasing to approximately 114 units/period, up from the previous average of 97. The recent volatility is high, with demand values fluctuating between 76 and 138 in the last few periods. There have been consistent stockouts (ending inventory 0) in many recent periods (P28, P29, P33, P35), indicating that the existing base stock levels are insufficient for the current demand spike and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P29-P35 avg = 104, but P32-P35 avg = 105.25 and we see peaks up to 138). Using N=7 covers the period from the detected shift at P29 to the present, allowing the backend to calculate a more accurate and responsive mean for the current (L+1)=5 period window. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the increased variance observed in this new regime, which is crucial for preventing stockouts during peak demand periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 29, with the last 8 periods (P29-P36) averaging approximately 100 units/period (up from the previous ~96). High volatility is sustained, and recent stockouts in Period 33, 35, and 36 indicate that inventory levels are not sufficiently covering demand spikes given the 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The pipeline (424 units) accounts for orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36. To improve service levels, I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent \u2018conclude\u2019 messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 29 confirmed: Average demand has increased to approximately 100 units/period (P29-P36) with continued high volatility and frequent stockouts (P33, P35, P36).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 29, characterized by a higher mean and persistent volatility. Over the last 9 periods (P29-P37), the average demand is approximately 100.2 units (138, 65, 85, 116, 115, 76, 114, 90, 119). Despite frequent stockouts (P33, P35, P36), the lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), although there are 379 units in transit. To prevent further stockouts in this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I am using a recent_N of 9 to capture the latest demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime starting Period 29: average demand ~100.2 units/period (P29-P37) with high standard deviation and frequent stockouts; lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-41.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 continues to be high and volatile, with an average of approximately 100.2 units/period (P29-P37) and frequent stockouts when inventory is low. Recent demand in Period 38 was lower (49 units), but given the history of regime shifts and high volatility, it is prudent to maintain parameters based on the current higher-demand regime (P29-P38). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With 90 units on hand and 371 units in transit, the pipeline is substantial. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=10 to capture the current regime characteristics (starting around P29) while smoothing out the very recent low-demand outlier in P38. This helps ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased mean and the significant variance observed in this phase.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 29. Analyzing the most recent data (P29-P39, 11 samples), the average demand is approximately 100.2 units per period, but with significant volatility (standard deviation ~25). The last two periods showed lower demand (49 and 84), but frequent stockouts earlier in this regime (P33, P35, P36) indicate that keeping the base stock calibrated to the higher mean is necessary. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P35 order in P39. With on-hand inventory at 73 and in-transit at 327 (total 400), and a lead time of 4, we are covering approximately 4 periods of demand (400 / 100.2). I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility with N=11 to capture the characteristics of this current regime (starting P29).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 has stabilized at a higher level with significant volatility. For Period 41, I am using the last 12 periods (P29-P40) to estimate demand parameters, as this captures the most recent regime shift properly. The average demand in this period is approximately 97.4 units/period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the history (excluding the one lost shipment in P8). On-hand inventory is 64, and in-transit inventory is 306 (orders from P37-P40), totaling 370 units. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures the higher mean and variance observed in the recent high-demand/stockout-prone period, helping to restore service levels while accounting for the high holding cost (Profit=Holding=$1.0).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting around Period 29 has stabilized at a higher level with significant volatility. Analyzing the demand from Period 29 to Period 41, the average is approximately 99.2 units per period (sum=1290 over 13 periods). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as evidenced by the arrival of the Period 37 order in Period 41. Currently, the system has 39 units on-hand and 343 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). Since the service level requirement (profit/profit+holding) is 0.5, the base stock should ideally target the median demand over the protection lead time (L+1=5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture this most recent sustained regime shift. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=13 to capture the recent volatility. The lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 29 stabilized: Average demand (P29-P41) is 99.2 units/period with continued high volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 is stable with an average of approximately 99.2 units per period (P29-P42). Recent demand exhibits significant volatility with several peaks and intermittent stockouts. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 55 and a substantial in-transit pipeline (317 units), the goal is to maintain the service level while managing holding costs. I will set the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the current regime (N=14 periods since the shift at P29) to ensure the OR backend captures this sustained higher demand level correctly. The method used for lead time remains 'default' (4 periods) as arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 continues to be stable with a mean of approximately 98.7 units/period (P29-P43) and significant volatility. Period 43 demand was 77, slightly below this average, but cumulative context shows frequent stockouts when inventory is thin. On-hand inventory is currently very low (1 unit). In-transit is high (413 units), but given the lead time of 4 periods, we must maintain a robust base stock to cover demand over Lead Time + 1 periods (5 periods). The lead time remains reliably 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P39 order arrived in P43). I will use a 15-period lookback (N=15) for both demand mean and volatility to capture the current regime starting around Period 29, ensuring the OR backend targets the appropriate service level given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime beginning around Period 29. Analyzing the most recent stable window (P29-P44), the average demand is approximately 96.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is critically low (1 unit) following a Period 44 demand of 78 units. Total pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 405 units, which matches the sum of orders from P41 to P44 (113+103+119+70 = 405), confirming that recent orders are in transit and the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and frequent near-stockouts, I will set mu_hat using the last 16 periods (since the P29 regime shift) to accurately capture the current mean, and use the default sigma_hat to allow the backend to calculate the standard deviation across all samples, which provides a conservative buffer for the observed spikes.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed stable lead time of 4 periods. The current demand regime, established around Period 29, shows an average demand of approximately 99.2 units per period with significant volatility and occasional stockouts. Although the most recent demands (P43-P45) have been slightly lower (77, 78, 99) than the regime average, the overall trend since P29 remains higher than previous levels. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (15 units) but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (364 units). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, which aims to keep the base stock near the median (1+L) * mean demand. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the demand behavior since the Period 29 regime shift. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for both the demand level and the observed volatility while managing the pipeline inventory effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains high and volatile, with the most recent regime clearly established since Period 29. Calculating the mean demand from Period 29 to Period 46 (18 samples), the average is approximately 98.7 units per period. In Period 46, we experienced a stockout (demand 128, sold 118), leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. I will use N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that started at Period 29. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that accounts for the frequent spikes and prevents further stockouts in the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility, high-mean regime that started around Period 29. The mean demand from Period 29 to Period 47 is approximately 99.4 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=19) to capture this specific regime effectively. This N covers the period from P29 to the present. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 47 (ordered in Period 44). There are no current indications of lost shipments. The backend uses the service level (profit / (profit + holding_cost) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) applied to my provided mu_hat and sigma_hat to calculate the base stock. Given frequent stockouts in the history (most recently P46), maintaining a robust sigma_hat is necessary to buffer against the observed high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime beginning around Period 29, with a mean demand of approximately 99.2 units per period (P29-P48 average is ~100.3). We have zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 48 (demand 107 vs. stock 87). The pipeline currently has 402 units (orders from P45-P48), which aligns with the expected 4-period lead time. With the game ending in Period 50, my goal for Period 49 is to set parameters that maintain an appropriate base stock to cover the remaining lead time and demand, while accounting for the high volatility shown in recent stockouts (P46, P48). I will use recent_N (N=20) to capture the stable but high-demand behavior since Period 29, and use the calculate method for lead time as the 4-period arrival window is consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the store has 0 units on-hand and 419 units in-transit. The demand regime from Period 29 to Period 49 has been sustained and volatile, with an average demand of approximately 99.4 units per period (P29-P49). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, recently confirmed by arrivals in P47, P48, and P49 all having a lead_time of 4. There was a significant spike in demand in Period 49 (144 units), leading to a stockout. Given the stock/holding cost ratio (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level by default (q = 0.5), but the high volatility and recent stockouts suggest using a stabilized N for the current high-demand regime to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. I will set N=21 (from Period 29 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current regime's mean and high standard deviation accurately.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 29 through Period 49: average demand 99.4 units/period with continued high volatility and frequent stockouts (P46, P48, P49).
