In-transit pipeline includes orders from P6 (37), P7 (65), P8 (148), and P9 (155). This total pipeline (405) + on-hand (83) = 488 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand since sales started (P5-P9) averages ~100.4 units/period, showing more volatility and a higher mean than the initial pre-game samples (which averaged ~93). 4. Strategy: Using the base-stock logic for a L=4 lead time, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Required coverage = 5 * ~105 (cautious mean) + safety stock. 5 * 105 = 525. Subtracting current inventory/pipeline (488) suggests an order of ~37. However, the OR recommendation is 115 because it uses a wider historical sample and higher safety factor. Looking at the inflow: P10 will receive P6's order (37), P11 will receive P7's (65). This is low. Demand in P7 and P8 hit ~145. I will slightly increase the order compared to the gap (525-488=37) to 58 units to buffer against the upcoming low-arrival periods (P10 and P11), while staying below the OR's 115 to avoid overstocking as the P8 and P9 large orders (total 303) arrive in P12 and P13.",

For Period 28, our objective is to maintain a pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current inventory position: On-hand (163) + In-transit (283) = 446 units. Recent demand over the last 10 periods (P18-P27) has averaged approximately 88.5 units/period. Therefore, we need approximately 88.5 * 5 = 442.5 units to cover the pipeline. The OR recommendation is 123 units, which would bring the total pipeline to 569 units. However, looking at the logic: pipeline inventory (446) already closely matches our target (442.5). The OR recommendation likely uses a wider historical mean and a safety stock factor (z*) to guard against stockouts. Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a slight surplus is preferable to a stockout. However, ordering 123 units would significantly exceed the required 5-period coverage based on recent demand. I will scale back the OR recommendation slightly to 100 units to reach a pipeline of 546.

Placing an order of 126 units (OR recommendation) would bring total inventory to 575, likely resulting in significant leftover inventory at the end of Period 50, incurring holding costs.

Given the lead time (L=4), any order placed in Period 47 will arrive in the arrival resolution phase of Period 51 (47 + 4 = 51). Because the game concludes at the end of Period 50, an order placed now will never arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the final ending inventory. Currently, we have 140 units on-hand and 285 units in-transit.

Given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) will arrive during Period 52, which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, the only available inventory for the remainder of the game is the current on-hand stock (147 units) and the orders already in transit that were placed on Periods 44, 45, 46, and 47. Specifically, the order from Period 44 (94 units) is expected to arrive in Period 48, Period 45 (93 units) in Period 49, and Period 46 (40 units) in Period 50. Total inventory available to satisfy demand through Period 50 is 147 + 94 + 93 + 40 = 374 units. Average historical demand is approximately 92 units/period. The total expected demand for the remaining 3 periods is ~276 units, meaning we are already overstocked relative to the remaining horizon. Placing an order now would only incur holding costs in future periods if the game were longer, but since it ends at Period 50, any new order would simply be a waste of capital or result in excessive ending inventory if it could arrive earlier.
