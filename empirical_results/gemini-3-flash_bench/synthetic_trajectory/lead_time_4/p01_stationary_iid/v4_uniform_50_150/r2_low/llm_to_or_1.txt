Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we are in Period 1, we have no historical lead time arrivals to calculate an actual lead time deviation. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Given the demand history [130, 88, 64, 58, 129], the mean is approximately 93.8. I will use the 'default' method for L (L=4), mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish an initial baseline. Since the OR backend uses (1+L) for the review cycle plus lead time, setting methods to default will base calculations on the provided 5 demand samples. The inventory starts at 0, so the first order must cover demand for the lead time duration to reach a steady state once shipments arrive in Period 5/6.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The game started with 0 inventory. In Period 1, we ordered 151 units, which are now in-transit. Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect these units to arrive in Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message). Consequently, we will face lost sales until the first order arrives. Demand in Period 1 was 95 (historical samples showed 130). The historical mean demand across 5 samples is 93.8. To calculate mu_hat, we use (1+L) * mean. With L=4, (1+4) * 93.8 = 469. For sigma_hat, we use sqrt(1+4) * std(130, 88, 64, 58, 129) \u2248 2.236 * 34.6 \u2248 77. The OR backend will use these to determine the base stock. I will use the 'default' method for L to stick to the promised 4 periods since no arrival data exists yet to contradict it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' to utilize all historical samples for stability at this early stage.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, on-hand inventory remains 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 (total 296 units) are in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (at the earliest). Demand has been observed for 5 periods (130, 88, 64, 58, 129), showing a mean of 93.8 and a standard deviation of 34.6. The order sequence (151 in P1, 145 in P2) indicates the system is trying to build stock for the review+lead window. Given L=4, the backend needs parameters to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). I will use the 'default' method for L (relying on the promised 4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full range of the provided historical samples while the supply chain stabilizes.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit (Total 417 units). Per the timing rules, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 will arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, which is expected given the lead time. Demand history for 5 periods (including pre-game samples) shows values of 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (pre-game) and game demand of 95, 71, 136. The mean demand across all 8 available samples is approximately 96.37. Since there are no confirmed lead time arrivals yet to shift the lead time estimate, I will use the 'default' (promised) lead time of 4. With L=4, the coverage period (L+1) is 5. Using the mean of all 8 samples (96.37), the expected demand over (L+1) periods is approximately 481.8. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize the full historical sample set for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, as no significant demand regime shift or lead time deviation has been confirmed yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history (Periods 1-4) shows that orders placed in Period 1 have not yet arrived. Following the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 arrives during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message readable at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the zero arrivals to date are expected. Stockouts have occurred in every period so far because we started with 0 on-hand and 0 initial in-transit. Demand has been volatile: 95, 71, 136, 59 (average = 90.25). In Period 5, we observe demand is 129. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The total in-transit is 482 (sum of orders from P1-P4). Our forecast for mu_hat will be based on the mean of all available samples (Period 1-5 mean = 94) multiplied by (L+1). L remains at the promised 4.

Daily Profit: $59.00, Daily Holding Cost: $92.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The first shipment ordered in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand over the first 5 periods has been [130, 88, 64, 58, 129] (averaging 93.8). Note that 'sold' units in history were 0 for P1-P4 due to 0 inventory; actual demand is derived from the 'demand' field. Currently, we have 92 units on-hand and 331 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Since the lead time is confirmed as 4, and the pipeline reflects the initial build-up phase, I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean of all available demand samples (N=5) to stabilize the base stock. The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) imply a target service level of 0.50 (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning we aim for the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-85.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Orders from P3 (121 units) and P4 (65 units) are currently in-transit (Total 186). Average demand over the first 6 periods is (95+71+136+59+59+76)/6 = 82.6 units. The product is chips(Regular), and demand shows some volatility but no clear trend yet. Current on-hand is 161, which combined with 186 in-transit gives 347 units. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 82.6 = 413 units. Our current inventory position (347) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times match the promised L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' to leverage the full 6-period historical data plus the provided sample data to establish a stable baseline for this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1->P5 and P2->P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical data for the last 7 periods shows a mean demand of approximately 91.4 units with significant volatility (std dev ~36). Based on the carry-over insights and 'conclude' messages for Period 5, 6, and 7, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: we have 138 units on hand and 157 units in-transit (orders from Period 4 and Period 7). Since the lead time is 4, the order placed in Period 4 (65 units) is expected to arrive in Period 8, and the order placed in Period 7 (92 units) is expected in Period 11. I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=7 to capture the full observed demand history of the game (Periods 1-7), as there is no clear regime shift yet. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (a 0.5 critical ratio).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods confirms a lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). The current inventory state for 'chips(Regular)' shows 56 units on-hand and 242 units in-transit (orders from P7 and P8). Recent demand has shown a clear upward trend: Period 1-5 mean was ~84, but Periods 7-8 saw demand jump to ~145. Given this regime shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand levels (Periods 5-8 mean: 106.5; Periods 7-8 average: 145.5). Using N=4 balances the older low demand with the new high demand to avoid over-ordering while still adjusting upward. L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: Demand increased from an average of ~85 to ~145 (confirmed over 2 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after stock-outs in Period 9. Demand history shows a regime shift at Period 7 where average demand increased to ~145 (P7: 144, P8: 147), though P9 dropped to 76 (potential volatility or outlier). Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (arrived units in P5, P6, P7, P8 matched orders from P1, P2, P3, P4). Currently, there are 424 units in-transit (orders from P7: 92, P8: 150, P9: 182). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher recent average (~122 over P7-P9) vs the full history (~96). For L, I use 'default' (4) as confirmed by history. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to account for the increased volatility seen in the shift from 147 to 76 demand. This approach seeks to rebuild inventory to cover a 5-period window (L+1) at the higher demand level.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. The promised lead time is 4, which is confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5-8. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) because no orders arrived in Periods 9 or 10. This is expected as no orders were placed in Periods 5 and 6. The next arrival (ordered Period 7) is expected in Period 11. Demand analysis shows a shift around Period 7: the average demand in Periods 1-6 was ~83, while Periods 7-10 show high volatility (144, 147, 76, 71). Although Periods 9 and 10 were lower, they were likely constrained by stockouts affecting reported sales visibility, or simply high variance. Given the shift documented in carry-over insights at Period 7 and the objective to balance high holding costs ($1) against profit ($1), I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime from Period 7 onwards. I will stick to the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a regime shift that started around Period 7. While early periods (1-6) averaged ~83 units/period, periods 7-11 show higher variance and a higher mean of ~98, though Period 11 saw a dip. Reconciling inventory: on-hand is low (40), and there is a significant pipeline of 520 units. No shipments have been lost; Period 7's order arrived exactly 4 periods later in Period 11, confirming the promised lead time L=4 is currently stable. In Period 9 and 10, no units arrived because no orders were placed in Periods 5 and 6. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the recent higher demand levels and volatility since the shift at Period 7. The OR backend will use these to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Reviewing history: Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, and P12). Order from P9 (182 units) is expected to arrive in P13 (Current), and order from P10 (188 units) in P14. Demand Analysis: Demand showed a spike in P7 (144) and P8 (147), which led to a previous insight about a regime shift. However, demand in P9-P12 has returned to lower levels (76, 71, 52, 73), averaging ~68 over the last 4 periods. The earlier 'regime shift' at P7 appears to have been a temporary spike rather than a sustained increase. I will use the last 6 samples (P7 to P12) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture both the spike and the subsequent return to normal levels, balancing against potential stockouts. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N to account for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Retracting Period 9 insight: The demand increase at Period 7 was not sustained; mean demand for P9-P12 returned to ~68 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the confirmed lead time remains 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13). The demand spike seen in periods 7 and 8 was transitory; demand from P9 to P13 has averaged 66.2 units, which is consistent with the pre-spike average of roughly 80 units. I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this stabilization (P9-P13), focusing the forecast on the current lower demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently high at 240 units due to the arrival of the P9 order (182 units) while recent demand has been modest. One large order of 188 units from P10 is still in transit and expected to arrive in Period 14. Setting parameters to balance this high inventory against long-term averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-178.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we have 303 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time (L) of 4 periods has been consistently observed in history (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14). The demand regime shift previously suspected in Period 7 proved to be temporary volatility; since then, demand has returned to a more stable state. Averaging the demand from the last 6 periods (P9-P14: 76, 71, 52, 73, 59, 125) gives a mean of ~76 units per period. With a lead time of 4 periods, the backend targets a total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit + current order) to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. My parameters focus on setting a stable forecast using recent data (N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering due to previous spikes, while keeping the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory (303) relative to the expected 5-period demand (~380 units) means the order will be relatively small this period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed that lead times are consistent at 4 periods (validated through Period 14). Demand has shown volatility but no sustained new regime since the retraction in Period 13. Recent demand (P11-P15) has been [52, 73, 59, 125, 102], averaging 82.2 units, which is slightly higher than the whole history mean but consistent with a 'normal' chips demand profile. The inventory position is healthy: on-hand is 201 units and we have 77 units in-transit (ordered P15). With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Based on the recent 5-period average of ~82 units, the required base stock is around 410 units. Total pipeline (201+77=278) is below this, so the OR backend should trigger a replenishment. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and standard lead time settings to ensure the stock levels adapt to the most recent demand fluctuations without being overly influenced by the start-of-game noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (P1->P5, P2->P6, P7->P11, etc.) consistently confirms that the actual lead time is 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 133, with 210 units in transit (ordered in P15 and P16). Based on the most recent demand history (P9-P16), the mean demand is approximately 76 units per period, while the overall mean (P1-P16) is 89.8. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while respecting the lead time (L+1=5 periods of demand coverage). For sigma_hat, I'm using the default calculation to maintain a safe service level during this period of moderate volatility. Note: Current in-transit units are expected to arrive in Period 19 and Period 20.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time (L) is 4, which is consistent with historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14). Demand has fluctuated but lacks a sustained new regime; since Period 11, demand has been 52, 73, 59, 125, 102, 68, 122 (average ~86). Current on-hand inventory is 11 units, with 259 in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17). The order from P15 (77 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (P18), and the order from P16 (133 units) is expected in P20. Given the roughly equal profit and holding cost ($1.0/$1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the earlier noisy data, and 'calculate' for lead time since the confirmed lead time aligns with the promised 4 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 19. Inventory is currently depleted (0 on-hand) following a stockout in Period 18. Historically, lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P4 and P7-P10). In-transit inventory is 395 units, consisting of orders placed in P15 (77), P16 (133), P17 (49), and P18 (136). The P15 order is expected to arrive during Period 19's arrival phase, addressing the current stockout for next period's sales. Demand has shown volatility but no sustained shift recently; it fluctuates between ~50 and ~145. Since Period 11, demand has averaged approx 88.5 units (9 samples). I will use a recent window of N=9 to capture this current behavior for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the confirmed lead time L=4. This ensures the base stock calculation (Target = (L+1) * mu) accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility. Since Period 13, demand has fluctuated between 57 and 125 units. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P13-P19) is approximately 84.5 units, which is higher than the average since the 'retraction' at Period 13. Given the current on-hand inventory is low (20 units) and we just had a stockout in Period 18, I need to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture this recent higher-activity regime while ignoring earlier extremes. This N selection reflects the regime since the stock began clearing out the over-ordered units from Periods 9 and 10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows fluctuations without a sustained single regime change (mean demand for P16-P20 is ~99). However, lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), and while there is a significant Pipeline Inventory (300 units from orders in P17, P18, P19, and P20), the backend needs accurate demand statistics to maintain a buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent volatility (ranging from 57 to 148) while calculating the base stock. The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) imply a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Since lead time is stable at 4, I'll use the 'calculate' method for L. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 10 periods to reflect recent demand variability.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P15->P19, P16->P20, P17->P21). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a significant in-transit amount of 397 units is expected to arrive over the coming periods (P18's order of 136 is due next in P22). Demand analysis shows recent volatility with shifts between high (~140) and low (~60) ranges. Calculating from P11 to P21 (11 samples), the average demand is roughly 88.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 33 units. I will use recent_N (N=11) for demand mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior while smoothing the noise, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while balancing the equal profit and holding costs (target service level 0.50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 14 to Period 22 shows a mean of approximately 100 units (944 total over 10 periods, including stockouts), which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~68. Specifically, the last 8 periods have averaged 102.5 units despite stockouts in Periods 18 and 21 likely masking true demand. The inventory position is currently low (24 on-hand), and the in-transit queue (306 units) matches the orders from Periods 19-22. Lead time is consistently 4 periods per historical data (P15-P18 all arrived in 4 periods). I am switching to a recent_N method for demand and volatility to capture this higher mean and the increased variance observed in recent cycles (standard deviation of ~33 over the last 9 periods). N=9 is chosen to cover the start of this slightly higher demand trend while capturing enough volatility to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: Mean demand increased from ~68 to ~100 units (+47%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 24. Inventory is at a critical low of 6 units on-hand, though 422 units are in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P15 to P19, P16 to P20, P17 to P21, P18 to P22, P19 to P23 all confirm 4 periods). Therefore, I will use L=4. Regarding demand, a regime shift was identified at Period 14 where demand increased from ~68 to ~100. Checking recent data (P14-P23), the mean is 93.4. The last 10 samples (N=10) provide a stable basis for this current regime. The profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which effectively targets the mean demand. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture this 100-unit average, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to reflect local volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 25. Historical data shows a lead time of 4 periods consistently (P20's order arrived in P24). On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a stockout (demand 92 > sold 86). Recent demand (P14-P24) has been volatile but shows a regime mean of approximately 100 units (97.7 units over the last 11 periods). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend's order cap uses 95% for safety. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime starting from P14. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 26. Historical data indicates that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in periods 5-8, 11-14, and 19-25). Demand analysis shows a regime shift occurred at Period 14. For the most recent regime (Period 14-25), the mean demand is approximately 95 units per period. I will use a recent_N method with N=12 to capture this specific regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=12 covers the period from P14 to P25. The on-hand inventory is 83, and in-transit is 329, providing a total pipeline of 412 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the current period plus the four periods until the next arrival (L+1=5). With a mean of 95, 5 periods of demand equals roughly 475 units. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the pipeline (412) is sufficient relative to the calculated base stock.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 14-26) shows a mean of 92.5 units and a standard deviation of 29.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (all recent arrivals since P5 have had a lead time of 4). Carry-over insights previously identified a regime shift at P14, and current data supports a mean around 93 units. With the current on-hand inventory at 38 and in-transit units at 334 (total 372), the pipeline is healthy. I will use a N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics accurately. The holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), so the target service level is 50%, which the backend will naturally target using these parameters. No evidence suggests lead time drift or lost orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 28. Reviewing the lead time history (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14, P15->P19, P16->P20, P17->P21, P18->P22, P19->P23, P20->P24, P21->P25, P22->P26, P23->P27), the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods. I will continue using 'calculate' for L. Regarding demand, the carry-over insight from Period 23 identifies a regime shift at Period 14 where mean demand increased from ~68 to ~100 units. Since Period 14, the demand samples are: 125, 102, 68, 122, 101, 57, 148, 65, 112, 53, 92, 63, 90, 119. The mean of these 14 samples is 94.07, which supports the 'recent_N' approach. I will set N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (from Period 14 to Period 27). This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the higher volume observed lately while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period_14 in a higher regime than previously observed. Calculating mean demand from Period_14 to Period_28 (15 samples), the average is approximately 96 units/period (total 1441 / 15). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages from P5 through P28. With on-hand inventory at 60 and in-transit at 352 (representing orders from P25 onwards), the total pipeline covers approximately 4.3 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use a recent_N of 15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable higher demand regime while excluding the very low historical values. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistently observed in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 14 has stabilized around a mean of 95 units per period. Analyzing the most recent data (P14-P29, 16 samples), the mean is 95.5 and the standard deviation is approximately 30.2. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which means the base stock should target the median demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Current on-hand is low (20), but pipeline (315) is high, representing orders from P26, P27, P28, and P29 (50 + 89 + 129 + 47 = 315). These are all expected to arrive within their 4-period lead time windows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 31. Demand since Period 14 has averaged approximately 93 units per period. The recent demand (P24-P30) shows a slight increase in volatility but maintains a similar mean (approx 95). Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand due to a stockout in Period 30 where 121 units were demanded but only 70 were available. There are 399 units in-transit, which aligns with recent orders from P27 (89), P28 (129), P29 (47), and P30 (134). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments. To maintain the service level while accounting for the recent regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 23), I will use the last 17 periods (P14-P30) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable 'new' mean demand of ~93. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by recent conclude messages for orders from P23 to P27). Demand has been more volatile but averages around 100 since Period 14 (P14-P31 avg ~97.5). Recent demand (P27-P31: 119, 59, 124, 121, 111) averages 106.8. I will use recent_N with N=18 (back to P14) to capture the current demand regime. Currently, on-hand is 0, but there is a significant pipeline of 388 units. Orders from P28 (129), P29 (47), P30 (134), and P31 (78) are in transit. P28's arrival is expected during Period 32 and will be visible at the start of P33. To maintain service levels given high volatility and stockouts in P30/P31, I'm sticking with recent_N to reflect the sustained higher demand compared to the early game.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 14) remains relatively stable with an average demand of approximately 95 units per period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 14 (n=19 samples), the mean demand is 94.7 with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. Using recent_N with N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this specific regime effectively while filtering out the earlier volatility and different demand levels. Currently, on-hand is low (20), but a significant amount is in-transit (353), which is consistent with the 4-period lead time and our ordering frequency. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 33 where demand (89) exceeded available stock (67). Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 14, with a mean demand of approximately 95 units. Specifically, the average demand over the last 20 periods (P14-P33) is 93.95, and over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 110.8. However, given the variance, I will use a window of 20 to capture a more stable mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) for this regime. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods. The current in-transit inventory (418 units) consists of orders from P30 (134), P31 (78), P32 (94), and P33 (112), which are scheduled to arrive in P34, P35, P36, and P37 respectively. By using recent_N (N=20), the OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for the high volatility observed in this regime.

The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 100 units per period starting from Period 14 (P14-P34 mean \u2248 93.6). Although individual periods vary, a 3-week window (N=14 to Period 34 is 21 samples) captures the recent sustained pattern. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., P30 order arrived P34). Current on-hand inventory is 55, and in-transit inventory is 349 (orders from P31, P32, P33, P34). The OR backend calculation with L=4 and recent_N=20 for mu_hat/sigma_hat will target a base stock covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Since on-hand + in-transit is 404 units and 5 periods of demand is approximately 470-500 units, the system will likely place a moderate order to maintain the service level while accounting for the $1 holding cost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 14) has been relatively stable with a mean around 95-100 units. Period 35 ended with 27 units on hand. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. Current in-transit inventory is 338 units, which covers nearly 3.5 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain a high service level while balancing the equal profit and holding costs ($1 each), I am using 'recent_N' for the demand forecast, setting N=20 to capture the regime since Period 14. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as the 4-period duration is firmly established. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' (N=20) to reflect the volatility of the current regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 23 to 36 has averaged 102.7 units, which is consistent with the regime shift noted at Period 23 (mean ~100). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P28-P32 arriving exactly at P32-P36 (all with lead_time=4). There are no missing shipments; the 'In-transit' quantity of 351 units represents orders from P33 (112), P34 (65), P35 (67), and P36 (107), which are scheduled to arrive in future periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0. I will use a recent_N of 14 for demand parameters to capture this stable regime since Period 23. This will set the base stock level to cover demand during the review period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1=5 total periods of coverage).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 14) has stabilized with a mean around 95-100 units. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the average demand is 94.8 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, confirmed by the most recent arrival (P33 order arrived in P37). The current pipeline inventory (373 units) is substantial compared to the current 45 units on-hand. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock effectively equal to the expected demand over (L+1) periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean demand while filtering out older, less relevant data from earlier periods with lower demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained steady within the regime detected at Period 14, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units since that shift. Specifically, demand from Period 23 to Period 38 averages 97.4 units. Since there are no new seasonal indicators or calendar dates provided suggesting a spike, I will use a window of the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture this stable regime (P24-P38). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand is 0, so we rely on the pipeline of 394 units. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock covering demand over (L+1) = 5 periods, which at ~100 units/period equates to approximately 500 units total. With 394 in transit and 0 on hand, the system needs to order roughly 100-110 units to maintain the service level while accounting for the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has maintained a stable mean of approximately 98.7 units since Period 14 (observed through Period 39). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival since Period 5, including the most recent confirmation at Period 39 (Order from P35 arrived in P39). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, with 428 units in transit. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median of the demand distribution. I am using recent_N=26 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the demand regime starting from Period 14 through Period 39. This ensures that the (L+1) period pipeline reflects the current sustained demand levels and volatility, helping the backend maintain a balanced service level.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since Period 14, as noted in the Carry-over Insight from Period 23. Reviewing the last 10 periods (P31-P40), the mean demand is 100.3, confirming this regime persists. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 41 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and the last three periods (P38-P40) faced stockouts, I will use a recent window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect current demand levels and volatility (std dev ~27.5). The OR backend uses these to target a base-stock level that accounts for the L+1 cycle. With a profit-to-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, but the backend formula manages the trade-off. Using recent_N=10 ensures the parameters are not biased by the lower-demand periods earlier in the game.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 100 units since Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand is 98.3, confirming this level. The lead time remains constant at the promised 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (P37 order arriving in P41) confirming a 4-period duration. On-hand inventory is 70, and in-transit inventory is 378 (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). To maintain the target service level against a lead time of 4 periods, I will use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the noise from the earlier, lower-demand periods. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained regime shift starting around Period 14, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (P35-P42) show continued volatility but maintain a similar average (approx 94 units). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrival at P42 from an order placed in P38). With On-hand inventory at 105 and In-transit at 324 (covering P39, P40, P41, P42 orders), the pipeline is reasonably healthy. I will continue using the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable but volatile regime (P23 to P42). This balances the need for a relevant local mean while accommodating the high variance observed in recent periods (e.g., demand swings between 51 and 142). Lead time L is set to default (promised 4) as it aligns with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of approximately 95 units since the regime shift noted at Period 14, although recent periods (P41-P43) have shown slightly lower demand (~70 units). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 43 (P39 order arrived in P43). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 111 units, with 259 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42, and P43). To maintain the target service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.5, z=0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable behavior since the P14 shift, while allowing for recent variance. This calculates mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 20 periods (P24-P43), which covers the sustained regime.

Current on-hand inventory is 73 units, with 309 units in-transit (orders from Periods 41, 42, 43, 44).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since Period 14, following a regime shift to a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 93 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory position: On-hand (85) + In-transit (32+36+106+94) = 353 units. Given the target base stock logic (L+1 periods), we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat best captures the current variance and mean (approx 465 for mu_hat) while responding to the most recent behavior without being skewed by the very early history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 23 at an average of approximately 94 units per period (N=24), reflecting the regime shift noted in Carry-over insights. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as observed from recent arrivals in P41-P46). Currently, on-hand inventory is 53 and in-transit is 361. Total pipeline (53+361=414) is being managed against a lead-time horizon of 4+1=5 periods. At an average demand of 94, 5 periods of demand is approximately 470 units. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level targeted by the OR backend is 50%, roughly aiming for the mean demand. I will use recent_N (N=24) for demand mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 48 out of 50. Inventory consists of 38 units on-hand and 377 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand regime shift identified around Period 14 (mean ~100) has shown significant volatility recently (Periods 41-47 mean ~76), but using recent_N (N=20) captures the broader regime since Period 28, averaging ~89 units. Given the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P48), arriving at P52, or in P49, arriving at P53, will not be sold within the 50-period window. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current state. I will use 'calculate' for L as the lead time is consistently 4. I will use 'recent_N' (N=20) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent and relevant demand levels (avg ~89) and 'recent_N' (N=20) for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for recent fluctuations. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock that respects current demand while accounting for the high in-transit volume (377 units), which already covers expected demand for the remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 49. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated through P44->P48). Demand has been fluctuating but is around a mean of ~90 units since Period 23. Most recent demands (P41-P48) were: 64, 51, 95, 94, 123, 64, 51, 107. The mean of these 8 samples is 81.1, and the standard deviation is 26.6. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this slightly lower demand volatility and mean compared to the long-term history. The backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1) and adjust for the current on-hand (37) and in-transit (324) units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 94 units per period since Period 23, with occasional fluctuations. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent arrival observations (Period 49 shows P45 order arrived, L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 40 units, and there are 275 units in-transit (orders from P46, P47, P48, P49). Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the recent_N method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, using N=20 to capture the current stable regime's statistical properties while filtering out earlier, less relevant data.
