Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical conclusion to observe yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The provided demand history (P1-P5) suggests a mean demand of approximately 93.8 units per period, but since this is Period 1 of the simulation, I must look at the data provided for P1 which is 130. However, the OR backend requires parameters for the current cycle. Using 'default' methods for the first period is the most robust approach to allow the backend to establish a baseline using all available historical samples (P1-P5). Given L=4, the base stock will need to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. No anomalies or lost shipments are present yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 151 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this order to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (demand was 95). Demand history shows [130, 88, 64, 58, 129] for the 5-period sample set provided, and Period 1's actual demand was 95. The mean of these 6 samples is 94. Because we are in the early stages and have no observed lead times Yet, I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' which calculates parameters based on all available samples (including the sample history and Period 1's demand). This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 296 units in-transit (151 from P1, 145 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (1+4=5) and be visible at the start of Period 6. Consequently, we have had 0 sales in P1 and P2 because there was no stock. Historical demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) show significant variance. Given the on-hand is 0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock and subtract the 296 in-transit units. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (all available historical samples) to capture the initial demand distribution while covering the (L+1)=5 period risk window. The OR backend's base stock calculation will naturally account for the pipeline inventory.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4+1=5) and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations for Periods 1-3 are expected and do not yet indicate a delay or loss. Demand samples for the first 5 periods (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) show a mean of 93.8 and a standard deviation of 34.9. However, our internal history for Periods 1-3 shows demand of 95, 71, and 136. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lived through 3 periods of stockouts because the lead time has not yet elapsed. We must ensure the pipeline (currently 151+145+132=428 units) covers the lead time + 1 period of demand. Given L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using all available samples (5) to estimate the mean and volatility for now.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The total demand history (P1-P4) is [95, 71, 136, 59], with an average of 90.25 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 arrives DURING Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, current arrivals of '0' are exactly as expected for a 4-period lead time. We have 542 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4 sum to 542). Since on-hand is 0 and we are facing lost sales until the P1 order arrives, I will set parameters to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I'll use the average demand of ~90 and a standard deviation of ~35. For mu_hat, I'll use 'default' which calculates (1+L) * mean of all samples, as there is no clear regime shift yet. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'default' as well. For L, 'default' uses the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the promised lead time L=4 is confirmed by the arrival in Period 5 of the order placed in Period 1 (5 - 1 = 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 92 units. There are 391 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Demand for the first 5 periods was 95, 71, 136, 59, 59 (average = 84). History is too short to confirm a sustained 'regime shift', but the most recent two periods show lower demand (59, 59) compared to the first three. However, given the variance, I will use a window of N=5 to capture a stable mean for the base stock calculation. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target covering the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have 391 in-transit and 92 on-hand (483 total), and expected demand over 5 periods is ~420, the system is well-covered for the immediate lead-time window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 arrived at Period 5, Period 2 arrived at Period 6). On-hand inventory is 161, and we have 246 units in-transit (from orders placed in Period 3 and 4). Current demand shows fluctuation but no clear trend shift yet; historical demand samples for the first 5 periods were 130, 88, 64, 58, 129, and recent actual demand from Period 1-6 was 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76. The mean demand is approximately 84 units/period. The pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 161 + 246 = 407) is meant to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean of 84, required stock is ~420 plus safety stock. I will use 'default' for Lead Time as it matches the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the actual realized demand variance and mean from the game history, including the initial stock-out periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 149 units on-hand and 176 in-transit (orders from Period 4 and Period 7). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand history shows an average of roughly 92 units per period (samples: 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144). The last period (P7) saw a significant spike to 144. To protect against this volatility and the 4-period lead time, I am using a recent_N window of 5 periods (P3-P7) for demand and standard deviation to capture the more recent variability (including the P7 spike and the lower P4-P5 period). This window provides a balanced mean and accounts for the higher variance observed recently. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods matches the actual performance.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Demand has shown an upward shift: the average demand for the first 5 periods was 84 units, whereas the average for the most recent 3 periods (P6-P8) is approximately 122 units. To account for this recent increase in demand and volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (L+1) = 5 period window required to cover lead time plus the current period's demand. The inventory position (On-hand: 116 + In-transit: 226 = 342) will be compared by the backend against the base stock level derived from these recent samples to determine the optimal order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 6: average demand increased from ~84 to ~122 (+45%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). No order was placed in P5 or P6, which explains the 'arrived=0' in P9 conclude. We expect the next shipment (ordered in P7) to arrive in Period 11. Demand analysis shows a shift starting around Period 7: the last three periods (P7, P8, P9) have demands of 144, 147, and 76, averaging ~122.3, whereas P1-P6 averaged ~82.7. Although P9 dropped to 76, the previous two spikes were significant, suggesting a higher mean or increased volatility. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent higher-activity regime while including the P9 dip. I will set L to 'calculate' as it aligns with the confirmed 4-period lead time. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to reflect the actual volatility seen in the recent samples.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). However, we have entered a stockout phase as of Period 10 (ending inventory 0) because no orders were placed in Period 5 or 6, leading to a gap in arrivals in P9 and P10. The next scheduled arrival (ordered in P7) is expected in Period 11 (visible in P12). The demand regime shift noted in Carry-over insights (P6-P10 avg ~103) is slightly lower than the initial calculation but still higher than the early periods. Most recent demand (P7-P10) shows: 144, 147, 76, 71 (Avg: 110). I will use N=5 for demand to capture this recent volatility while maintaining sufficient sample size. Given the current 0 on-hand and high in-transit (590), the OR backend needs to maintain a stock-up pressure to clear the stockout once arrivals resume.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the Period 11 arrival of the Period 7 order). There was a detected demand regime shift around Period 6/7. Looking at recent demand samples (P7: 144, P8: 147, P9: 76, P10: 71, P11: 52), the average is approximately 98 units per period, showing high volatility. On-hand is low (10 units), and while we have a massive pipeline of 528 units, the immediate stock-out in Period 10 highlights a timing gap in the supply chain. Since the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatile demand level (~98/period) and L to calculate (or default 4) to ensure the backend base stock covers the pipeline requirement. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the high standard deviation observed in recent periods (ranging from 52 to 147).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Reviewing history: Lead time is consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by P1, P2, P3, P4, P7, and P8 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 101, and in-transit is 400 (from orders in P9, P10, and P12). The demand regime shift noted at P9 (increase to ~122) seems to have cooled down in recent periods: P11 (52) and P12 (73) show a return to lower levels. The average of all available samples (P1-P12 + pre-game samples P_1-P_5) is approximately 84.7, while the average of the last 6 periods (P7-P12) is 77.1. Since the 'high' demand period (P7-P8) looks like a temporary spike rather than a sustained shift, and recent data is lower, I will use a larger N for demand forecasting to balance the early volatility with recent normalization. I'll set L to default (4) as it matches observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture both the spike and the recent return to moderate demand, ensuring the base stock level reflects a stable demand estimate for the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a decline following a brief spike. From Period 6-8, demand averaged 122 units, but from Period 9-13, the average dropped to 66 units. I am identifying a new demand regime starting at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all recent arrivals (P7 arrived P11, P8 arrived P12, P9 arrived P13). Currently, we have 231 units on-hand and 217 in-transit (orders from P10, P12, P13). Since lead time is 4, looking ahead at 5 periods (L+1) of demand, our current pipeline (448 units) is quite high relative to the recent mean (~66 * 5 = 330). I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to stabilize the forecast around this lower demand level, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order while we burn through existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: Average demand decreased from 122 to 66 (-46%) based on 5 periods of data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 9. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), the average demand is 76.0 compared to the previously higher regime. The most recent demand (P14) was a spike (125), but the overall trend since P9 supports a lower mean than the total history. I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so I will use the 'calculate' method. On-hand inventory is currently high (281) due to arrivals from previous large orders (P9, P10), and pipeline inventory is 42 (P12 order: 36, P13 order: 6). With L=4, the base stock targets demand over 5 periods. Current inventory (281 + 42 = 323) significantly exceeds expected demand for the next 5 periods (approx 380), but since the the backend runs a capped policy of (base_stock - pipeline), the logic will naturally trim the order size to prevent overstocking while holding costs are $1/unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $229.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has shown significant volatility. A regime shift was noted at Period 9 (averaging ~66), but the last two periods (P14: 125, P15: 102) show demand returning to higher levels (~113). Since the recent regime shift at Period 9 has been contradicted by recent spikes, I will adapt by using a shorter window (recent_N=7) to capture this upward movement while balancing the lower demand seen between P9-P13. Inventory Reconciliation: On-hand is 179 and in-transit is 148 (Total 327). Expected Arrivals: Order from P12 (36 units) should arrive during P16, and P13 (6 units) in P17. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on all previous deliveries (P1, P2, P3, P4, P7, P8, P9, P10 all arrived with L=4). I will set L to 'calculate' to leverage this consistency. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 7 periods (P9-P15) to account for the pivot from low to high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: After a low-demand period (P9-P13 avg ~66), P14-P15 show a return to higher demand (avg ~113), indicating the previous regime shift may have ended or seasonality is kicking in.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical concludes (P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, P12, P13, P14, P16). Demand has shown significant volatility: a low period (P9-P13 avg ~66) followed by a rebound (P14-P16 avg ~98). The Carry-over insight from P16 suggests the low-demand regime has ended. Using the last 6 samples (P11-P16) provides a balanced estimate that captures the recent uptick (avg ~80) while acknowledging the high variance. L is set to calculated (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=6 to reflect this current regime shift and increased volatility. On-hand + In-transit is reasonably healthy, but we need to ensure enough inventory to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: The low-demand period (P9-P13) has ended; P14-P16 show a return to higher, albeit volatile, demand (avg ~98 compared to earlier ~66).

Daily Reward (R_t): $457.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 31 units on-hand and 299 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., Period 13 order arrived in Period 17). Demand has transitioned out of the low-volume regime (Periods 9-13, mean ~66) into a higher-volume, more volatile phase. The last 4 periods (P14-P17) show a mean demand of 104.25 (125, 102, 68, 122). To capture this recent shift while remaining responsive to the current volatility, I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat. This targets a pipeline of (1+L) periods, which is (1+4)=5 periods of demand. With 299 in transit, we are well-positioned, but the current on-hand inventory is low (31), and we expect P14's order (which was 0) to arrive during Period 18, meaning we will rely on the 31 plus any surprise arrivals until the next significant shipment (P15's order of 106) arrives in P19.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory as of Period 19. Historical lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (arrived in P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, P12, P13, P14, P16, P17). Lead time promised is 4, which aligns with observations. Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting around Period 14. The previous low-demand regime (P9-P13, avg ~66) has ended. From Period 14 to Period 18, demand has averaged 103.6 units (125, 102, 68, 122, 101). Given the current stock-out and recent higher demand, I will focus on the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher mean and volatility. Although 447 units are in-transit, the stock-out in Period 18 highlights the need for a robust base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period risk window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 14-18 average demand is 103.6, marking a 57% increase from the P9-P13 average of 66. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 14-19) shows an average demand of approximately 95.8 units per period, a significant and sustained increase from the low-demand phase seen in Periods 9-13. Specifically, the last six periods of demand are [125, 102, 68, 122, 101, 57]. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P15 order arrived P19). In Period 18, we experienced a complete stockout due to high demand and a gaps in order arrivals (P14 had no order placed). With On-hand at 49 and 455 units in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18, P19), we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures the current regime (avg ~96, total 5-period demand forecast ~480). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to account for the high volatility observed in both the low and high demand phases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $571.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 14-20) shows an average demand of approximately 103 units, which is significantly higher than the preceding low-demand period (P9-P13 avg ~66). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=7 for mu_hat centers the forecast on the current regime (P14-P20). Although there is a high in-transit quantity (362), on-hand inventory is low (21). The OR backend uses the capped 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)' policy, so providing accurate mean and volatility parameters (sigma adjusted to recent_N=7 to reflect current variance) ensures we maintain a appropriate service level without over-ordering during this stable but relatively high-demand phase. The system will naturally adjust for the high in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 14. Over the last 8 periods (P14-P21), the average demand is 98.5. Although Period 21 saw a dip to 65, the preceding three periods were 101, 57, and 148, showing high volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (29), but there is a significant amount in-transit (446). Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 80%, meaning we prioritize availability. I will use a 7-period recent window to capture the current high-volatility, higher-mean regime (P15-P21 demand: 102, 68, 122, 101, 57, 148, 65; avg ~95). Using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR backend adjust to this sustained increase in demand and variability.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 14-22) shows a shift back to higher demand with an average of approximately 100 units per period. The most recent demand (P22) was 112. The pipeline inventory is currently 360 units, which is quite high compared to the current rolling average, but this is consistent with the need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 500 units) to maintain appropriate stock levels. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current demand regime (from Period 14 onwards). This balances the recent volatility while reflecting the stabilized higher demand level observed since Period 14. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed history.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of stabilization with significant volatility. From Period 14 to Period 23, the average demand is approximately 95.3 units per period. While earlier insights highlighted a shift around Period 14, the last 5 periods (P19-P23) show a slightly lower but highly variable average of 87 units (57, 148, 65, 112, 53). Given the high cost of stockouts relative to holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), it's safer to use a longer window of 10 periods (P14-P23) to capture the overall higher demand regime and its volatility (mean ~95, std dev ~33). Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. I am setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime and L to calculate to maintain the stable 4-period lead time expectation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $307.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of fluctuations without a clear directional shift since Period 14. Over the last 11 periods (P14-P24), the average demand is 94.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 29.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently accurate based on all recent arrivals (P19-P24). For Period 25, I am setting L to the promised lead time of 4. Since the demand has stabilized at this higher level compared to the P9-P13 dip, I will use a 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level covering (4+1) periods of demand at the average rate of ~95 units/period, while protecting against the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile but relatively stable regime. Over the last 12 periods (P14-P25), the average demand is 92.3, which is a consistent baseline compared to the 103.6 identified in Period 19. The last 5 periods (P21-P25) have an average of 77, but given the volatility (highs of 148 and lows of 53), it is safer to use a slightly longer window for mu_hat. I will set N=12 for mu_hat to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals in P21, P22, P23, P24, and P25. On-hand inventory is 155 and in-transit is 301, totaling 456 units. With a promised lead time of 4, the OR system needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). At an average of ~92, required inventory is ~460. The current parameters will help maintain this cushion while accounting for moderate demand variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $233.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized over the last 13 periods (P14-P26) with an average of approximately 92.2 units per period. The most recent demand (P26) was 90 units, aligning well with this average. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P22 order in P26. We are currently in a stable demand regime compared to the early fluctuations. The current on-hand inventory (127) plus in-transit (304) totals 431 units. Given a lead time of 4, the order cycle covers 5 periods (L+1). At an average demand of 92, the target inventory (base stock) should be around 460 units plus safety stock. Using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=13 captures the current stable regime (P14-P26). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=13 to account for current volatility levels. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is being consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Period 14-26 average demand is 92.2 units. Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 14-27) has stabilized with an average demand of approximately 93.6 units per period. The standard deviation in this relative steady-state regime is roughly 28 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27. My current on-hand inventory is 142 units, and pipeline inventory is 256 units (orders from P24, P25, P26, and P27). To maintain appropriate stock levels based on a target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), I will use the last 14 periods (the current stable regime) to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the backend OR engine. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 90-100 unit demand level rather than the lower P9-P13 period or the initial high volatility periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 14) has stabilized with an average demand of approximately 91 units per period (P14-P28). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. On-hand inventory is currently 116 units with 351 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P25, P26, P27, and P28). To maintain the optimal service level while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=15 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 14. This provides a balanced forecast of mean and volatility based on the most relevant historical window.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but moderately volatile. Based on the last 16 periods (P14-P29) since the major regime shift, the average demand is approximately 91 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 64, and the in-transit pipeline is significant at 327 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (arriving in Period N+4, visible in Period N+5). Specifically, the orders from P26 (65), P27 (86), P28 (128), and P29 (48) are in-transit and expected to arrive in Periods 30, 31, 32, and 33 respectively. My objective is to maintain a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the current pipeline, I will use recent_N (N=16) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average, which includes significantly higher and lower outliers.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around an average of 92 units since Period 14, but recent observations (Periods 27-30) show a slight uptick to 105.75 units. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods. With only 8 units on-hand and 396 units in-transit, existing orders (placed in P27-P30) are expected to arrive in P31-P34. I will maintain L at its promised setting (4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=17 (Period 14 to Period 30) to capture the stabilized demand regime while acknowledging the current volatility. This approach balances the need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1) while avoiding over-ordering during peak spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight uptick in the most recent periods, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging 106.8 units compared to the broader P14-P26 average of ~92 units. The on-hand inventory is currently depleted (0) due to high demand in P31 (111 units), though an arrival of 128 units (ordered P28) is expected during Period 32. Total in-transit inventory is 439 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. To adjust for the recent increase in demand and maintain service levels given the current stockout, I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the latest volatility and volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: Average demand increased to 106.8 over P27-P31, up from the previous regime average of ~92.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent shift starting around Period 27. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 32 is approximately 107.2 units (119, 59, 124, 121, 111, 109), which is higher than the previous period's average of ~92. To capture this recent trend while accounting for the high volatility (range of 59 to 124), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) estimation. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods across the history, so I will continue using the 'calculate' method to utilize the consistent historical performance. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock level that accounts for 5 periods of demand (L+1), balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P27-P33) shows a sustained shift with an average of approximately 104.4 units per period, compared to the previous regime's 92.2. Specifically, the last 3 periods (P31-P33) had demands of 111, 109, and 89 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime while smoothing volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the increased variance observed in this period. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 515 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 33 conclude' (P29 order arrived on time). Parameters are set to ensure the OR engine maintains a base stock covering the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) at the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at Period 34: Period 27-33 average demand is 104.4, representing a ~13% increase from the prior regime (P14-P26 avg 92.2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $261.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P27-P34) shows an average demand of approximately 101.5 units per period. The most recent three periods (P32-P34) show 109, 89, and 79 units, reflecting some volatility but maintaining the higher mean established around P27. The promised lead time L=4 is consistently observed in the arrival data (e.g., P30 order arrived P34). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this stabilized higher demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect current volatility levels. This ensures the base stock reflects the (L+1)=5 period demand window while the OR backend manages the safety stock and inventory levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 27. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 35 is approximately 102.8 units (119, 59, 124, 121, 111, 109, 89, 79, 106), which is higher than the Period 14-26 average of 92.2. Although the demand is volatile, a recent window (N=9) captures this latest level effectively. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals. The inventory position (On-hand: 78 + In-transit: 367 = 445) is currently being managed against this demand level. I will use the recent N=9 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the current demand stabilization and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 27: Average demand from P27-P35 is 102.8 units per period, representing an increase from the P14-P26 average of 92.2.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around 103 units per period since Period 27. Specifically, the average demand from Period 27 to Period 36 is approximately 106.3 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36). Current on-hand inventory is 83 units, and there are 326 units in transit (orders from Periods 33, 34, 35, and 36), totaling 409 units in pipeline inventory. To maintain a sufficient base stock for the (L+1) = 5 period horizon, I will use a recent_N centered around the current regime length (N=10 for Periods 27-36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures parameters reflect the current higher demand level and volatility observed since Period 27.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new regime since Period 27, with an average demand of approximately 101 units per period (P27-P37). Most recently, demand fluctuated significantly (142 in P36, then 67 in P37), but the average remains consistent with the stabilized regime identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time is strictly 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 121 and 367 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P34, P35, P36, and P37), we are well-covered for the L+1 window. I will set mu_hat to capture this current regime using recent_N (N=11, covering P27-P37) and lead time to the promised 4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to default to appropriately capture the observed volatility (+/- variance) within this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 102.3 units over the last 12 periods (P27-P38), since the shift detected at Period 27. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38 (lead_time 4). The inventory position shows 59 units on-hand and 396 units in-transit. The total in-transit quantity includes orders from Periods 35, 36, 37, and 38. Given the critical timing (lead time L=4, review period R=1), the target stock needs to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the current demand regime's statistics while filtering out older, irrelevant data. The Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times have been stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 27-38 average demand is 102.3 units per period (N=12).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since Period 27, with an average demand of 102.3 units per period (N=13 from Period 27 to 39). Recent demand (P34-P39) has shown some volatility (79, 106, 142, 67, 114, 75) but fluctuates around this mean. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by all arrivals from P5 through P39. With on-hand inventory at 47 and a large pipeline of 442 units (including orders from P36, P37, P38, and P39), the system needs to maintain this base stock levels to handle the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will continue using the recent_N method with N=13 to capture the current stable regime since P27.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 102 units since Period 27 (N=14). Specifically, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40), the average is 105.8. I will use a recent window (N=14) for mu_hat to capture this established regime while smoothing recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With only 22 units on hand and 400 in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, P40), the pipeline is heavily loaded to meet the 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time and 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-P27 stability and risk profile.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since Period 27, with an average demand of approximately 102.3 units. Recent periods (P39-P41) showed demand values of 75, 131, and 64, which are consistent with the established mean and variance. The lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. Since the current period is 42 and there are only 8 periods remaining in the game (ending at P50), and the pipeline inventory is currently high (397 units) relative to the on-hand inventory (104 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable regime since Period 27 (N=15) to maintain appropriate stock levels without over-ordering as the game nears its end. Lead time (L) remains at the standard 4 periods.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 102 units since Period 27. Recent demand (P39-P42) has shown a slightly lower average (approx 80), but given the previous volatility and the trend noted in the carry-over insights (P27-P38 avg 102.3), I will maintain a forecast consistent with the established regime to avoid stockouts. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. I am using recent_N with N=16 to capture the full regime from Period 27 onwards (N=42-26=16) for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This ensures the OR engine balances the safety stock against the observed volatility in this regime.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable regime since Period 27, with an average demand of approximately 101.3 units per period (P27-P43 average). Current inventory is healthy (On-hand: 148, In-transit: 299), and lead times are consistently 4 periods as confirmed by previous 'conclude' messages. Recent demand (P41-P43) has been slightly lower (avg 70), but the overall regime from P27 onwards is a more reliable predictor for base stock calculations given the volatility. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering P27 to P43) to capture this stable regime while ignoring the older, lower-demand history. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 27-43 remains stable with an average of 101.3 units per period (N=17).

The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~101 units per period since Period 27 (N=18). Currently, we are at Period 45 out of 50. In-transit inventory is 327 units, with on-hand at 118. The Lead Time (L) remains consistently at 4 periods based on the history of concluded orders. For Period 45, mu_hat is set using the recent_N method with N=18 to capture the current stable demand regime (P27-P44) and account for the (L+1) exposure window. sigma_hat is also set using recent_N with N=18 to accurately reflect current volatility. These parameters ensure the base stock levels are calculated based on the most relevant demand history, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 27, with an average of 101.3 units per period (N=17 for the current regime). In the last 5 periods (P41-P45), demand was 64, 51, 95, 94, 123, averaging 85.4, which is slightly lower but consistent with the inherent volatility of the product. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (ordered P41, arrived P45) confirming this. Given we are at Period 46 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 50. With an on-hand inventory of 138 and 276 units in-transit (total pipeline of 414), we are well-covered for the remaining 5 periods of demand (approx 5 x 101 = 505 units needed). The OR backend uses a base-stock policy. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 (covering the stabilized regime starting from P27) to maintain a stable forecast, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' as the history consistently shows L=4.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 27, with an average demand of approximately 101.3 units as noted in the Carry-over Insights. Recent demand in Period 46 was 64, following 123 in Period 45, consistent with the observed variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 127 units on-hand and 361 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46), the pipeline inventory is 488. Given the lead time is 4, base stock must cover 5 periods (L+1). At an average of 101.3 u/p, expected demand over 5 periods is ~506.5. Currently, we have 488, leaving a small gap. I will use the established regime from Period 27 (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain the current service level while accounting for the high holding cost compared to profit (1:4 ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been stable since Period 27, but the very recent activity (P45-P47) shows lower demand (123, 64, 51) compared to the long-term average (101.3). However, given we are at Period 48 with only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and the lead time is a firm 4 periods, any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (P48 order would arrive in P52). Thus, the strategy must shift from replenishment to inventory depletion. The current on-hand inventory is 115 units, and in-transit inventory is 370 units (92+92+138+48). Total inventory available for the remaining 3 periods is only the current 115 on-hand units, as all in-transit units will arrive after the game concludes. To prevent unnecessary orders, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects expected demand for the remaining periods but ensures the backend's capped policy results in a zero order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=21 (from Period 27 onwards) to capture the established regime mean (~101), which is higher than current on-hand, but the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic (where pipeline includes the 370 in-transit units) will naturally result in a zero order since (101 * 5) - 370 < 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime starting at Period 27. From Period 27 to Period 48 (N=22), the average demand is approximately 96.9 units per period. The most recent segment (P44-P48) has an average of 87.8 units, but given the volatility, using the full regime since P27 is more robust. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game (last observed arrival in P48 confirms P44 order took 4 periods). With the game ending at Period 50, the current order (placed at P49) will arrive in Period 53 (4 periods lead time), which is beyond the game horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current on-hand (100) and in-transit (320) units. I will use N=22 (the length of the stable regime since P27) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the sustained demand pattern and maintain the correct service level for the final period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been consistently stable since Period 27, with an average of approximately 101.3 units per period (N=23). Recent demand from Period 44 to 49 (94, 123, 64, 51, 107, 91) averages roughly 88 units, which is slightly lower but within normal volatility for this SKU. The lead time is confirmed at a reliable 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 101 and In-transit at 337 (total pipeline of 438), against an expected (L+1) demand of ~500 units, the current position is slightly lean but stable. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=23 to capture the full stable regime since P27 and setting sigma_hat with recent_N=23 to capture the relevant volatility within that period. Lead time remains at the default promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 27 to 49 remains stable with an average of 98.7 units per period (N=23), maintaining the long-term consistency previously noted.
