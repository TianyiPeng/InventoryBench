Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, any order placed in Period 47 will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). Orders placed in Periods 43-46 are currently in-transit and will cover the demand for the remaining periods (48, 49, and 50). Specifically, P43 arrival (47 units) arrives in P47, P44 arrival (95 units) arrives in P48, P45 arrival (93 units) arrives in P49, and P46 arrival (100 units) arrives in P50. On-hand inventory is 97 and demand average is around 90-100. Ordering more now only increases holding costs without potential for sales before the game concludes.",
