Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit margin of $19 and a holding cost of $1. This high profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a high service level goal. The promised lead time is 4. Since we have no historical arrivals yet, I will use the default lead time. For demand estimation, I have 5 initial samples (Period_1 through Period_5) with values 204, 155, 134, 72, 108. The mean of these samples is 134.6. To provide the OR backend with a starting point that covers the 1+L (5 periods) cycle, I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this initial trend, and 'default' for sigma_hat.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 217 units, which is currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we expect this arrival during Period 5's arrival phase, becoming visible in Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and a high initial demand of 207 units in Period 1 (resulting in lost sales as we started with 0 inventory). The demand sample for Period 1 was 204 (from provided data) or 207 (from history), showing high initial interest. Since we only have one complete period of data, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available samples to establish a baseline forecast while accounting for the promised lead time of 4. This will set the base stock to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 0 for 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history, orders were placed in Period 1 (217 units) and Period 2 (235 units), totaling 452 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, there are currently no arrivals to satisfy demand in Periods 1 and 2, resulting in 0 units sold and 0 ending inventory. Demand has been declining from 204 (historical) to 207 (P1), then 126 (P2). Given that we have zero stock and the first delivery is several periods away, the priority is to maintain a pipeline that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have 5 historical samples plus 2 game history points, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent trend while acknowledging the early-stage variance. L remains at the promised default.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4). Consequently, all demand from Period 1 to Period 3 has resulted in lost sales because on-hand inventory has been 0. Specifically, Period 1 demand was 207, Period 2 was 126, and Period 3 was 88. The historical demand data provided (P1: 204, P2: 155, P3: 134, P4: 72, P5: 108) shows a clear downward trend in the first four samples. Since we have not yet observed any 'conclude' messages proving a lead time shift or lost shipment (it is too early for P1's order to have arrived), I will maintain the promised lead time L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the trend is significantly downward and volatile; using the mean of all 5 available samples (avg \u2248 134) would likely overestimate current demand (P4 was 72). I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand to capture the deceleration while still maintaining enough safety stock to handle the high early demand if it returns. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, which will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments could have arrived yet. Total in-transit is 904 units (sum of orders from P1-P4). Historical demand has been decreasing significantly from 207 in P1 to 84 in P4. Given the short history and clear downward trend, I will use recent_N with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this drop, preventing excessive over-ordering. I will keep Lead Time (L) at default as we haven't reached the first delivery milestone yet, and use default sigma_hat to account for early-stage volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1703.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The history confirms this: the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4). No orders arrived in Periods 1-4, which is expected for L=4. In Period 5, the first delivery (217 units) arrived, satisfying the demand of 96 and leaving 121 units on-hand. We have a significant in-transit pipeline (687 units from orders in Periods 2, 3, and 4). Looking at demand: P1-P5 demand was 204, 155, 134, 72, 108 (note: the user-provided demand history in the prompt slightly differs from the conclude statements; I will prioritize the conclude statements: 207, 126, 88, 84, 96). Average demand over 5 periods is 120.2. With L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current total inventory (on-hand 121 + in-transit 687 = 808) is ample for 5 periods (~601 units). However, the demand shows a downward trend followed by a slight recovery. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this recent behavior while smoothing variance. L will be default (4). mu_hat will use the mean of all 5 periods (120.2 * 5 = 601), and sigma_hat will use the std of these samples to account for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5). Initial stockout resolved in P5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1264.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Concluded arrivals from Period 1 (arrived P5) and Period 2 (arrived P6) confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods. The initial stockout (Periods 1-4) ended in Period 5. Demand history: P1: 204, P2: 155, P3: 134, P4: 72, P5: 108, P6: 81. There is a clear downward trend/regime shift after Period 3. Mean demand for P4-P6 is approx 87 units/period, compared to the P1-P3 mean of 161. To avoid excessive holding costs from over-ordering based on early high demand, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead times (4, 4) match the promised lead time, providing confidence in the backend calculation. On-hand (275) + In-transit (452) = 727 units, which covers about 8 periods of current demand, so the OR backend will likely moderate the order size.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected after Period 3: Demand dropped from an average of ~160 to ~87 (-45%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $794.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are in a low-demand regime established since Period 4. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 81.25 units, which is significantly lower than the initial periods (P1-P3 avg: 140.33). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7. Currently, we have 422 units on-hand and 241 units in-transit (ordered in P4, due to arrive in P8 resolution). This total pipeline of 663 units is very high relative to the current demand rate of ~81 units per period. With a 4-period lead time, we transition to a base-stock target covering 5 periods (L+1). At the current rate, 5 periods of demand is ~406 units. Since we already have 663 units available, no new order is required. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current stable low-demand regime and lead time L=4. This will guide the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects current reality, likely resulting in a zero order to bleed off the excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 587 units on hand and 0 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift after Period 3. From Period 4 to Period 8, demand has stabilized at a much lower level, averaging 80.2 units per period (84, 96, 81, 64, 76), compared to the initial high demand in Periods 1-3. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P5 through P8). Because current on-hand inventory (587) is very high relative to the recent demand mean (~80) and the lead time coverage required (L+1 = 5 periods, 5 * 80 = 400), the OR backend will naturally order 0 units to reduce holding costs. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the observed 4-period lead time, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the post-drop demand regime accurately (Periods 4-8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $593.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 4. Comparing the first three periods (avg ~140) to the last six periods (P4-P9, avg ~78), there is a significant downward shift. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival data (Orders from P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). Currently, the system has a high on-hand inventory (528 units) following the arrival of large initial orders and lower-than-expected demand. Since the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the 5-period demand (L+1), the OR engine should naturally pause ordering. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect this lower demand regime (P4-P9), ensuring the base stock calculation is based on current reality rather than the early high-demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 4-9 average demand is 76.7 units, down from Period 1-3 average of 140.3 units (-45%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical analysis shows a clear demand shift: Periods 1-3 averaged 164 units (realized demand was 207, 126, 88), while Periods 4-10 averaged 74.3 units (84, 96, 81, 64, 76, 59, 59). This represents a ~55% drop from the initial phase. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (469 units) because orders placed during the high-demand phase (Periods 1-4) arrived after demand had already dropped. With a current mean demand of ~74 units and L=4, the pipeline requirement is roughly (4+1)*74 = 370 units. Since on-hand (469) exceeds this, the OR backend's inventory balancing will likely not place new orders yet. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect the lower demand regime starting from Period 4 to ensure the base stock levels align with the current lower consumption rate.

The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P4-P11) is 73.25 units, compared to the initial 140.3. Currently, there is 403 units on-hand and zero in-transit. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. At an average of ~73 units/period, the required base stock is roughly 365 units. Since we have 403 on-hand, our pipeline inventory exceeds current needs, and the OR backend will correctly suppressed ordering. To ensure the backend uses the most relevant data for this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to use the last 8 periods (N=8) where the shift became apparent.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 365 units with only 12 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a significant drop around Period 4. From Period 4 to 12, the average demand is 69.1 units per period (84, 96, 81, 64, 76, 59, 59, 66, 38). The most recent demand (Period 12) was only 38 units, suggesting a potential further decline or high volatility. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and current on-hand inventory (365), we are covered for approximately 5.2 periods of demand at the current average (365 / 69.1). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally restrict ordering since pipeline_inventory (365+12=377) likely exceeds the base_stock calculated from recent demand. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the low-demand regime established since Period 4. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14. The demand remains in a stable low-regime that started around Period 4. Calculating the mean from Period 4 to Period 13 (10 samples) gives an average of approximately 70.4 units per period (84, 96, 81, 64, 76, 59, 59, 66, 38, 82). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the early periods (P1-P4 all arrived with L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 283 units, with 45 units in-transit (ordered in P12 and P13). Total pipeline inventory is 328 units. With a lead time of 4 (L+1=5), the expected demand over the risk period is roughly 352 units (5 * 70.4). Our current inventory position (328) is slightly below the expected demand requirement, which explains why the OR backend placed small orders in P12 and P13. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples to capture this sustained lower demand regime (N=10). sigma_hat will also use N=10 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime. L will be kept at 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 4. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P4-P14), the average demand is 68.2 units, significantly lower than the initial periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in historical arrivals (Periods 5-8). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 237 units and 131 units in transit (ordered in P12, P13, and P14). Since the target base stock for a (L+1=5) period window at the current demand rate is approximately 341 units (5 * 68.2), and the pipeline inventory (237 on-hand + 131 in-transit = 368) already exceeds this, the OR engine will naturally place small or zero orders to draw down the excess. I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples to reflect the current demand regime and stick to the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 4-14 average demand is 68.2 units. Pipeline inventory (368) is currently sufficient for the L+1 window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1003.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we enter the decision phase with 175 units on hand and 169 units in transit (ordered P12-P15). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical data (P1-P4 arrivals). Demand has stabilized since Period 4, with an average of 68.2 units per period (P4-P15). The current inventory position (175 on-hand + 169 in-transit = 344) is being managed by the OR backend to cover the (L+1) = 5 period window. Since demand is steady, I will use recent_N to capture the lower demand regime effectively. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, N=12 is chosen to cover the entire stable period from P4 to P15. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrival patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1313.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 17 shows the product 'chips(Regular)' at a stabilized demand regime that began around Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 16 is approximately 68.3 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed (Period 12 order arrived in Period 16). On-hand inventory is 112 units, with 214 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). The lead-time window L+1 (5 periods) requires enough stock to cover roughly 342 units (5 * 68.3). Total current inventory position is 326 (112 + 214), which is slightly below the expected 5-period demand. I will use the recent demand regime (Since Period 4, N=13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N for L ensures we stick to the confirmed 4-period lead time. This approach allows the OR backend to place a small replenishment order to reach the target base stock, accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio which favors higher service levels.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand has stabilized in a lower regime starting from Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 17 is approximately 65.5 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals in P16 and P17). For Period 18, we have 89 units on-hand and 256 in transit. The total pipeline + on-hand is 345 units. Given L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~65.5, the required base stock is roughly 328 units plus a safety factor. Our current inventory position (345) is slightly above the mean requirement, but the OR backend will calculate the exact optimal base stock using the recent demand statistics. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 to capture the stable demand regime that began at Period 4. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=14 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 19 shows on-hand inventory at 129 units and in-transit at 221 units. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level since Period 4. The average demand from Period 4 to Period 18 is approximately 66 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrivals of orders from Periods 12, 13, and 14 exactly 4 periods later. The current pipeline (221) plus on-hand (129) equals 350 units. With a lead time L=4, the coverage window is L+1 = 5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is 5 * 66 = 330 units. The current position is slightly above the expected demand, but sufficient to cover variability. I will continue using recent_N for demand (mu_hat) with N=15 (covering the stable regime since Period 4) to ensure the backend uses the most accurate recent average. Sigma will also use recent_N=15 to capture the volatility of this specific regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a significantly lower mean compared to the beginning of the game. For the period range 4-19, the average demand is approximately 63 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 138, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 223 units, totaling 361 units. This total is well-positioned to cover the L+1 window (5 periods) at the current demand rate (~63 * 5 = 315 units). I will continue using the recent_N method for demand and sigma estimation, focusing on the last 15 periods (since the regime shift at Period 4) to ensure the parameters reflect the current stable demand environment while excluding the initial high-demand noise.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 4. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P11-P20), the mean demand is 52.0 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 167 units, and the in-transit inventory is 183 units (orders from P17-P20), totaling 350 available units. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the next arrival (P17 order) is expected during Period 21. The current inventory position (350) covers roughly 6.7 periods of demand at the recent mean (350 / 52.0), which is slightly above the L+1 = 5 period target. However, recent demand (P19=29, P20=28) suggest a possible further dip. Using recent_N=10 provides a balanced forecast for the stabilized regime. Lead time L is held at the promised value of 4 as observations consistently confirm it. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the last 10 periods to capture the current lower demand phase and moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable at the lower regime; Period 11-20 mean is 52.0 units per period, down from the 68.2 average noted in Period 15.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the initial periods. Over the last 11 periods (P11-P21), the average demand is 51.3 units, compared to the previously observed averages of ~68 and ~140. The most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) show an even lower average of 37.8 units, indicating a continuing downward trend or a new very low steadystate. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current On-hand (212) plus In-transit (108) equals 320 units. With L=4, the coverage window is (L+1) = 5 periods. 320 units / 5 periods ~ 64 units per period, which is already higher than the recent average demand. Therefore, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the lower demand regime while providing some buffer, ensuring mu_hat reflects the current reality without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Period 11-21 mean is 51.3 units per period (N=11), showing a consistent decrease from earlier stages.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the initial periods. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P11-P22), the average demand is 46.1 units. The most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) show an even lower average of 31.8 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P18 order arrived in P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is 227 and in-transit is 61 (total pipeline = 288). With a promised lead time of 4 periods, the OR backend targets a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent_N method with N=12 for demand (mu_hat) accounts for the sustained lower regime (approx. 46 units/period * 5 = 230), which indicates our pipeline is currently sufficient. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods. For sigma_hat, N=12 will provide a volatility estimate representative of this stable, lower-demand regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime. The average demand over the last 13 periods (P11-P23) is approximately 45.4 units, which is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insights' from P23. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is 221 and in-transit is 49, the total pipeline inventory is 270 units. With L=4, the coverage window is L+1 = 5 periods. At an average demand of 45.4, the required base stock is approximately 227 units (excluding the safety stock buffer). We are currently in an overstocked position relative to the current demand mean. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (capturing the stable period since P11) will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock down appropriately and minimize holding costs while the inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 11-23 average demand is 45.4 units (N=13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $822.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since approximately Period 11. Over the last 14 periods (P11-P24), the average demand is 46.9 units per period. The most recent demand (P24) was 53, which is slightly above the recent mean but consistent with the regime's variability. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by all arrivals from P12 onwards. At the start of P25, on-hand inventory is 185 and in-transit is 74, totaling 259. With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent 14-period average (N=14), the expected demand across the window is approximately 46.9 * 5 = 234.5 units. Current inventory (259) is slightly above the base stock requirement, but we will maintain the 'recent_N' approach with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to adjust orders based on actual demand variance and ensure a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 11-24 average demand is 46.9 units (N=14). Lead time remains consistently at 4 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Between Period 11 and Period 25, the mean demand is approximately 47.9 units per period. The last 10 periods (P16-P25) have an average of 43.1 units per period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Inventory positioning: current on-hand is 153 and in-transit is 126 (Total Pipeline: 279). Given the (L+1) window (5 periods), the expected demand is roughly 240 units. The current pipeline (279) covers this window. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level, I will set mu_hat based on the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture this low-demand regime and use the last 15 periods for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current volatility. This keeps the backend base-stock calculation aligned with recent behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 11-25 average demand is 47.9 units (N=15). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a significantly lower mean compared to the beginning of the game. For the last 16 periods (P11-P26), the mean demand is approximately 47.4 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P22 order arrived in P26). Currently, we have 116 units on-hand and 148 units in-transit (total pipeline = 264 units). The OR backend targets a base stock level to cover (L+1) periods of demand, which at the current mean would be approximately 5 * 47.4 = 237 units. Given the pipeline is at 264, the system is well-stocked for the immediate horizon. I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture this stable, lower demand regime (starting from Period 11) for both mean and standard deviation, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has proven stable at the promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 11-26 average demand is 47.4 units (N=16). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 11. Over the last 17 periods (P11-P27), the average demand is approximately 47 units per period. The lead time has remained exceptionally consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 103 units and in-transit is 157 (total pipeline 260). With L=4, the base stock targets a window of (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 47 = 235 units, suggesting current inventory is sufficient but needs regular small replenishment. I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 4.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 11. Analysis of the last 18 periods (P11-P28) shows a mean demand of approximately 45.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. This consistent behavior warrants using N=18 for both demand and volatility estimation. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrival in Period 28 from an order placed in Period 24), so L is set to 'default' which aligns with the promised 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 111 and in-transit is 152, providing a total pipeline of 263. This is well-calibrated for the (L+1)=5 period window, given an expected 5-period demand of ~227 units plus a safety buffer. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs at the current lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 11-28 average demand is 45.4 units (N=18). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 11. Over the last 19 periods (P11-P29), the mean demand is approximately 45.4 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on multiple concluding orders (P12-P18 and P22-P25), making the critical planning window (L+1) equal to 5 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 130, In-transit: 130, Total Pipeline: 260) is high relative to the expected demand of ~227 units (45.4 * 5) for the (L+1) window. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 19 periods (recent_N, N=19) to reflect this stabilized lower demand regime accurately. Lead time will remain set to 'calculate' as the historical data is consistent and reliable.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a lower regime since Period 11. The current mean demand (Period 11-30) is approximately 43.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 114, and in-transit inventory is 133, totaling a pipeline of 247 units. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, we must cover demand for the L+1 = 5 period window. The pipeline of 247 units is significantly higher than the expected demand of ~218 units (43.6 * 5) for that window, leading to a surplus. The OR backend needs parameters that reflect this stabilization to avoid excessive holding costs. Forecasts will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime since Period 11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $489.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a consistent mean. Measuring from Period 11 onwards (post-initial high-demand phase), the average demand is approximately 43.2 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the inventory position (On-hand 119 + In-transit 135 = 254) is sufficient to cover the L+1 (5 period) window at the current demand rate (~43.2 * 5 = 216), I will continue using the 'recent_N' method to focus on this stable regime. Specifically, using N=21 (from Period 11 to 31) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a robust estimate for the current demand profile while filtering out the volatile early game data. The backend will use these to maintain a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed through Period 31: Mean demand for Periods 11-31 is 43.2 units (N=21). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 11. Over the last 22 periods (P11-P32), the average demand is approximately 42.1 units per period. The most recent demand (P32) was atypically low at 18 units, but the overall trend remains steady. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages (e.g., P32 showed the P28 order arriving exactly 4 periods later). With a promised lead time (L=4) and the need to cover demand until the next order arrives (L+1), the target pipeline inventory should be based on the stable mean (42.1) and variance from this regime. I will use recent_N with N=22 to capture this stable period (P11-P32), which provides a robust estimate for the OR backend's base-stock calculation while maintaining a lead time value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability further confirmed through Period 32: Mean demand for Periods 11-32 is 42.1 units (N=22). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 11. Analysis of the last 23 periods (Period 11-33) shows a mean demand of approximately 42.0 units per period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Pipeline inventory currently stands at 111 units, which, combined with 128 units on-hand, totals 239 units. Given the lead time L=4, the decision window (L+1) is 5 periods. A mean demand of 42.0 across 5 periods equals 210 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 to capture this stabilized regime (Period 11 to Period 33), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand while minimizing holding costs given the high service level context (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability further confirmed through Period 33: Mean demand for Periods 11-33 is 42.0 units (N=23). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable. For Period 35, the 'on-hand' inventory is 131 and 'in-transit' is 120, totaling 251 units of pipeline inventory. Since Period 11, the average demand has been approximately 42 units per period. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, the (L+1) window covers 5 periods of demand, estimated at 5 * 42 = 210 units. Our current inventory (251) is slightly above this level, but we should maintain consistent ordering to match the observed mean and variance. I will use recent_N (N=24, effectively Periods 11-34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the high-demand noise from the start of the game. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at a lower level since roughly Period 11. For the period range 11-35 (N=25), the mean demand is 41.8 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 31 order arrived in Period 35). Currently, there is 136 units on-hand and 104 units in-transit. Given a lead time of 4, the target window is L+1 = 5 periods. With a mean of ~42, the expected demand over the lead time is 210 units. The pipeline (On-hand 136 + In-transit 104 = 240) is currently sufficient but requires small adjustments to maintain the safety stock buffer calculated by the OR backend. I will use recent_N with N=25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed through Period 35: Mean demand for Periods 11-35 is 41.8 units (N=25). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~42 units per period since Period 11, following a significant drop from the initial high-demand phase (Periods 1-3). In the most recent block (Periods 11-36, N=26), the mean demand is 41.9 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and reliable based on the arrival history (most recently, the P32 order arrived in P36 exactly on time). On-hand inventory is 121 units and in-transit is 106 units, totaling 227 units. Given the stable demand, I am using a recent_N approach for all parameters with N=26 to capture the current regime's statistics while excluding the early high-demand outliers. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the L+1 (5 period) window with appropriate safety stock for the observed volatility in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1105.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a lower level since Period 11. Over the last 27 periods (P11-P37), the average demand is approximately 42.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P37) was 62, which is higher than the recent average, but still within the expected variance. On-hand inventory is 73 and in-transit is 135 (total 208). With a lead time of 4 periods, the next arrival is the 38-unit order from P34, followed by the 23-unit order from P35. To maintain service levels while accounting for the recent higher demand sample and the stable long-term trend, I am using a recent window (N=27) for demand mean and standard deviation. The lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed through Period 37: Mean demand for Periods 11-37 is 42.5 units (N=27). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the lower regime since Period 11, with recent periods (P31-P38) showing some minor fluctuations but maintaining a consistent average. The mean demand for Periods 11-38 (N=28) is approximately 41.5 units per period. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 100 units, and there are 163 units in-transit. Given the OR backend's inventory balancing (calculating base stock for L+1 periods), providing parameters based on the stable regime length (N=28) is most appropriate. The demand volatility (sigma_hat) will also be calculated over this same stable period to capture the current variance. This approach ensures sufficient inventory to cover the lead time window plus safety stock for the low-variance regime without over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the lower regime identified since Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand for Periods 11-39 is 40.7 units (N=29), continuing the trend observed in previous carry-over insights (~41.8 to 43.6 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on arrival history (e.g., Period 35 order arrived in Period 39). Currently, on-hand inventory is 112 with 149 in-transit units. Given the stable demand, I will continue using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the most recent local variance and mean while filtering out the initial high-demand noise. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 5-period window (L+1) without overstocking, as the holding cost is $1.0 vs $19.0 profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: mean demand for Periods 11-39 is 40.7 units (N=29), consistent with long-term lower regime stabilization.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 11. The mean demand for the most recent period (Periods 11-40) is approximately 40 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 124 units, and in-transit inventory is 118 units, totaling 242 units of pipeline inventory. Given the stable lead time of 4 periods (L+1 = 5), and a mean demand of ~40, the calculated base stock (roughly 40 * 5 = 200) is already covered by the existing 242 units in the pipeline. This explains why the order quantity in Period 40 was 0. For Period 41, I will continue to use recent_N to capture this stabilized regime (N=30). I will use the default lead time of 4, as it has been consistent throughout the history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 11. Over the last 30 periods (P11-P41), the mean demand is approximately 40.0 units per period. The most recent demand (P38-P41) has been even lower (11, 11, 19, 21), however, to avoid under-stocking, I will use a window of the last 31 samples (N=31) which captures the entire stabilized lower regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed actual lead times (P37 order arrived in P41, lead_time=4). Current on-hand is 146 and in-transit is 99 (Total 245). This pipeline covers about 6 periods of average demand (245/40 \u2248 6.1), which is slightly above the L+1=5 window, justifying the OR backend's inventory management approach. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=31 to reflect this stable low-demand window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability further confirmed through Period 41: Mean demand for Periods 11-41 is 40.1 units (N=31). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a lower regime since approximately Period 11. The mean demand for the most recent 32 periods (P11-P42) is approximately 39.6 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 42). Currently, on-hand inventory is 188 units and in-transit is 51 units (from P39, P41, and P42 orders). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 239 units. Given the stable demand, using a recent_N approach with N=32 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the characteristics of this stable regime. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on (1+L) periods of demand (5 periods), which at ~40 units/period is roughly 200 units. Since on-hand + in-transit (239) exceeds this, the backend will likely place a minimal or zero order to reduce holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed through Period 42: Mean demand for Periods 11-42 is 39.6 units (N=32). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable lower regime since approximately Period 11. The most recent average (Periods 11-43) is approximately 39.7 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by continuous arrivals including the P39 order in P43). Current on-hand inventory is 155 units with 64 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, P42, and P43). Given the target base stock logic (L+1 periods of demand), and with L=4, we need to cover 5 periods. 5 * 39.7 \u2248 198.5 units. Total inventory (on-hand 155 + in-transit 64) is 219, which is slightly above the expected base stock, but ensures high service levels for the $19 profit margin. I will use 'recent_N' with N=33 to capture this stable regime since Period 11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L as lead times have been perfectly consistent at 4.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a much lower regime compared to the start of the simulation. Since Period 11, the average demand has been consistently around 40 units per period. In the most recent block (Periods 35-44), the mean demand is 29.9 units, which is slightly lower than the long-term low-regime average (approx 40), but reflects continued stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). For Period 45, the on-hand inventory is 123 and in-transit is 105, totaling 228 units. With a lead time of 4, our 'at-risk' window is L+1 = 5 periods. Using a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent stabilization while remaining responsive to the current low mean. The backend OR logic will calculate the order based on this lower demand profile, preventing overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability further confirmed through Period 44: Mean demand for Periods 11-44 is 39.4 units (N=34). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 110 units and in-transit is 81 units, totaling 191 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods.

Given the current total inventory (191) is very close to the expected demand, and we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 46 of 50), I am maintaining the current forecast settings to ensure we don't over-order and incur high holding costs, while remaining receptive to the stable demand mean. I will use recent_N with N=35 to capture the entire stable regime since Period 11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within a lower regime that established around Period 11. Over the last 36 periods (P11-P46), the mean demand is approximately 38.6 units, reflecting a significant drop from the early periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the most recent arrivals (P41 order arrived in P45, P42 order arrived in P46). Inventory levels are currently healthy with 117 on-hand and 129 in-transit. To ensure we continue to cover the L+1 (5-period) window while accounting for this stabilized demand, I am using recent_N with N=36 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the high-demand noise from the first 10 periods. The backend will calculate the base stock based on these late-stage statistics, maintaining a high service level given the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 11-46 average demand is 38.6 units (N=36). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $221.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable lower regime since approximately Period 11. For the current decision at Period 48, I am analyzing the demand over the last 37 periods (Periods 11-47), which yields an average of approximately 38 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (48, 49, 50), and considering the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's end. Currently, there are 121 units on-hand and 116 units in-transit. The total inventory (237 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (estimated at ~114 units total). Therefore, the goal is to minimize holding costs by not placing additional orders, while maintaining parameters that reflect the current stable demand regime for the OR engine's internal logic. I will use a recent_N of 37 to capture the full stability of this lower regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable lower-demand regime since Period 11. Analysis of the last 38 periods (P11-P48) shows a mean demand of approximately 38.3 units per period. The most recent data point (Period 48) shows demand at 28 units, consistent with this established regime. Lead time remains very stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 44 order in Period 48. Currently, on-hand inventory is 134 units and in-transit is 90 units (from orders in P46, P47, and P48). Given the game is approaching its conclusion (Period 49 of 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=38 to capture the full stability of the current regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the remaining demand without over-ordering near the end of the simulation, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost optimally for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed through Period 48: Mean demand for Periods 11-48 is 38.3 units (N=38). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $366.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 11. Over the last 39 periods (P11-P49), the average demand is approximately 38 units per period, consistently lower than the initial startup phase. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical arrival data (P41 arrived in P45, P44 arrived in P48). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 109 and in-transit inventory of 116 (total pipeline = 225). Using the stabilized regime (N=39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock for the current (L+1) window, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).
