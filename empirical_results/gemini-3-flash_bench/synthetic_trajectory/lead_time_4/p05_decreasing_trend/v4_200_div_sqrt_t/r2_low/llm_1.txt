Cumulative demand for P1-P4 (already sold 0) has resulted in lost sales, but my goal is to cover future demand. With a 4-period lead time, a decision made now (P4) covers Period 8 demand. At an average of 150/period, the 900 units currently in-transit cover roughly 6 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10).

{
  "rationale": "We are at the final decision period (Period 50). The game ends after this period. Any order placed now will arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time), which is beyond the scope of the simulation. Therefore, the goal is to maximize profit from existing inventory and avoid any unnecessary future costs. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0. However, an order of 30 units placed in Period 46 is scheduled to arrive during Period 50. Since demand resolution happens after arrival resolution, these 30 units will be available to satisfy Period 50 demand. Historical demand is erratic but has averaged approximately 30-40 units recently (P45-P49 average is ~42 units). If demand in Period 50 is >= 30, we will sell all arriving units. If demand is < 30, we will be charged a holding cost on the remainder. Regardless, placing a new order now would only incur lead-time costs or result in inventory arriving after the game has concluded, providing no benefit to the total reward.",
