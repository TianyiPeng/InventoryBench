(b) Initial inventory is 0, and there are no units in transit. (c) Promised lead time is 4 periods. My decision in Period 1 will arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible/usable for Period 6. (d) To avoid stockouts while waiting for the first shipment to arrive, I need to account for demand in Periods 1 through 5. Demand sum P1-P5 is 130+147+128+116+161 = 682 units. (e) However, since the system satisfies demand AFTER the arrival phase, the order placed now (P1) is intended to cover demand starting from Period 5 or 6 depending on the resolution. To ensure a safety buffer and cover the pipeline of 5 periods (L+1), I will target approximately 5 * 140 = 700 units.

My current inventory position consists of 121 units on-hand and 130 units in-transit (from orders in P44 and P45), totaling 251 units. To cover the remaining demand while minimizing holding costs at the end of the simulation, I need to bridge the remaining gap of ~60 units. An order placed today (P46) will arrive in P50 (the final period). I will order 65 units to ensure full demand satisfaction through the end of the sim, accounting for slight variance, as the cost of a stockout ($1.0 profit loss) is equal to one period of holding cost, but late-game excess inventory is penalized by cumulative holding costs.",

Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory on-hand is 73 units, with 195 units in-transit. The in-transit pipeline consists of orders from P44 (65 units), P45 (65 units), and P46 (65 units). These are expected to arrive in P48, P49, and P50 respectively. Given that the game ends at Period 50, any order placed in Period 47 (with a 4-period lead time) would not arrive until Period 51, which is outside the simulation's timeframe. Total inventory currently available or arriving before the end of Period 50 is 73 (on-hand) + 195 (in-transit) = 268 units. With 4 periods remaining (P47-P50) and an expected total demand of ~244 units (61 * 4), the current pipeline is sufficient. Ordering more would only incur additional holding costs or yield no benefit as they arrive after the final period.",

On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory is 195 units, consisting of orders placed in P44 (65), P45 (65), and P46 (65). Given a lead time of 4 periods, the P44 order (65 units) will arrive during Period 48 resolution, the P45 order (65 units) will arrive during Period 49, and the P46 order (65 units) will arrive during Period 50. Total arriving inventory (195) exceeds the expected remaining demand (183). Any order placed now in Period 48 would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is after the game ends. Therefore, ordering more units would only incur unnecessary lead time costs if they were to arrive, or more accurately, since they arrive after P50, they cannot be sold.

  "rationale": "We are in Period 49 of 50. The game is nearing the terminal period. Current inventory status for 'chips(Regular)' shows On-hand: 36 units and In-transit: 130 units. The in-transit units consist of orders from Period 45 (65 units) and Period 46 (65 units). Given the inferred lead time of 4 periods, order P45 is scheduled to arrive during Period 49 resolution (visible in P50 start), and order P46 is scheduled to arrive during Period 50 resolution. Based on the current stable demand regime (~61 units/period), the existing on-hand stock of 36 will likely be depleted in Period 49. However, the arrival of 65 units at the end of Period 49 will provide stock for the final period (Period 50). Another 65 units will arrive at the end of Period 50, but these will be counted as ending inventory and will not be available to satisfy Period 50 demand. Since Period 50 is the final period and any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 53 (long after the game ends), the optimal action is to place no new orders. Any excess inventory at the end of Period 50 results in unnecessary holding costs, and since the pipeline already covers the final period's demand, an order of 0 is the most profitable decision.",
