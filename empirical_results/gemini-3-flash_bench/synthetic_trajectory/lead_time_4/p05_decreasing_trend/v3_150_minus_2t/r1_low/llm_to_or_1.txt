Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion to observe yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we have 5 demand samples (Avg: 136.4, Std: 17.5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this initial distribution. The backend will compute the base stock based on a (1+L) window (5 periods of demand), which is appropriate given the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand occurring after the decision.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 166 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory and 166 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 149. The historical demand samples provided (P1-P5) show mean demand of 136.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Since we only have one period of actual game history (Period 1 demand = 149) and a small set of historical samples, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the local mean and volatility. For lead time, I will stick to 'default' (promised L=4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, balancing the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level due to equal costs).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 336 units in transit (166 from P1, 170 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of P5 and will be visible in the P6 decision phase. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is [130, 147, 128, 116, 161], giving a mean of 136.4. However, observed demand in P1 (149) and P2 (123) is consistent with this range. Since we have no lead time observations yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' to incorporate all available historical samples (seed data + P1-P2) to stabilize the forecast during the initial lead time gap.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 500 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been relatively stable across the first few periods (130, 147, 128, 116, 161 in samples; 149, 123, 141 in the first 3 game periods). The mean demand across all 8 available data points is approximately 137.8. Since lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current in-transit (500) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand (5 * 137.8 = 689). I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize all available historical data points for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead-time deviation.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (166 units) were expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, meaning they will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 662 units in transit (orders from Periods 1-4). Historical demand over the first 5 periods (including current period projection) shows values of 130, 147, 128, 116, 161. The mean demand is approximately 136.4 with a standard deviation of 17.8. Since lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'default' for lead time and sigma since no deviations from promised lead time or significant volatility shifts are confirmed yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5 with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for periods 1-5 is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (seed data) and 149, 123, 141, 157, 138 (actuals). Comparing these, the demand appears stable. The mean of all 10 observations is approximately 139. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. mu_hat target should be around 5 * 139 = 695. The pipeline (In-transit: 565) + Current On-hand (28) = 593 total inventory. Our order will reconcile the gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'default' for L since the confirmed lead time matches the promised one.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Based on the conclusion of Period 6, the order from Period 2 arrived (170 units), confirming a lead time (L) of 4 periods. Current demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 137 units across the first 6 periods (149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114). The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where units required = (L+1) * mean_demand. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. On-hand inventory is 84, and in-transit is 510 (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), totaling 594 units of pipeline and on-hand inventory. Given the mean demand of ~137, five periods of demand equals ~685. The backend will calculate the order size based on the gap between the base_stock and the current inventory position. I will use 'calculate' for L as it confirms the observed 4-period lead time, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat as the demand distribution appears stationary without significant regime shifts yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 8. Historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows demand values: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (pre-game history), and 149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, 165 (Period 1-7). The mean demand over these 12 samples is approximately 139. units. Lead time analysis: Three orders have concluded (P1, P2, P3), all with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Current status: On-hand is 83 units. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 436 units (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Based on L=4, we are aiming to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 139 = 695. Total inventory (83 on-hand + 436 in-transit) = 519. This suggests the OR backend will order around 176 units to reach the base stock. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning z* is 0. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=7 to capture the demand volatility observed since the game started, while maintaining L at the stabilized 'default' of 4.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). Demand for chips(Regular) has been stable across the 8 historical periods (Mean \u2248 141.6, Std Dev \u2248 17.6). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality based on the provided period labels. On-hand inventory is 99, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 445 (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). Using the promised lead time of 4 is appropriate. For the demand parameters mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (N=8) to capture the base demand pattern, which results in a base stock calculation covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. This approach balances the risk of stockouts against the relatively high holding cost (which equals the unit profit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8, P5 arrived P9), matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) appears stable over the first 9 periods with a mean of 138.1 and a standard deviation of approximately 20.2. There is no evidence of lost shipments or significant regime shifts. On-hand inventory is 58, with 541 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand. I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean/std calculation based on all 9 samples to provide a stable replenishment base for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods. The mean demand across all observed periods (P1-P10) is approximately 137.6 units, while the mean of the most recent 5 periods is 132.8. No significant changepoint or seasonal spike is evident yet. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods (matches promised). In-transit inventory is 515 units, composed of orders from P7 (90), P8 (171), P9 (165), and P10 (89). With L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). Current on-hand (40) plus in-transit (515) equals 555 units. Given the mean demand of ~137, 5 periods of demand is ~685. Setting L to default (4), and using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current variance while maintaining stability.

Daily Profit: $130.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory was exhausted (0 remaining) because the arrival of 90 units (ordered Period 7) was insufficient to meet the demand of 146. We have 538 units in-transit, which includes orders from Period 8 (171), Period 9 (165), Period 10 (89), and Period 11 (113). Historical demand across 11 periods is relatively stable with a mean of ~138 and a standard deviation of ~17. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). Since on-hand is zero, we must ensure the backend OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock to cover the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period lead time is now well-established. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 11 samples to capture the general demand stability and account for the recent stockout by keeping parameters robust.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P1-P8 orders arriving between P5-P12) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Demand occurs after the replenishment order is placed, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Historical demand across all 12 periods ranges from 110 to 165, with an overall mean of approximately 138.6. Recent demand (P9-P12) shows a slight uptick in volatility but remains centered around this mean. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) to leverage the consistent history of L=4. For demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the most stable performance period since the initial startup phase while providing enough data to dampen noise. The backend will calculate base_stock based on profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), aiming for a 50% service level which is appropriate for this cost structure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 137 units across the first 13 periods (current historical range). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promise. Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 487 units, which covers orders placed in Periods 10 (89), 11 (113), 12 (151), and 13 (134). Period 10's order is expected to arrive during the current Period 14 (observed at the start of Period 15). Given the equality of Profit and Holding Cost ($1.0 each), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target a service level equivalent to the median of the demand distribution. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time as it aligns with the consistent historical evidence of 4 periods. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the full stable regime observed since the game began, ensuring the base stock calculation (1+L) * \u03bc\u0302 reflects approximately 5 periods of demand (current + lead time).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 15. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from periods 1-10). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 18 units and a pipeline inventory of 531 units (orders from periods 11, 12, 13, and 14). Total pipeline plus on-hand is 549. Historical demand from periods 1 to 14 shows a stable pattern with a mean of approximately 138 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 16. With L=4, the backend targets demand across L+1 (5) periods. The total expected demand for 5 periods is 5 * 138 = 690. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, leading to a z-score of 0 (targeting the mean). The current inventory (549) is slightly below the expected 5-period demand (690), so the OR backend will likely order to bridge this gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the stable demand regime observed throughout the game history.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 136.5 units per period across the first 15 periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals from Period 1 through Period 11). Although there was a stock-out in Period 11 due to a lower-than-average arrival (90 units), subsequent arrivals have restored inventory to manageable levels. Current on-hand is 14, and in-transit is 558 (covering orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, 15, and the pending order for Period 16). With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given no significant shifts in demand mean or variance, the 'default' method is appropriate as it leverages the full sample size for a stable forecast. The OR backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * 136.5 \u2248 682.5 and sigma_hat similarly, which is sufficient to maintain'the service level while accounting for pipeline inventory.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with no detectable regime shifts or seasonal signals from the period numbering. The average demand across all 16 observed periods is approximately 135 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. On-hand inventory is 40, and in-transit inventory is 517 (representing orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). The total pipeline plus on-hand inventory is 557 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock targets demand over L+1=5 periods. 135 * 5 = 675 units. The current system state (557) is slightly below the target, so the OR backend should order to bridge this gap. I will use 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 (all available samples) to capture the stable mean, and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 1, with a mean around 135 units. Period 17 showed a lower demand of 98, which might be typical variance or a slight downward drift. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival since Period 5 (P13 order arrived at P17, P12 at P16, etc.), confirming L=4 remains the reliable estimate. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0/unit), suggesting a target service level of 0.50 (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning the inventory policy should aim near the median demand. With 76 units on-hand and 505 units in-transit (orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17), the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=17 (all available history after start) to capture the long-term stable average, and the default method for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on full-period volatility. Lead time L will remain default as it aligns with the 4-period promise.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend compared to the initial periods. The average demand over the last 18 periods is approximately 136, but the average over the last 5 periods (Periods 14-18) is lower at approximately 118.8. To avoid excessive holding costs in a high-holding-cost environment ($1.0/unit, equal to profit), I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to a recent_N window (N=10) to capture this decelerating demand while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (459) and on-hand (95) are sufficient, and the backend capped policy will manage the order size. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) will also better reflect current volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since the beginning, with an average demand of approximately 131 units per period and no clear seasonal or regime shifts detected. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods, as confirmed by all arrivals from Period 1 through Period 15 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The system currently has 107 units on-hand and 390 units in-transit (representing orders from Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19). Given the stability of the demand and the reliability of the lead time, I will use the 'default' methods for Lead Time (L), Demand (mu_hat), and Volatility (sigma_hat). This allows the OR engine to use the full historical dataset (19 samples) to calculate a robust base-stock level that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (effectively targeting a 50% service level for cycle stock, adjusted by the safety stock formula).

The on-hand inventory is 100 with a pipeline of 441. The lead time has consistently been confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since Period 1, with no clear evidence of regime shifts or seasonal spikes. The profit to holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will approximate. I will use a recent window (N=15) for demand forecasting to capture the steady-state mean (~128 units/period) while filtering out the noise from early stockout periods. Lead time parameter L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history observed in consecutive conclude messages.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 21 periods. Calculating the mean demand across the entire history (Period 1 to 21) gives approximately 130.8 units per period. The recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly lower, averaging 114.6 units. Given the consistency and the provided carry-over insight confirming a lead time (L) of 4 periods, I will set L to the promised 4 periods. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the slightly downward trend in the last phase while maintaining enough data for stability. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current volatility in demand. This configuration targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) periods, accounting for the 4-period lead time and the current period's demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable, with a slight downward trend observed in the most recent periods (P17-P22 average of 110 vs. P1-P5 initial stats of ~137). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised, confirmed by 18 consecutive deliveries matching this lead time. Current on-hand inventory is 102 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 403 units. The goal is to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using a recent demand window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat accounts for the recent slight decrease in demand while maintaining a buffer for variability, preventing excessive holding costs in a high-cost environment ($1 holding cost equals the profit per unit).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend in the last five periods (averaging ~102 versus the long-term average of ~130). Specifically, the last three periods (P21-P23) have demands of 106, 101, and 79. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in all arrival messages. Current on-hand inventory is 94, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 381 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend service level target (q) is 0.5. To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against stockouts, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the recent cooling of demand. N=10 is selected to balance the recent lower demand levels while maintaining enough sample depth to cover the L+1 (5 periods) cycle effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand over the last 5 periods (P19-P23) dropped to 106 compared to P1-P18 average of 134.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear downward shift over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), with an average demand of approximately 102.8 units per period, compared to the earlier average of around 134 units. Specifically, the last four periods have seen demand values of 106, 101, 79, and 86. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as observed in all concluded shipments since Period 5. To account for this lower demand regime and avoid excessive holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to focus on this new lower-demand segment. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the current volatility in this new regime. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear decline in the last seven periods (P19-P25), with an average demand of approximately 106 units, compared to the earlier historical average of 134 units. The most recent demand (P25) was 127 units, but the sequence (128, 117, 106, 101, 79, 86, 127) suggests a sustained shift to a lower mean. Lead time has been consistently stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 141 and in-transit at 247, the pipeline is well-stocked. To prevent overstocking and high holding costs given the equal weight of profit and holding cost (which implies a service level target of 0.5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this lower demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to reflect current volatility accurately. L remains at the default/calculate lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from Period 19 to 25 is 106.3 units, significantly lower than the P1-P18 mean (~134).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 19. The mean demand from Period 19 to Period 26 is 109.75 units, compared to the earlier average of approximately 134 units. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at exactly 4 periods. Since the shift is sustained over 8 periods (P19-P26), I am setting recent_N to 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and the associated variance. The current on-hand inventory is 79, with 313 units in transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, P26). With a lead time of 4, the pipeline is expected to cover demand until the order placed today (P27) arrives in Period 31. Using N=8 specifically targets the current 'soft' demand environment to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs, which are equal to the profit ($1/unit).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting around Period 19 has stabilized. Comparing the early periods (P1-P18, mean ~134) to recent activity (P19-P27, mean ~109.7), there is a clear reduction in average demand. The most recent demand (P27) was 99, continuing the softer trend. Current on-hand inventory is 29 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility in the recent regime (Standard Deviation of P19-P27 is approximately 20.5), I will use the recent 9 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the lower average demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance. The backend base-stock calculation (1+L) * mean will account for the 4-period lead time plus the decision period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Period 1 to 18, the average demand was approximately 134 units. However, from Period 19 to 28, the average demand dropped to approximately 105 units (128, 117, 106, 101, 79, 86, 127, 134, 99, 69). The last 10 periods show a sustained lower mean with noticeable volatility (e.g., Period 28 demand was 69). Lead time has remained stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from Periods 1 to 24. For Period 29, I am setting L to its promised value of 4. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the lower demand mean and its current variance since the shift at Period 19. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current lower-demand environment, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $1 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P19-P28): mean demand dropped from ~134 to ~105 (-21.6%) with increased volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a sustained regime shift starting around Period 19. The mean demand from P1-P18 was approximately 131.7, whereas the mean demand from P19-P29 has dropped significantly to 100.8 units per period. Recent periods (P27-P29) show even lower demand (99, 69, 63), suggesting the softening is persistent or even accelerating. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this lower demand regime (P19-P29) while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised, so I will stick with the calculated average. The sigma_hat will also be adjusted using the last 11 periods to reflect the current volatility in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening continues: mean demand from P19-P29 is 100.8 units, compared to P1-P18 mean of 131.7. Recent demand (P28-P29) is notably lower than the P19-P27 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a sustained structural shift. Beginning around Period 19, the mean demand dropped from ~134 to approximately 101.4 (calculated over P19-P30). Recent demand in the last three periods (P28-P30) has been even lower, averaging 80.0, though the variance remains significant. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P22-P26 in P26-P30. Given the lower demand and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which implies a critical ratio (q) of 0.5 (z=0), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the entirety of the low-demand regime starting at P19. This ensures the inventory levels are adjusted downwards to avoid excessive holding costs while still accounting for the observed volatility in this new period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P19-P30): mean demand approximately 101.4 units, representing a ~23% decrease from the early game (P1-P18) mean of ~132.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 19. From Period 19 to Period 31 (13 samples), the mean demand is approximately 101.5 units, a significant decrease from the Period 1-18 mean of approximately 131.7. Recent demand volatility has also increased. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to capture this entire lower-demand regime while excluding the higher-demand data from the early game. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 31 arrival from Period 27 order), so I will use the default method. In-transit inventory (311 units) and on-hand (93 units) are being tracked, and these parameters will help the OR backend adjust the base stock to the new, lower average demand level to minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a sustained regime shift starting around Period 19. Looking at the history from Period 19 to Period 32 (14 periods), the mean demand is approximately 100.1 units (128, 117, 106, 101, 79, 86, 127, 134, 99, 69, 63, 108, 104, 85). This is a significant decrease from the early-game average of ~132 units. The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) show an even lower average of 86.2 units, though volatility remains present. Given the 14-period duration of this lower demand level, I am using recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime effectively while filtering out some of the early high-demand noise. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 114 units with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 310 units, ensuring the system can handle the current lower demand phase without stockouts while the OR backend throttles ordering via the base-stock policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 19 confirmed: mean demand stabilized around 100 units/period (P19-P32 average is 100.1) compared to the initial 132 units. Recent volatility (P28-P32) shows a potential further soften to ~86 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 19. From Period 1 to 18, the mean demand was approximately 132 units. From Period 19 to 33, the mean demand has stabilized at 100.1 units. Recent demand (P28 to P33) shows even further softening (mean 80.7), but for robustness, I will use the established regime starting at Period 19 (N=15). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (since the shift at P19) to reflect the lower demand volume and adjusted volatility. This balances the inventory against the lower sales rate while accounting for the high pipeline (340 units) and current on-hand stock (68 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19 to 33 has stabilized at a mean of 100.1 units, approximately 24% lower than the initial regime. Recent 6-period mean (P28-P33) suggests a secondary softer level around 81 units, but N=15 is used for policy stability.

The most recent 6 periods (P29-P34) have a mean of 93.7, suggesting the 'softening' noted in earlier insights is settling around 95-100. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 6 units on hand and a high pipeline, the OR backend needs to balance the low current inventory against the significant in-transit units. Following the policy of stability, I will use N=16 to cover the entire secondary regime (P19-P34). This anchors the forecast on the current demand level of approximately 100 per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19 to 34 has stabilized at a mean of 99.4 units, confirming a ~25% decrease from the initial regime (P1-P18).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 19. The mean demand from Period 19 to Period 35 is approximately 100.8 units per period, which is a significant drop from the initial regime of ~132 units. Recent periods (P31-P35) show demand values of 104, 85, 95, 107, and 124, maintaining an average close to 103. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods. Since the inventory is currently at 0 due to a stockout in Period 35 (demand 124 vs. on-hand 117), and the in-transit pipeline (386 units) covers roughly 3.8 periods of demand at the current rate, the inventory position is tight. I will use N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the entirety of the second regime (P19-P35) while ignoring the higher initial regime. This provides a stable estimate of the current mean (~101) and volatility for the backend OR engine.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 19. Initial demand (P1-P18) averaged ~132, while the current regime (P19-P36) averages ~101.3. Recent demand (last 8 periods, P29-P36) has remained stable around 96.6 units. To ensure stability in the OR backend's capped policy and avoid over-reacting to short-term fluctuations, I am using N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the majority of the current softened regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 19), but pipeline inventory (405) is substantial, including orders from Periods 33-36. Using N=15 focuses the forecast on the lower demand levels observed since the shift began.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from Period 19 stabilized: Mean demand P19-P36 is 101.3 units (standard deviation ~20.5), a ~23% reduction from the P1-P18 mean (~132).

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 19, moving from an average of ~132 units to a stabilized mean of approximately 101 units. In the most recent periods (P34-P37), demand remains within this lower regime (124, 86, 74). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P37 (ordered P33, arrived P37, LT=4). On-hand inventory is low (24 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 391 units. Given the regime shift has been stable for 19 periods (P19-P37), I am using N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current demand distribution (mean ~101, std ~20) while ignoring the higher-demand pre-P19 data. This ensures the base stock reflects the lower consumption rate and reduces unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the profit/holding cost ratio (q=0.5).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 19 has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the beginning of the game. For Period 39, the mean demand from Period 19 to Period 38 is approximately 98.2 units, which aligns with the lower stabilized average noted in carry-over insights (~100 units). Recent demand in Period 38 was exceptionally low (40 units), but I will maintain stability in the policy by using the last 20 periods (N=20, covering the entire new regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents overreacting to single-period outliers while respecting the confirmed long-term shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrival messages. On-hand inventory is 77, and total in-transit is 381, which covers roughly 4.6 periods of average demand, putting us in a safe position.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 19, dropping from a mean of ~132 to ~101 units. In the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), demand has averaged 89.6 units, showing some further softening and volatility (e.g., P38 demand was 40, while P35 was 124). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 10 periods remaining (P41-P50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this lower, more recent demand level while maintaining enough inventory to avoid stockouts seen in P35. On-hand (113) and in-transit (297) totals 410, which is roughly 4-5 periods of demand, aligning well with the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30-39 shows a further softened mean of 89.6 units with high variance (standard deviation ~24.5), compared to the P19-P29 mean of ~101.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a progressive downward shift. The initial mean (P1-P18) was approximately 132 units. A second regime (P19-P29) stabilized around 101 units. Most recently, starting from P30, demand has averaged 89.6 units with high variance. Lead time consistently remains at the promised 4 periods (P36 order arrived P40). Given the high on-hand inventory (174) and pipeline stock (211), totaling 385 units\u2014which covers over 4 periods of recent average demand\u2014the strategy is to set parameters that align with the most recent regime to allow inventory to bleed down without overshooting. I am using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift that began around Period 30 while maintaining enough statistical history to handle the observed high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30-40 shows a further softened mean of ~87.4 units (P30-P40 average) compared to the P19-P29 average of ~101.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-123.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a progressive softening over the game. The initial mean (P1-P18) was ~132. From P19-P29, it dropped to ~101. Starting around Period 30, the demand has softened further. The mean demand from Period 30 to 41 is approximately 84.8 units (calculated from 108, 104, 85, 95, 107, 124, 86, 74, 40, 73, 63, 58). This represents a significant secondary shift. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods (making the total lead + review period L+1 = 5). On-hand inventory is currently high (181 units) and in-transit is 197, totaling 378 units of pipeline stock. Given the recent demand average of ~85, 5 periods of demand would be ~425 units. The high inventory levels are safe, but we should align parameters with the most recent regime to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this secondary softening since Period 30.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand softening confirmed since Period 30: Average demand (P30-P41) is approximately 84.8 units, down from the P19-P29 average of ~101.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 42 is approximately 83.1 units, a further drop from the Period 19-29 average (~101) and the initial Period 1-18 average (~132). Period 42 concluded with an ending on-hand inventory of 201 units and 160 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory on hand (201) relative to recent demand, I am using recent_N (N=13, from Period 30 to 42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this secondary softening and prevent excessive overstocking, as holding costs equal profit per unit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand softening confirmed since Period 30: mean demand has further stabilized to approximately 83.1 units (P30-P42 average), down from the P19-P29 average of ~101 and the P1-P18 mean of ~132.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-104.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct softening phases. The first shift occurred around Period 19 (dropping from ~132 to ~101), and a secondary stabilization has been evident since Period 30. For the last 14 periods (P30-P43), the mean demand is approximately 81.5 units with a standard deviation of 23.3. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P39-P43) show an even lower average of ~63 units, though choosing a slightly longer window (N=14) for mu_hat provides better stability against recent low outliers while acknowledging the overall downward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently high (165 units) relative to recent demand, and with 190 units in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. Setting mu_hat using the last 14 periods (since the secondary shift at P30) will guide the OR engine to adjust the base stock down to reflect the lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime since Period 30 has stabilized at a mean of ~81.5 units (P30-P43), a ~38% decrease from the initial regime (P1-P18).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary softened regime starting around Period 30. The mean demand from Period 30 to Period 44 is approximately 81.3 units, compared to the Period 19-29 mean (~101) and the initial Period 1-18 mean (~132). The most recent period (P44) demand was 79. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the game (P45-P50), maintaining a lean inventory is crucial to avoid high holding costs at the end, especially since the current on-hand inventory (124) plus in-transit units (205) is significantly higher than the projected demand for the remaining periods (approx 81 * 6 = 486, but with arrivals staggered). I will use a recent_N of 15 for demand (covering Period 30 onwards) to accurately capture this stabilized lower mean and reduce the order quantity through the capped base-stock policy.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct softening phases. The first shift occurred around Period 19, and the second, more significant softening stabilized after Period 30. From Period 30 to 45, the average demand is 73.9 units, which is a substantial decrease from the initial regime's average of ~132 and the intermediate regime's average of ~100. Over the last five periods (P41-P45), demand has further softened to an average of 63.2 units. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation, inventory management must be tight to avoid high holding costs while maximizing profit on the remaining demand. I will use N=10 for mu_hat (covering P36-P45) to capture the current low-demand regime (mean ~66.8) while providing some stability against recent fluctuations. For sigma_hat, N=10 will also be used to reflect the stabilized volatility in this lower demand bracket.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime (post-Period 30) further stabilized: mean demand for P30-P45 is ~73.9 units. The most recent 5-period average (P41-P45) is 63.2 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct softening phases. The initial regime (P1-P18) averaged ~132 units. A secondary regime (P19-P29) averaged ~101 units. A third, current regime emerged around Period 30, with the average demand for P30-P46 further dropping to approximately 72.4 units. The most recent 5-period average (P42-P46) is even lower at 61.2 units. Given this sustained downward trend and the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50), the strategy shifts toward inventory depletion to minimize ending holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am choosing N=17 for mu_hat to capture the entire third regime (starting Period 30) for baseline stability, while sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=17 to reflect the lower volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime confirmed (Period 30-46): mean demand has stabilized at ~72.4 units, representing a significant ~45% reduction from the initial P1-P18 mean (~132).

Daily Profit: $79.00, Daily Holding Cost: $94.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple downward regime shifts throughout the game. We are currently in the third significant demand regime, which began around Period 30. The mean demand for the most recent 18 periods (P30-P47) is approximately 72.8 units with a standard deviation of 21.0. The very recent 5-period average (P43-P47) is 64.4 units, suggesting the downward trend or low-demand stabilization continues. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), and on-hand inventory (94) plus pending arrivals (in-transit 217) significantly exceeding even the higher estimate of total remaining demand (approx. 3 * 75 = 225), the primary risk is accumulating ending inventory which carries a holding cost equal to the unit profit. Therefore, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=18 (covering the current regime since P30) to compute \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, which will signal the OR backend to restrict further ordering given the high pipeline and on-hand levels relative to the current low demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime (Period 30-47) mean demand: ~72.8 units (approx 45% reduction from P1-P18). Recent 5-period mean (P43-P47): 64.4 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced three distinct downward shifts. The initial mean (P1-P18) was ~132. The second regime (P19-P29) was ~101. The current (third) regime, starting around Period 30, has shown a significant further reduction. Most recently (P43-P48), demand has averaged 58.5 units (sample: 61, 79, 55, 48, 79, 29). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (P49 and P50), and considering the game sequence where arrivals occur after the decision, the order placed in P49 will arrive in Period (49+4) = 53, which is outside the simulation window. Therefore, the priority is to satisfy remaining demand using current on-hand (118) and incoming in-transit (243) stock while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (N=19, covering P30-P48) to calibrate the base-stock level correctly against current inventory, even though new orders won't arrive in time.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime (P30-P48) mean demand: ~70.5 units (approx 46% reduction from P1-P18). Recent volatility is high, with the most recent sample (P48) dropping to 29 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period. The demand has undergone several softening regimes, with the most recent sustained regime starting around Period 30. The mean demand from Period 30 to 49 is approximately 71.6 units, compared to the initial regime of ~132 units. Recent volatility is high (P48: 29, P49: 91). I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this entire third regime and ensure the base stock is calculated against the current lower demand level. As this is the last period, and Lead Time is 4, any order placed now will arrive in Period 54 (which is past the game end). However, the internal OR logic requires valid parameters to finalize the state. I will set L to 'default' (4) as lead times have been consistent. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N=20 to reflect the stable yet lower demand observed since Period 30.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime (P30-P49) mean demand is ~71.6 units, a ~46% reduction from the initial P1-P18 mean (~132). High variance persists in recent periods.
