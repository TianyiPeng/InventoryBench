Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we have no historical arrivals yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as the base for calculations. The objective is to establish an initial order to cover demand across the replenishment cycle (L+1 = 5 periods). Based on the 5 historical demand samples provided (130, 147, 128, 116, 161), the mean demand is 136.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.1. Because there are no visible trends or seasonal markers yet, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture all available historical data points for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This results in a mu_hat covering 5 periods of demand and a sigma_hat scaled by sqrt(5).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 166 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4 periods. As expected for a multi-period lead time, nothing arrived in Period 1 (confirmed by the Period 1 conclude message showing arrived=0). On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning the demand of 149 in Period 1 was lost. Demand history shows values ranging from 116 to 161 across the provided historical samples and Period 1. The mean of the 6 available samples (130, 147, 128, 116, 161, 149) is 138.5. Since we are early in the simulation and no lead-time variance or demand regime shifts have been confirmed yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data. This ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock based on the promised lead time (L=4) and the full demand profile to cover the (L+1)=5 period risk horizon.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been [130, 147, 128, 116, 161] (based on provided samples) and recent results for P1 and P2 are 149 and 123 respectively. The average demand across these 7 data points is approximately 136.4. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in P1 with L=4 will arrive during P5 and be visible in P6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 332 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since on-hand is 0, we have experienced stockouts in P1 and P2 (sold 0), which is expected as no inventory has arrived yet. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), the backend needs to target a base stock level that accounts for these 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent variability, and 'default' for lead time and sigma.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (166, 166, 167 units respectively) are still in transit and are expected to arrive starting in Period 5 (L=4 means order at P1 arrives during P1+4=P5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as the demand in Periods 1-3 (149, 123, 141) could not be met. Total in-transit is 499. The historical demand samples provided (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) show a relatively stable mean around 136.4. Since the on-hand inventory is empty and shipments haven't arrived yet, I will use all available historical demand samples (N=5) to estimate demand and volatility for the coverage period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will stick to the promised lead time of 4 until arrival data suggests otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first four periods shows a mean of approximately 142.5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, we should see the arrival confirmed in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have concluded their lead time yet. The pipeline (in-transit) contains 668 units (orders from P1-P4). Given that the demand appears stable around 130-160 units per period, I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which calculates statistics based on all available samples (P1-P5). For lead time, I will remain at the promised 'default' of 4, as we have not yet seen any completed arrivals to suggest a deviation from the promised lead time.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Using the formula L+1 for coverage, we need to account for 5 periods of demand. Current historical demand mean is approx 136.6 units (P1-P5 samples: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 - wait, the historical demand section says 130, 147, 128, 116, 161, but the game history shows slightly different values: 149, 123, 141, 157, 138. I will prioritize the 'Game History' data for Mu calculation as it represents the specific instance results). Mean demand from history (149+123+141+157+138)/5 = 141.6. Mu_hat (L+1) = 5 * 141.6 = 708. Standard deviation is approximately 13.5. Sigma_hat (sqrt(L+1)) = sqrt(5) * 13.5 \u2248 30.2. In-transit is currently 560 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), and on-hand is 28. Total pipeline = 588. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4, I will use 'default' for L and 'default' for mu/sigma to capture all 5 samples, which is within the N=20 range.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the 'promised' lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed across two deliveries (P1 and P2 orders both arrived in 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 80, with a significant pipeline of 529 units. Demand has been relatively stable across the first 6 periods (avg ~137). I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture recent levels while smoothing out noise. Since lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods, I will stick with the default L. The backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand, ensuring we maintain a service level consistent with a 80% critical ratio ($4 profit / ($4 profit + $1 holding)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $578.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P3 order arrived in P7). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 140 units across the 7 observed periods (149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, 165). On-hand inventory is 82, and in-transit inventory is 458 (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). The OR backend calculates base stock to cover (L+1) periods. Since lead time L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using all available historical samples (N=7) is appropriate as there is no evidence of a demand regime shift. I will set L to 'default' (promised 4) and use the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the global average and standard deviation calculated by the backend.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of historical arrivals (Periods 5-8) confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable over the first 8 periods, ranging between 114 and 165 units, with an average of approximately 141.6 units per period. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 457 units, and current on-hand is 105. Since the lead time is confirmed and there is no evidence of regime shifts or seasonal spikes yet, I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to utilize all available historical data points (N=8) for a robust inventory policy. This approach balances the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding over-ordering based on short-term noise.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-9). Demand has been relatively stable, with samples: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (from context) and 149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, 165, 146, 110 (from history). The mean demand over all 14 samples is approximately 137.5 units per period. With L=4, the pipeline should cover L+1=5 periods of demand (approx 687.5 units). Currently, On-hand (53) + In-transit (566) = 619 units. The backend will calculate the order based on mu_hat and sigma_hat. Given the stability of the demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most relevant recent mean and standard deviation, which should keep service levels high while managing holding costs. L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical demand for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to 10 shows a mean of approximately 137.6 units (149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, 165, 146, 110, 133). The standard deviation is roughly 17.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-6. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory position (On-hand 55 + In-transit 551 = 606) against an expected 5-period demand of ~688 indicates we are under-stocked relative to a high service level goal (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full history since the demand appears stable, and 'calculate' for Lead Time since it matches the promised 4 periods consistently.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by orders from Periods 1 through 7 all arriving exactly 4 periods after ordering. The current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) after Period 11's demand was met. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 571 units. Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable across the history (Periods 1-11), with a mean of approximately 138 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 18.0. Since there are no detected shifts in demand regime or lead time, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the full history since the game start. This provides a balance between the promised lead time and the consistent actual lead time observations. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 5-12) confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (arrived in P+4, visible in P+5). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with no visible regime shifts or calendar-based seasonality observed in the first 12 periods. The mean demand across all historical samples (12 periods) is approximately 138.5. Using L=4, the review cycle plus lead time (L+1) is 5 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'default' method, which utilizes all available samples to compute the mean and standard deviation over 5 periods, as there is currently no evidence of a structural break or sustained shift in demand patterns.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 137 units per period and a standard deviation of about 16 units over the last 13 periods. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all concluded shipments since Period 5. Currently, there are 73 units on-hand and 520 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13). Since the lead time is L=4, my parameters must cover demand for the next L+1 = 5 periods. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to ensure the OR backend captures the current stable regime. N=13 covers all data post-initialization.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained exceptionally stable over the first 14 periods, with no observable regime shifts or seasonal spikes. The mean demand across all observed periods is approximately 137.7 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (promised = actual). At the start of Period 15, we have 53 units on-hand and 526 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory covers orders placed in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14 (116, 149, 135, and 126 units respectively), which sums to 526, matching the reported in-transit figure. This confirms no shipments have been lost. Given the high stability, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (all available post-start periods) to capture the current steady-state demand distribution effectively, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time is reliably 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable pattern with a mean of approximately 136 units (Periods 1-15). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all concluded orders (Periods 5-15). The current on-hand inventory is 52 units, and there are 549 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15). Specifically, the P12 order of 149 units is expected to arrive during the current period (P16). Since the demand regime has been stable throughout the history, I will use all available historical samples (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using 'recent_N' with N=15 for a history of 15 periods is equivalent to using the full history but ensures focus on the observed game data rather than the pre-game seed samples if they were to differ. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead time has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 17. Looking at the history (Periods 1-16) and initial samples, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in the carry-over insight from Period 6 and validated by every arrival through Period 16). Demand has remained relatively stable, with no significant structural shifts detected in the last several periods. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-16) is approximately 136.25 units per period. In the last 5 periods (Periods 12-16), demand was 140, 127, 140, 117, and 125, averaging 129.8 units. Given this stability, I will use a larger sample window (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full history of this stable regime. The base stock calculation requires covering demand for L+1 periods (4+1=5). Total pipeline inventory is 511 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, P16) and on-hand is 76. No shipments are currently overdue or lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 134 units over the first 17 periods. Period 17 saw a slightly lower demand of 98, but not enough to signal a regime shift. Lead time has consistently stayed at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5 through 17). Currently, there are 113 units on-hand and 497 units in-transit (orders from periods 14, 15, 16, and 17). The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With demand mean around 134 and a standard deviation around 17 (calculated from historical samples), a base stock of approximately 750-800 is required to maintain a high service level. The current pipeline (113 + 497 = 610) is slightly below the required coverage, so the backend will place an order to bridge this gap. I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=17 for demand parameters to capture the full stable history since the start of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward shift recently. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 11-18), the average historical demand is approximately 122 units per period, compared to the earlier average (Periods 1-10) of approximately 134 units. This shift justifies using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this lower volume and prevent overstocking. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all 14 completed delivery cycles (Periods 5-18). Forecasted demand across the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) is approximately 610 units. With 125 units on-hand and 462 units in-transit (total pipeline of 587), the OR backend will order approximately 23 units, maintaining a lean inventory while respecting the lead time lag. I am using recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to align with the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 11: average demand decreased from 134 to 122 units (-9%) through Period 18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 11. Over Periods 11-19, the average demand is approximately 126 units (146, 140, 127, 140, 117, 125, 98, 114, 128), which is notably lower than the early period average (~140). The current on-hand inventory is healthy (136 units) and there is a significant pipeline in-transit (396 units), approximately matching the expected demand across the lead time. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history. To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs while the demand is in this lower regime, I am using recent_N (N=9, covering Period 11 to 19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current lower mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 130, and there are 412 units in transit, which aligns with orders placed in Periods 17, 18, 19, and 20 (121 + 91 + 73 + 127 = 412). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. A demand regime shift was previously identified starting at Period 11, where mean demand dropped by approximately 9% to 122 units. Since Period 11, the observed demand values are: 146, 140, 127, 140, 117, 125, 98, 114, 128, 117. Calculating the mean for these last 10 samples (N=10) yields 125.2 units per period. I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime while maintaining sufficient sample size to capture volatility. L will remain at calculate as the lead time of 4 is stable and matches the promised lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 122 units compared to the early period average of 144 units. The most recent observations (Periods 19-21) confirm this trend with demands of 128, 117, and 106. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 145 and a significant pipeline of 403 units (orders from P18, P19, P20, P21), the inventory position is healthy. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (tracking the regime shift from Period 11 to Period 21) to capture this lower mean while maintaining enough safety stock for the lead time (L=4, so L+1=5 periods of coverage).

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained decrease. From Period 1 to 10, the average demand was approximately 139.6 units. Since Period 11, the demand has shifted lower, with an average of 122 units from Periods 11 to 22. In the last 5 periods (Period 18 to 22), demand has been even lower, averaging 111.2 units (114, 128, 117, 106, 101). Given this downward trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=12 (representing the regime since Period 11) to capture the lower baseline while ensuring sufficient inventory for lead-time variability. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods as promised, and arrivals are regular. The current inventory (On-hand: 135, In-transit: 410) is healthy relative to the lowering demand, but we must continue to order to maintain the pipeline for the 5-period cycle (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: recent 5-period average demand dropped further to 111 units from previous regime average shift of 122.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a clear downward shift. From Period 11 to 17, average demand was approximately 122 units. Starting from Period 18, demand has dropped further, with the last 6 periods averaging 107.5 units and the most recent demand (Period 23) being just 79 units. Given this sustained regime shift, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=6) to capture the current lower demand trend (approx 108 units/period). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals. The inventory position (On-hand: 129 + In-transit: 430 = 559) is quite high relative to a 5-period window (L+1) at the new demand level (approx 540 expected demand), so the OR backend will likely reduce order quantities to prevent excessive holding costs. Sigma_hat is also adjusted to recent variability to ensure the service level is maintained without overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: Average demand decreased from 122 to 108 units (-11.5%) over the last 6 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a progressive downward trend. We identified a regime shift starting at Period 11 (averaging 122 units) and another shift starting at Period 18. Between Period 18 and Period 24, the average demand has dropped further to approximately 104 units (114, 128, 117, 106, 101, 79, 86). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (170) and significant in-transit (314), we need to set parameters that reflect the current lower demand level to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use the last 7 periods (from the P18 changepoint) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend adjusts the base stock to the new lower-demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 refined: Recent 7-period average demand is approximately 104 units, a significant decrease from the Period 1-10 average of 137.

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of downward shifts. Starting from an initial average of ~137 (P1-10), it dropped to ~122 (P11-17), and has further declined since Period 18. Over the last 8 periods (P18-P25), the average demand is approximately 101.5 units (114, 128, 117, 106, 101, 79, 86, 127). The most recent 3 periods show higher volatility but a low mean (avg 97.3). I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=8 to capture this lower volume regime while maintaining responsiveness to the high variance. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy (155), and the pipeline (273) plus existing stock is sufficient for the L+1 window (~500 units), so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering naturally.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: Average demand has stabilized around 101 units (P18-P25), down from the prior regime of 122 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P18-P26) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the beginning of the game. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 9 periods is 110.4 units, significantly lower than the P1-P10 average of approximately 137 units. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=9 to account for the current volatility, which appears higher in the most recent two periods (P25-P26) but generally stable around the lower mean. Regarding lead time, history consistently confirms a lead time of 4 periods (P5 through P26), so I will continue using the default promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 119 on-hand and 312 in-transit, which covers more than 3 periods of the current demand rate at L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 18. The average demand from Period 18 to Period 27 is approximately 107 units per period (114, 128, 117, 106, 101, 79, 86, 127, 134, 99). While there was a brief period of very low demand (approx. 80-90 units) between Periods 23-24, the most recent samples (Periods 25-27) show a return toward the ~105-110 range. Using a recent_N approach with N=10 (covering the period since the confirmed shift at P18) captures this stabilized mean better than the full history. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as seen in the conclude messages through Period 27. On-hand inventory is healthy (113) and in-transit (361) covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand, aligning well with the (L+1) coverage requirement. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to reflect this current regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility and a general downward trend over the last 10 periods. The most recent regime (P18-P28) shows a mean demand of approximately 103 units, which is a decrease from the prior mean of 122 units. Period 28 saw a particularly low demand of 69 units, which may be an outlier or a sign of further cooling. Given the high in-transit inventory (456 units) relative to recent demand (approx. 103 units/period), the pipeline covers more than 4 periods of future demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the stabilized lower demand regime since Period 18 while smoothing out the very recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 further stabilized: Mean demand from P18-P28 is approximately 103 units (std ~22), down from the P11-P17 mean of 122.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P18-P29) continues to show a lower mean of approximately 101 units compared to the initial periods. However, the last two periods (P28 and P29) have shown significantly lower demand (69 and 63 units) than the previous average in this regime. While it is too early to classify this as a new permanent regime shift, I will pivot the forecast to 'recent_N' with N=12 (covering P18-P29) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the broader low-demand environment and the recent volatility without overreacting to just two data points. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Primarily, at Period 18, it dropped from an average of ~122 to ~103. However, looking at the most recent data (P28-P30), demand has been even lower (69, 63, 108), averaging 80. Despite some noise, the sustained drop since P18 is the most reliable changepoint. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 92 and in-transit is 354. Given the lead time of 4, the order plus on-hand plus in-transit should cover 5 periods of demand. I will use the last 13 periods (starting from P18) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current stabilized low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: Recent 3-period average demand has dropped further to 80 units, though volatility remains present.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several downwards regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred around Period 28, with the last four periods (P28-P31) showing demand values of 69, 63, 108, and 104. This averages to approximately 86 units, which is significantly lower than the previous regime (P18-P27) average of approximately 106. Consequently, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this new lower-demand environment for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the current volatility within this new regime. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 4 periods based on historical arrival data (most recently confirmed in the Period 31 conclude message where the P27 order arrived, L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 130 and in-transit is 321, providing sufficient coverage for the inferred lead time of 4 units plus the current decision period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: Average demand decreased from ~106 to ~86 units (-19%) based on P28-P31 data.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant downwards regime shift starting around Period 28. In the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand values were 69, 63, 108, 104, and 85, averaging 85.8 units. This is a noticeable drop from the previous regime average of ~103 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower demand and current volatility. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by the historical arrival records (e.g., the order from P28 arrived in P32). With 151 units on hand and 238 in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the current projected demand, so I'll maintain standard parameters to allow the OR backend to optimize the replenishment order against this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28 confirmed and sustained: Average demand decreased from ~103 to ~86 units (-16%) over the last 5 periods (P28-P32).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 28. Over the last 6 periods (P28-P33), the demand samples are 69, 63, 108, 104, 85, and 95, resulting in an average of 87.3 units. This confirms the previously noted regime shift starting at Period 28 (average reduction from ~103 to ~87). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical conclusions (P29 arrived in P33). We have 113 on-hand and 259 in-transit, totaling 372 units. Setting L=4 (promised) and using recent_N=6 for mu_hat will target a base stock reflecting the current (~87) demand level across the lead-time horizon (1+L=5). This service level is balanced against the $1.0 holding cost by the backend's critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28 confirmed: Average demand has settled at approximately 87 units (P28-P33), down from the previous regime of 103 units.

For Period 35, the relevant regime is from Period 28 to Period 34. Calculating the mean demand for these 7 periods: (69+63+108+104+85+95+107)/7 \u2248 90.14. This is consistent with the carry-over insight noting a stabilized demand around 87-90 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across all 30 observed arrivals (P5-P34). Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 310, and on-hand is 55, totaling 365, which is roughly 4 periods of the current demand (4 * 90 = 360). To maintain the target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) while accounting for the lower mean and current inventory, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the characteristics of the latest stable regime since P28. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (4), as there is no evidence of deviation.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several shifts. Analysis of the most recent data (P28 to P35) shows a mean demand of approximately 94.4 units, with recent periods (P34-P35) showing a slight upward trend (107 and 124 units). This contradicts the previously identified regime shift at Period 28 which suggested a drop to 87 units. Consequently, I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 to reflect this recent increase while acknowledging the volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration since the P28 shift) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive arrivals. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that accounts for the current demand levels (approx. 94 units/period) across the lead time plus the review period (5 periods total), balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28 revised: Mean demand from P28-P35 has stabilized higher at approximately 94 units, up from the previous estimate of 87 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 18.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 28) shows a mean of approximately 96.6 units (P28-P36: 69, 63, 108, 104, 85, 95, 107, 124, 86). Period 36 experienced a stockout because the arrived order (23 units from P32) was insufficient to meet demand (86 units). The in-transit inventory of 428 units consists of orders from P33 (78), P34 (100), P35 (121), and P36 (129). Given the Lead Time is consistently 4 periods, these will arrive in P37, P38, P39, and P40 respectively. I will use a recent_N of 9 (P28-P36) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's behavior (mean ~97, std ~19). Lead time 'L' remains fixed at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28 stabilized: P28-P36 mean is 96.6 (std 19.4), which is fairly stable but slightly higher than the initial P28-P32 estimate of 86.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 28. Calculating from Period 28 to Period 37, the mean demand is 95.1 units per period with a standard deviation of 18.25. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P32 and P33). We have 4 units on-hand and 427 in-transit. The in-transit inventory covers orders from P34, P35, P36, and P37, which are expected to arrive in P38, P39, P40, and P41 respectively. With the game ending at P50, we need to maintain a stable replenishment based on the most recent demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to encompass the stable period from P28 onwards, which ensures the OR backend captures the mean of ~95 and the associated volatility to maintain the service level while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability in the most recent regime starting from Period 28. The current mean demand from Period 28 to Period 38 is approximately 91.8 units, while the standard deviation is around 20.8. The latest demand in Period 38 was significantly lower at 40 units, which might be an outlier or early signal of a shift; however, I will maintain the current regime settings (N=11) to balance responsiveness with stability. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. Inventory levels are healthy with 64 units on-hand and 391 in-transit, which covers the upcoming lead time demand. Use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (P28-P38) to capture the current demand profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift around Period 28. While initial estimates suggested a drop to ~86 units, data from Period 28 to Period 40 (12 periods) shows a mean demand of approximately 90.7 units with a standard deviation of 19.1. Using N=12 for the recent regime captures this stabilization while filtering out the higher-demand periods prior to P28. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand (112) and in-transit (295) inventory levels are sufficient to cover the expected demand throughout the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), so the OR backend will calculate a modest order size to maintain the desired service level (balanced by profit $4 vs holding cost $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28 confirmed and stable: Mean demand for P28-P39 is 90.7 units (std 19.1), a ~12% decrease from the previous P18-P27 mean of ~103.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a lower level starting around Period 28. Calculating the demand statistics from Period 28 to Period 40 (13 periods), the mean demand is 86.6 units with a standard deviation of 22.8 units. The period 40 demand was particularly low at 63 units. The goal is to set parameters that reflect this current lower-demand regime while accounting for the recent variability. With profit at $4 and holding cost at $1, the target service level is high (80%), requiring sufficient safety stock despite the downward trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (178 units) due to the large arrival from Period 36, so the pipeline is well-saturated. I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized but lower-demand regime since P28. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28 refined: P28-P40 mean demand is 86.6 units (std 22.8), representing a significant sustained decrease from early game averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained downward trend. Reviewing recent data from Period 28 to 41, the mean demand is approximately 86.6 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. In the very latest periods (P38-P41), demand has been even lower (40, 73, 63, 58), suggesting the regime might represent a new local low or increased volatility. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P37 order arrived P41). Currently, we have 197 units on hand and 209 units in transit (ordered in P38-P41: 64, 25, 66, 54). Total inventory of 406 units covers over 4 periods of demand at the current average. To account for the lower recent demand and prevent excessive holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the recent N=14 (from P28 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime while maintaining a buffer against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28 refined: P28-P41 mean demand is 84.6 units (std 22.2), with the most recent 4 periods (P38-P41) averaging only 58.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and sustained downward trend. The most recent demand regime, starting around Period 28, has seen a further drop in the last five periods (P38-P42), with demand values of 40, 73, 63, 58, and 63, averaging approximately 59.4 units. This is a substantial decrease from the earlier Period 28 regime average of ~85-90. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 198 and in-transit at 194 (covering approximately 6.6 periods of the current 59-unit demand), the current inventory position is very high. I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this lower demand environment (~60 units/period * 5 periods = 300) to prevent the OR backend from over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the 50-period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Recent 5-period average demand has dropped to 59.4 units, a ~30% decrease from the previous P28-P37 average of ~87 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant and sustained decrease, entering a new regime around Period 38. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P38-P43) is 59.7 units (40, 73, 63, 58, 63, 61), which is a substantial drop from the previous Period 28-37 average of approximately 97 units. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43. With 162 units on-hand and 169 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 331), and a projected demand of approximately 60 units per period, the current inventory covers over 5 periods of demand (L+1). Consequently, the OR backend is correctly suggesting a zero or minimal order to avoid escalating holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this latest demand shift precisely, and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current lower volatility (std ~11 in the last 6 periods vs ~20 previously).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38 confirmed: Average demand has decreased significantly to approximately 60 units (P38-P43) from the previous P28-P37 average of ~97 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant sustained decrease, stabilizing at a much lower regime. Starting at Period 38, the demand dropped from an average of ~97 to ~63.7 over the last 7 periods (P38-P44). Given the game is approaching the end (Period 45 of 50) and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive at Period 49. With 149 units on-hand and 103 units in-transit (arriving in P46, P47, and P48), we have 252 units to cover the remaining 6 periods (P45-P50). At the current demand rate of ~64 units/period, total remaining expected demand is ~384 units. However, to avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods for a product with relatively low profit relative to holding cost ($4 profit vs $1 holding), I will conservatively use the recent 7-period average (N=7) for the mu_hat forecast to ensure we don't over-order. The pipeline and on-hand inventory already cover a significant portion of the remaining game life.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38 further confirmed: Mean demand from P38-P44 is 62.6 units (std 11.8), representing a ~35% decrease from the P28-P37 average of ~96.5.

The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P38-P45) is 61.5 units (40, 73, 63, 58, 63, 61, 79, 55). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand 148 + in-transit 132 = 280) is relatively high given the new demand reality. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the remaining 5 periods of the game, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 8-period regime (N=8) to reflect this lower demand level of ~62 units per period. Sigma_hat is also updated using the same window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_38 confirmed and stable: Mean demand for P38-P45 is 61.5 units (std 11.2), roughly a 35% decrease from the P28-P37 average.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent sustained shift occurring at Period 38. From Period 38 to Period 46, demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level, averaging approximately 61 units with a standard deviation of about 11. Specifically, the last four periods (P43-P46) had demands of 61, 79, 55, and 48. This confirms the previously identified regime at Period 38 is stable. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering P38-P46) to capture this lower volume and reduced volatility accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P38-P42 in P42-P46. Current on-hand inventory (149) plus in-transit (133) equals 282 units. With demand expected to be around 61 per period, our pipeline covers more than 4 periods of demand, which is appropriate given the 4-period lead time. No new sustained patterns have emerged since the last insight.

Daily Reward (R_t): $246.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new regime starting at Period 38. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P38-P47) is approximately 61.9 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by historical arrivals. Period 47 conclude shows arrived=0, which is normal as the order from Period 43 (ordered=0) would have arrived in this period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 70 and in-transit is 174 (orders from P44, P45, P46, P47). Total pipeline (244 units) is sufficient to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods based on the current mean (~310 units needed), but we are approaching the end of the game (total 50 periods). With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to reflect the stabilized lower demand regime accurately while avoiding over-stocking at the game's conclusion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, with a confirmed demand regime shift since Period 38. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P38-P48) is approximately 59 units. Although the promised lead time is 4 periods, we observed two consecutive periods (P47 and P48) with zero arrivals despite orders being placed in P43 and P44 (which were for 0 units). This is expected based on the zero-unit orders. However, looking at the pipeline, an order of 83 units from P45 is due to arrive in P49. We have 41 units on-hand and 257 units in-transit. Given the impending end of the simulation (Period 50), the main priority is preventing excess inventory while covering the remaining 2 periods of demand, including the current Period 49. The current in-transit and on-hand inventory (298 units) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~120 units for the final two periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 periods (N=11) to reflect the stabilized lower demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing around 61.5 units (P38-P45). However, very recent demand (P47-P49) has shown higher volatility (79, 29, 91). I am using a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P38 regime while allowing for the recent volatility to influence the buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory stands at 200 units, which includes orders from Period 46 (50), 47 (41), 48 (83), and 49 (26). The current on-hand inventory is 33. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand (~300-400 units). With 233 units total (on-hand + pipeline), the OR backend will order to reach the calculated base stock.
