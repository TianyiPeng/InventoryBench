Historical demand for the first 5 periods indicates an average demand of approximately 175 units (187, 189, 158, 158, 184). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I am currently facing lost sales for the first 4 periods because any order placed now will not arrive until Period 5 (assuming lead time is 4). To optimize total reward, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). A safe base forecast is ~175 units per period. Target inventory level = 175 * 5 = 875 units. I will order 875 units now to establish the pipeline and reach a stable stock level by Period 5. Although holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), which usually suggests a lower service level (Newsboy critical fractile ~0.5), the initial stockout is unavoidable, so I must start the pipeline immediately.",

  "rationale": "The recent demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' continues at an average of approximately 50-60 units per period (average of P40-P45 is ~50). The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. As of the start of Period 46, on-hand inventory is very low at 6 units. The game ends at Period 50, meaning orders placed now (P46) will arrive during Period 50 (P46+4=50), which is the final period. Orders placed after today (P47 onwards) will not arrive before the game ends. Pipeline check: In-transit contains orders from P42 (40), P43 (120), P44 (40), and P45 (120). Expected arrivals are: P46 (order from P42: 40 units), P47 (order from P43: 120 units), P48 (order from P44: 40 units), and P49 (order from P45: 120 units). Current inventory plus expected arrivals for the remainder of the game (6 + 40 + 120 + 40 + 120 = 326) far exceeds the total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (roughly 5 * 55 = 275). To avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods while ensuring demand is met, I will not place any further orders.",

Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders placed today (P47) will arrive at the end of P51, which is outside the game's horizon. Therefore, the goal is to manage the remaining inventory and in-transit shipments to cover the last 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50). Current On-hand is 17. In-transit consists of orders from P43 (120 units), P44 (40 units), and P45 (120 units). Based on L=4, the P43 order (120 units) arrives at the end of P47 (available for P48). Total expected inventory for the final periods is: On-hand (17) + P43 arrival (120) + P44 arrival (40, arriving end of P48) + P45 arrival (120, arriving end of P49). Total = 297 units. With 4 periods remaining and an average demand of ~55, the total expected demand is ~220 units. We already have enough in the pipeline to meet all remaining demand without further ordering. Placing a new order would only incur unnecessary holding costs at the end of the game or arrive too late.",

  "rationale": "The current demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable at approximately 55-60 units per period (average demand from P41-P47 is ~47 units, though recent P47 spiked to 76). With the simulation ending at Period 50, we are now in the final decision cycles. In Period 48, we have 61 units on-hand and 160 units in-transit. The in-transit pipeline consists of: P44 order (40 units) arriving in P48 resolution, P45 order (120 units) arriving in P49 resolution, and P46/P47 orders (0 units). Given a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed in P48 would arrive in the resolution phase of P52, which is beyond the P50 limit. Since we already have 61 units on-hand and expect 40 more to arrive this period (total 101 for P49 demand) and 120 more in P49 (total 221 available for P50), we are significantly over-stocked for the remaining 3 periods of demand (estimated ~150-180 units total). Placing further orders would only increase holding costs without contributing to sales.",

Due to the confirmed 4-period lead time (L=4), any order placed in Period 49 will arrive in Period 53 (at the earliest), which is beyond the game's horizon of 50 periods. Existing in-transit inventory (120 units) consists of orders from P45 (120 units) which are scheduled to arrive at the end of Period 49 (becoming available for P50). Current on-hand inventory is 64 units, and expected demand for P49 and P50 (combined) is approximately 100 units based on the recent average. On-hand (64) plus expected arrival for P50 (120) totals 184 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand.
