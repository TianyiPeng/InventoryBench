Recently, over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand has dropped to approximately 50 units per period, significantly lower than the historical starting mean of ~180. We are currently in Period 46 with only 5 periods remaining in the game (target end: Period 50). Current inventory on-hand is 245 units, and there are 50 units in-transit (ordered P44, expected arrival P48). Total pipeline inventory is 295 units. Given the current demand average of ~50, total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods is approximately 250 units (5 periods * 50 units/period). Our current 295 units are more than sufficient to cover all remaining demand. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs of $1/unit/period without increasing revenue.
