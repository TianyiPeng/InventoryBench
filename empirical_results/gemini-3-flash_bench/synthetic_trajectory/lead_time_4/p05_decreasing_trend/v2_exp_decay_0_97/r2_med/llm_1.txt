The total in-transit pipeline is 350 units. According to the 4-period lead time rule: 1) The order from P41 (150 units) is expected to arrive during P45. 2) The order from P42 (80 units) is expected to arrive in P46. 3) The order from P44 (120 units) is expected to arrive in P48. Including P45, there are 6 periods remaining in the game. Total remaining demand is estimated at 342 units (6 periods * 57 avg). Total supply is 350 units (all in-transit). Since on-hand inventory is empty at the start of P45, the 150 units arriving during P45 will satisfy P45's demand (~57) and leave ~93 for P46. With the 80 units arriving in P46, we will have ~173 available for P46 demand. Given the excessive pipeline relative to the remaining time and demand, and the risk of holding costs at the end of the game, no additional order is placed.",

The current on-hand (116) plus total pipeline (200) equals 316 units. This is sufficient to cover the remaining demand for Periods 46-50 (5 periods * ~50 units/period = 250 units) plus a safety buffer. Ordering more would likely increase ending inventory and incur unnecessary holding costs without increasing sales, as the game ends at Period 50. Therefore, I will set the order to 0.",
