The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. Based on the historical demand samples provided (187, 189, 158, 158, 184), the average demand is approximately 175 units per period. The OR recommendation suggests a quantity of 202 units, calculated using the promised lead time of 4 and a critical fractile of 0.8 ($4 profit / ($4 profit + $1 holding cost)). To ensure coverage for the lead time (L) plus the review period (1), we need to cover demand for 5 periods. 175 * 5 = 875 units. However, the OR recommendation is capped at 202. Since we have zero pipeline and zero on-hand, and the lead time is long (4 periods), a single order of 202 is insufficient to cover the total lead-time demand, but the OR cap is designed to smooth large swings. Given this is the first period and we need to build the pipeline quickly to avoid stockouts in Period 5/6, I will follow the OR recommendation as a conservative start, noting that we will need to continue ordering in subsequent periods to build the necessary pipeline of ~875 units.",

Inventory & Pipeline: Current in-transit is 422 (202 + 220). Since demand occurred in P1 and P2 while inventory was 0, those sales are lost. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 231 units is based on the promised lead time of 4. Given that we have 0 on-hand and need to cover a lead time of 4 plus the current review period (L+1=5), the total target stock should handle 5 periods of demand (~1100 units). Total Pipeline (422) + Current Order (231) = 653 units. This looks low relative to the 5-period requirement if demand remains at 220.

These are expected to arrive in P37, P38, P39, and P40 respectively. The OR recommendation of 209 is extremely high because it uses historical averages and sees 0 on-hand inventory, failing to account for the massive pipeline relative to the current low demand.

Expected arrivals: P47: 50 units (P43 order), P48: 50 units (P44 order), P49: 50 units (P45 order), P50: Current order.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P41-P45) has averaged ~45 units per period. The 50-period game limit is approaching. We have 5 periods remaining (P46-P50).\n4. **Total Requirement**: Projected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46 to P50) at a rate of ~50 units/period is 250 units. Current total assets (On-hand + In-transit) = 64 + 150 = 214 units. \n5. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation of 203 units is based on historical averages (including early-game high-demand periods) and doesn't account for the game nearing its conclusion (P50). Ordering 203 units would result in a massive overstock (64 + 150 + 203 = 417 units vs. ~250 units needed), incurring heavy holding costs.\n6. **Decision**: Need approximately 36 more units to cover the remaining periods (250 total need - 214 currently available).

Demand Analysis: The demand has shifted significantly lower, currently averaging approximately 50 units per period over the last 10 periods. The simulation ends at Period 50. Total expected demand for the remaining periods (P47-P50) is approximately 200 units (4 periods * 50 units). Current inventory + pipeline (35 + 200 = 235) already exceeds this expected total demand. Strategy: Ordering additional units now at Period 47 would arrive in Period 51 (due to the 4-period lead time), which is beyond the game's horizon of 50 periods.

In-transit inventory is 150 units, consisting of orders from P44 (50), P45 (50), and P46 (50). Given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, these arrivals are expected as follows: P44 arrives in P48 (after the current decision), P45 arrives in P49, and P46 arrives in P50. Any order placed in P48 would arrive in P52, which is beyond the game's horizon (P50). Therefore, the 150 units in transit plus the 9 on-hand (total 159) are the only units available to satisfy demand for the remainder of the game. Recent demand has stabilized in a low regime (avg ~50-60 units). Over the next 3 periods, expected total demand is approximately 150-180 units. Since new orders placed now will not arrive before the game ends, ordering more would only incur costs without the possibility of sales.

The OR algorithm uses all historical demand samples (dating back to Period 1, when demand was ~200), resulting in an elevated base-stock level.
