Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The demand history for the first five periods (Period 1-5) is provided: [187, 189, 158, 158, 184]. The mean demand across these five samples is 175.2 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since there is no prior history of arrivals yet, I will use the promised lead time and calculate the initial base stock parameters based on the 5 provided historical samples. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. mu_hat should be approximately 175.2 * 5 = 876. sigma_hat will be estimated from the volatility of these 5 samples (std dev \u2248 15.6) scaled by sqrt(5) \u2248 34.8. I will use the 'explicit' method for the first period to ensure the starting inventory covers the lead time plus current demand immediately, given on-hand is 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 201 units were ordered, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they will not arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 (demand was 218). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 175.4 (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) over the 5 pre-game samples. Since P1 demand was 218, which is slightly higher than the mean, I will use all available historical data (including P1) to estimate demand. The lead time is currently within expectations (L=4). Using default parameters handles the (1+L) logic correctly.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 are still in transit (421 units total), which is expected as the first arrival should occur in Period 5 (L=4). Demand in Period 1 (218) and Period 2 (224) is slightly higher than the provided historical samples (mean ~175). Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2, the pipeline is critical. The OR backend will use the L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to set the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher demand trend (avg 221) compared to the older historical samples, ensuring the base stock reacts to the current demand level. L remains 'default' (4) as no actual lead counts have concluded yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (N=1) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (N+L = 1+4) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, current arrivals being 0 is consistent with the promised lead time. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a high demand (mean ~200) but we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 649 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand samples show a range of 158-224. Since we have no completed lead-time cycles yet, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial behavior. The 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the 5 provided historical samples (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) to estimate the mean and volatility for the upcoming periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the game just concluded Period 4, we expect the first shipment (ordered in Period 1) to arrive DURING Period 5. Consequently, we will only see confirmation of this arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have had time to arrive, resulting in lost sales for the first 4 periods. Total in-transit is 888 units (201+220+228+239). The demand over the first four periods has been [218, 224, 184, 173], averaging 199.75 units. Period 5 demand is listed in the prompt as 184. Using all 5 samples (mean = 196.6, std = 28.0), and assuming the promised lead time L=4 is accurate until proven otherwise, the OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $639.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The first shipment ordered in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the lead time is 4, we must account for demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Demand data for the first five periods (218, 224, 184, 173, 168) suggests an average of 193.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 25.8. However, there is a visible downward trend in demand over the last three periods. To remain responsive to this trend and avoid excess holding costs (given the $1.0 holding cost vs $4.0 profit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full history while being sensitive to the recent levels. The lead time remains consistent with the promised 4 periods, so 'default' is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Order P1 arrived in P5, Order P2 arrived in P6). On-hand inventory is 104 units, with 763 units in-transit (Orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand has shown a slight downward trend over the last 6 periods: P1:218, P2:224, P3:184, P4:173, P5:168, P6:149. The average demand across all 6 periods is 186, but the most recent 3-4 periods suggest a lower stable level around 160-170. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the more recent lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use default L (4 periods) as it has been confirmed accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $458.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, as evidenced by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand history (P1: 218, P2: 224, P3: 184, P4: 173, P5: 168, P6: 149, P7: 158) shows a clear shift. The first two periods averaged ~221 units, while the subsequent five periods (P3-P7) show a stabilized lower demand averaging ~166.4 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. With on-hand inventory at 174 and in-transit at 539 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), the total pipeline of 713 units is positioned to cover the expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon (approx 166 * 5 = 830 units). The parameters are set to maintain this coverage while accounting for the lower mean and variance observed in the recent 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand stabilized at ~166 units starting from Period 3, down from ~221 in Periods 1-2.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent arrivals from Periods 1-4). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 3. Using the last 6 samples (Periods 3-8), the mean demand is 166.7 units. The current on-hand inventory is 245 units, and in-transit is 445 units (total pipeline = 690). Since the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 166.7 = 833.5 units. With 690 units already accounted for, the system will order to bridge the gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand regime and 'default' for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing historical data, the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1-P5 orders arriving in P5-P9). Demand analysis confirms a shift at Period 3: Periods 1-2 averaged 221 units, while Periods 3-9 averaged 168.5 units. The most recent demand (P9) was 180, suggesting the stabilized regime is roughly 165-180 units. For chips(Regular), the target service level (q) is 0.8 (Profit 4 / (4+1)). I will use recent_N with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this post-P3 regime (Periods 3-9), and recent_N with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand while avoiding inventory bloat from the initial high-demand phase.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods, with orders from Periods 1 through 6 arriving exactly as promised. The demand has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 3. For the last 8 periods (Period 3 to Period 10), the mean demand is approximately 168.6 units (min: 149, max: 184) with a standard deviation of 10.8. I will use N=8 for demand and volatility to capture this stable regime while excluding the higher noise from the first two periods. We have 198 units on hand and 504 units in transit (expected arrivals from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10). The base stock target will be set to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime shift noted in Carry-Over Insights remains consistent: since Period 3, the average demand has been approximately 164.2 units (Periods 3-11), compared to the initial higher mean. I will use a recent_N of 9 (Periods 3-11) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is currently 659 units, representing orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11, which are expected to arrive sequentially over the next four periods. The lead time L is set to its prometised default of 4, which aligns with all historical observations (Periods 5-11 confirm L=4).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable after an initial drop at Period 3. From Period 3 to Period 12, the average demand is approximately 157.2 units, significantly lower than the ~221 units seen in the first two periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals in Periods 5 through 12). For Period 13, I will focus on the stable demand regime starting from Period 3. Since there are 10 samples in this regime (P3-P12), I use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture current demand patterns and volatility. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead times are consistent with the promised lead time of 4. This setup will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers 1 + 4 = 5 periods of demand while keeping holding costs in check.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 158 units since Period 3. Observations from Period 3 to Period 13 show consistent demand within a narrow range (135 to 184). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (all arrivals from P1 to P9 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Currently, there is 99 units on-hand and 606 units in-transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13). To calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N approach with N=11 (Periods 3 through 13) to capture the current stable demand regime while excluding the higher initial demand seen in Periods 1-2. This ensures the OR engine sets a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) at the optimal service level.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~158 units over the last 12 periods (P3-P14), which is lower than the initial periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every delivery from Period 5 through Period 14. Currently, we have 153 units on-hand and 544 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14), which totals 697 units of pipeline inventory. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level, I am setting L to the default promised lead time of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the stable regime from P3-P14 (mean ~158). For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect the variance of this current stable period. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current demand rather than the higher initial levels.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~150 units per period since Period 11, following an earlier shift around Period 3. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), the average demand is exactly 141.6 units with a low standard deviation. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (L=4). The inventory position is currently healthy (153 on-hand + 510 in-transit), but the incoming pipeline depends on maintaining a steady flow based on this lower demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent stabilization while avoiding the influence of the higher demand seen in early periods (P1-P2 and P3-P10). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates and minimizes unnecessary holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: mean stabilized further at ~142 units (down from ~166 units in P3-P10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $303.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level. After an initial drop around Period 3, a second significant shift occurred starting at Period 11. Specifically, from Period 11 to Period 16, the mean demand is approximately 137.3 units (135, 144, 136, 134, 159, 116), down from the previous regime's average of ~166. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. Pipeline inventory is currently 451 units with an on-hand stock of 161 (total 612), which is sufficient to cover approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest demand regime (starting P11) and use the 'default' lead time of 4.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~136 units over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), shifting down from the previous regime of ~166. Specifically, demand from P11 to P17 was 135, 144, 136, 134, 159, 116, 131. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P1-P13 orders all arrived with L=4). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this most recent stable demand regime (P11-P17). This will ensure the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods of demand) is calibrated to the lower current consumption rate, helping to reduce excess inventory while maintaining service levels given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around ~130 units since Period 11 (P11-P18 mean = 133.1). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With high on-hand (181) and pipeline inventory (416), the system is currently over-inventoried relative to the recent demand mean of ~133. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture this lower demand level accurately and prevent excessive ordering. Using L=default aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a progressive downward trend. Initial demand (P1-P2) averaged ~221, followed by a regime (P3-P10) averaging ~166, and the most recent stable regime (P11-P19) averaging ~131. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P16-P19) show even lower demand averaging ~113. Given the current on-hand inventory of 209 and a high in-transit pipeline (389 units), there is a risk of overstocking if the demand forecast isn't adjusted conservatively. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N=9 (representing the period since the last major regime shift at P11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility within this period. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: average demand decreased further to ~131 units (observed P11-P19), with a possible emerging trend towards ~113 units based on the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $366.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained downward trend. The most recent regime shift occurred around Period 11, where demand stabilized near ~142 units, but the last 5 periods (P16-P20) show a further decline with an average of approximately 116 units (116, 131, 110, 97, 128). Specifically, the average of the last 10 periods (P11-P20) is ~127 units. Given the carry-over insight noting a possible trend towards ~113-131 units, I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this lower regime while maintaining some stability against individual period noise. Lead time (L) is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised value. Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the last 10 samples to reflect the current reduced volatility levels. On-hand inventory is 146 and in-transit is 407 (Total pipeline: 553), which is quite high relative to the ~127 unit demand. The OR backend should significantly reduce or zero out the order to bleed off this excess inventory while maintaining service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: average demand decreased further to ~116-127 units (observed P11-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $457.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a lower mean. Over the last 11 periods (P11-P21), the average demand is 129.5 units. The most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) show an average of 121.4 units, while the last 3 periods (P19-P21) show 122 units. A recent_N of 10 for mu_hat is appropriate to capture this lower stabilized demand (approx 128/period) while smoothing recent fluctuations. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). The OR backend uses a pipeline-aware base stock policy; with current on-hand inventory at 107 and in-transit at 431 (total pipeline 538), the backend will compare this against a base stock level calculated for L+1 (5 periods) of demand. Given a mean of ~128/period, 5 periods requirement is ~640. Current pipeline of 538 suggests an order of ~100 units will be triggered to maintain service levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 11. Over the last 12 periods (P11-P22), the mean demand is 127.5 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) show a mean of 115.4, while specifically the last 3 periods show 123.3. There is a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, which has remained consistent through Period 22. On-hand inventory is 130, and in-transit is 451, totaling 581 units of pipeline inventory. This inventory significantly exceeds the expected demand over the next 5 periods (approximately 120 * 5 = 600). To avoid excessive holding costs from over-ordering during this lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 12 to capture the distribution since the shift at Period 11, while keeping the lead time L at the default promised value of 4.

The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a continued downward trend, with recent periods (P19-P23) averaging approximately 109 units (97, 128, 141, 101, 79). This indicates a shift from the previous regime that averaged ~142. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 149 and In-transit at 445 (total pipeline 594), and a current average demand of ~109, the inventory position covers over 5 periods of demand. To adjust for the lower demand profile and avoid excessive holding costs, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (P19-P23) to capture this most recent downward shift. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target and order only what is necessary to maintain that level, considering the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: average demand decreased further to ~109 units (observed P19-P23).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent downward trend. A significant regime shift was identified around Period 24, where recent demand (P19-P24) has averaged approximately 107 units per period (97, 128, 141, 101, 79, 97). The most recent three periods (P22-P24) show an even lower average of 92.3 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory management now must account for this lower demand level to avoid excessive holding costs. For Period 25, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this lower regime starting from Period 19. Sigma_hat will also use N=6 to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been highly consistent across all concluded orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: average demand stabilized at ~107 units (observed P19-P24), representing a significant decrease from previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent downward trend. The most recent demand regime, starting around Period 19, shows an average demand of approximately 101 units (P19: 97, P20: 128, P21: 141, P22: 101, P23: 79, P24: 97, P25: 87). The last four periods (P22-P25) are even lower, averaging ~91 units. Given this decline, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 samples (recent_N=7) to capture this lower volume accurately while maintaining some buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory of 174 and in-transit of 318 (total pipeline of 492) is currently high relative to the (L+1) demand of ~500 units, which justifies a conservative order approach. sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 7 samples to reflect the recent volatility in this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: average demand has further decreased to ~91 units (observed P22-P25), continuing the downward trend identified in earlier periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend, as noted in the carry-over insights. Over the last five periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 91.2 units (101, 79, 97, 87, 92), confirming the regime shift identified at Period 22. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 226 units and in-transit at 246 units (ordered in P23-P26), the current pipeline is significant relative to the lower demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current regime starting from P22, ensuring the OR backend adapts to this lower volume and manages the holding costs for the existing surplus. The lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~91 units (P22-P26), down from the ~107 units observed in the previous regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Based on the last 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged 92.83 units (sd \u2248 8.8), confirming the logic in the carry-over insights that the mean has shifted down to approximately 91-93 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (217 units) and 155 units in transit (expected arrivals from P24-P27), current inventory levels safely cover the (L+1) = 5 period outlook. We use recent_N=6 to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using default lead time since 4 periods remains the stable observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new lower regime. Observing the most recent periods (P22-P28), demand has averaged approximately 88 units (101, 79, 97, 87, 92, 101, 61), which is a significant decrease from the previous regime of ~107 units. The last period (P28) showed an even lower demand of 61 units, suggesting the downward trend might still be settling. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 156 and in-transit at 263 (total pipeline of 419), we are well-covered for the lead time + review period (5 periods) given the current demand mean of ~88. I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture this specific low-demand regime (P22-P28), and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the current volatility. Although Period 28 saw 0 units arrive, this is expected as Period 24 had an order of 0 units, which was due to arrive in Period 28 (L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~88 units (P22-P28), continuing the downward trend from the previous ~107 unit level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 88 units since Period 22, based on the recent history (P22-P29). There was a skipped shipment in Period 28 (order from Period 24), which appears to be a lost shipment as the order from Period 25 arrived in Period 29. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods for completed shipments. On-hand inventory is 164 with 231 units in-transit (P26-P29 orders). To optimize for the current demand regime (~88 units/period), I'm using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand environment while maintaining a safety stock that accounts for the profit/holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0). The OR backend's capped policy will manage the order size relative to the pipeline inventory and current on-hand levels.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 24 is likely lost: Period 25 order arrived on P29 (LT=4), but P24 order (due P28) did not arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained downward trend, with the most recent stable regime (starting P22) averaging approximately 81 units per period (P22-P30: 101, 79, 97, 87, 92, 101, 61, 74, 45). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, although a shipment from Period 24 is likely lost as the Period 25 and 26 orders have already arrived (P29 and P30 respectively). Currently, on-hand inventory (191) and remaining in-transit units (224) are high relative to the decreasing demand. Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the latest regime's lower mean and higher volatility efficiently. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if further ordering is needed to maintain the base stock level required for the L+1 window while factoring in the high holding cost ($1.0) and profit ($4.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: average demand decreased further to ~81 units (observed P22-P30). Shipment from Period 24 (0 units ordered) confirmed lost/skipped as P25 and P26 orders arrived.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-22.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a progressive downward trend, with a significant shift confirmed around Period 22. From Period 22 to Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 77.1 units (771/10), and the last five periods (P27-P31) show an even lower average of 63 units, indicating the trend may still be descending or stabilizing at a very low level. I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect this current regime (P22-P31) while giving some weight to the higher demand at the start of the period to avoid under-ordering if demand rebounds slightly. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages. The shipment from Period 24 (which was 0 units) did not arrive, but since it was a zero-order, it does not affect current on-hand/in-transit reconciliations. Pipeline inventory is currently 254 and on-hand is 158, totaling 412 units, which is high relative to the ~77 unit demand. The OR backend will naturally reduce orders due to this excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~77 units (observed P22-P31), showing a persistent downward trend compared to the previous ~88-91 unit estimates.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to show a significant downward trend, with the most recent regime starting around Period 22. In the last 11 periods (P22-P32), the average demand has dropped to approximately 77 units (Total 844 / 11 periods), compared to previous averages of 88-107. The most recent three periods (P30-P32) averaged only 50.6 units, but I will use a more robust N=11 to capture the current regime more reliably without overreacting to the very low P30-P31. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P28 order arrived in P32), although the P24 shipment remains lost. On-hand inventory is currently high (193 units), and there are 164 units in-transit (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). With approximately 357 units total available against a demand forecast of ~77 per period, we are well-covered for the (L+1) window. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to reflect this lower demand environment, allowing the OR backend to adjust orders downward and minimize holding costs while maintaining the target service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent downward trend. Since Period 22, the average demand has dropped to approximately 71 units, with the most recent three periods (P31-P33) averaging 60.6 units. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this lower regime starting from P22 (N=33-22+1=12). The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P29-P33). On-hand inventory is 168 units, and in-transit is 183 units, totaling 351 units of pipeline inventory. This is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1) at the current rate (~300-350 units). The sigma_hat is also calculated using the same recent window to reflect the reduced volatility in the lower demand regime. The OR backend will likely order a small amount or zero to continue drawing down excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: average demand decreased further to ~71 units (observed P22-P33).

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend, with the most recent regime starting around Period 22.

I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent stabilization/decline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, despite the confirmed loss of the Period 24 shipment (which had an order quantity of 0, so it did not impact inventory but explains the missing 'conclude' message).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Average demand has decreased further to ~57 units (observed P30-P34), continuing the established long-term downward trend.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend, with the most recent regime starting around Period 30 averaging approximately 57.6 units per period (P30: 45, P31: 34, P32: 73, P33: 75, P34: 58, P35: 68). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as evidenced by the Period 31 order arriving in Period 35. One shipment (Period 24, though it was for 0 units) was confirmed lost or skipped earlier. Currently, on-hand inventory is 138 units and in-transit is 160 units (from Period 32-35 orders). Given the lead time of 4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With the current avg demand around 58, the 5-period requirement is ~290. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 298, which is slightly above the requirement. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average of ~58 per period using recent_N (N=6) to capture this most recent stabilization/decline, while keeping sigma_hat at recent levels to account for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~59 units (observed P30-P35), continuing the long-term downward trend.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a persistent downward trend. The most recent regime shift identified in Period 35/36 shows demand stabilizing at approximately 59 units per period (based on Periods 30-36). This coincides with our decision to use recent demand data to avoid over-ordering during this decline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, despite the confirmed loss of the Period 24 shipment. Pipeline inventory is currently 170 units (orders from P33, P34, P35, P36), and on-hand is 124 units. To reflect the most recent and relevant demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7), which covers the period from P30 to P36, where the shift to ~59 units was observed. This helps the OR backend correctly calculate the base stock for the current lower-demand regime while maintaining a 4-period lead time assumption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a significant downward trend. Analysis of the most recent period (P30-P37) shows an average demand of approximately 53.75 units (45, 34, 73, 75, 58, 68, 32, 45). The previous regime estimate was 59 units. To prevent excessive overstocking given the current on-hand inventory of 148 units (which covers nearly 3 periods of recent demand) and an in-transit pipeline of 117 units, I am reducing the mean demand forecast (mu_hat). I will use the recent_N method with N=8 to capture this latest stabilization at a lower level (~54 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the historical loss of the Period 24 shipment. The chosen parameters aim to lower the base stock level to align with the current demand reality, thereby minimizing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~54 units (observed P30-P37), continuing the long-term downward trend.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained long-term downward trend. The most recent regime shift (confirmed at Period 30) shows demand has stabilized around a mean of ~54 units (observed P30-P38: 45, 34, 73, 75, 58, 68, 32, 45, 29). The standard deviation for this specific period is approximately 18.2. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the exception of the confirmed lost shipment from Period 24. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 192 and there are 81 units in transit (expected arrivals from Periods 35-38). Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new lower demand (192 units / 54 units/period \u2248 3.5 periods of safety), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current demand mean and volatility while allowing the OR engine to reduce ordering to align with the lower demand regime and minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its significant downward trend. Analyzing the most recent regime starting from Period 30, the average demand is approximately 53.4 units (P30-P39: 45, 34, 73, 75, 58, 68, 32, 45, 29, 80). The latest observation of 80 units is slightly higher than the recent average but still aligns with the volatility of this lower regime. My carry-over insights confirm that the shipment from Period 24 was lost, and Period 35's 'ordered=0' means no shipment is expected in Period 39 (which is confirmed by 'arrived=0' in the P39 conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 112 with 97 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, P38, P39). With L=4, the safety stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the new lower demand mean (~53), the OR backend will likely minimize new orders to reduce holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current regime (P30-P39), and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~53 units (observed P30-P39), continuing the long-term downward trend.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a significant long-term downward trend. The most recent regime, starting at Period 30, shows a stabilized mean of approximately 53 units (based on P30-P40 data). The shipment from Period 35 (0 units ordered) technically means nothing arrives from that specific cycle in Period 39, which explains the 'arrived=0' despite no lost shipment signal. The shipment from Period 36 arrived on time in Period 40 (LT=4). Current on-hand inventory is 68 units with 155 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of 53, we need roughly 265 units in the pipeline. Current total (68 + 155 = 223) suggests we are slightly under-stocked for the 5-period window if we want to maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (P30 to P40) to capture this latest demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the default promised lead time as it remains stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 30. Comparing the last 12 periods (P30-P41), the mean demand is approximately 53.6 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Although Period 39 and 40 showed temporary spikes (80 and 72), Period 41 returned to 50, consistent with the identified regime. I am using recent_N=12 for demand forecasting to capture this stabilized lower mean while accounting for recent variability. Regarding inventory, we have 34 units on-hand and 227 units in-transit. A shipment from Period 35 (0 units ordered) technically 'arrived' in the logic, and we are currently awaiting the shipment from Period 38 (37 units), which is due to arrive in Period 42 (current decision period resolution). The in-transit pipeline is quite large relative to current demand, but much of it consists of orders placed in the last few periods (P40=86, P41=88) to replenish the declining on-hand stock. The parameters are set to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand at the current 53-54 unit average.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a significant downward trend, with the most recent confirmed regime (starting Period 30) showing an average demand of approximately 53 units. However, looking at the very recent data from Period 35 to 42 (32, 45, 29, 80, 72, 50, 26), the mean is approximately 47.7 units. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P36, P37, and P38 orders arrived exactly at L=4). Note: The Period 35 order (0 units) and the lack of an arrival in Period 39 (consistent with P35 being 0) confirms L=4 is reliable. Currently, On-hand inventory is 45 and In-transit is 239. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At a forecast of ~50 units/period, target pipeline is ~250 units. Total inventory (45 + 239 = 284) is slightly above the target base stock, but given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8), we maintain a safe buffer. I will use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime since Period 30, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~48 units (observed P35-P42), continuing the long-term downward trend.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its established long-term downward trend. The most recent regime (starting Period 35) shows even lower average demand compared to the Period 30 regime. Calculating the mean from Period 35 through Period 43 (demands: 68, 32, 45, 29, 80, 72, 50, 26, 50), the current average is approximately 50.2 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P36-P39 orders arriving on schedule). The current on-hand inventory is low (11 units), but there are 240 units in-transit, which is significant relative to the current demand rate (~50 units/period). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture this most recent stabilized regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility accurately. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~50 units (observed P35-P43), continuing the downward trend.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several downward shifts, with the most recent regime stabilizing at an average of approximately 50 units per period starting from Period 35. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), demand has averaged 47.6 units. Given the game is approaching its end (Period 45 of 50), managing the terminal inventory is crucial to avoid high holding costs. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 40 order in Period 44. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 30 units and a massive in-transit pipeline of 191 units (orders from P41 to P44), totaling 221 units against a remaining demand for ~5-6 periods (approx 250-300 units). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent demand behavior, and use 'default' for lead time (4 periods). This setup ensures the base stock reflects the current ~50 unit demand level while accounting for the high pipeline already in place.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term downward trend, which became more pronounced around Period 30 and Period 35. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is approximately 48.4 units. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P41-P45), the mean is around 45.4 units. Given this sustained decline, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11 (tracking the regime since P35) to capture this lower mean while maintaining enough samples to buffer the observed variance (sigma_hat also uses N=11). Historical lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (P41 order arriving P45) confirming this. The inventory position (On-hand: 84, In-transit: 178) is relatively high compared to the current low demand environment, so the OR backend will likely scale back orders to avoid excessive holding costs as the game approaches its conclusion at Period 50.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a long-term downward trend, which stabilized around 50 units/period since Period 35. Over the last 12 periods (P35-P46), the average demand is 48.75 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Recent demand in the last two periods (P45-P46) has been even lower (34 and 29), but I will use N=12 to maintain a stable estimate that accounts for moderate volatility (sigma). On-hand inventory is 104, and in-transit is 155. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high in-transit volume relative to the current low demand regime, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (q=0.8). I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime clearly.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand regime shift at Period 35 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~49 units (observed P35-P46).

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend for chips(Regular) shows stabilization around 49-50 units since Period 35. Comparing demand from Period 35 to the most recent Period 47 (13 samples), the mean is approximately 49.3 units with a standard deviation of about 19.3. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, with the Period 43 order arriving exactly on schedule in Period 47. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture this most recent regime accurately. This setting provides sufficient buffer (pipeline inventory) to handle the daily volatility (sigma) while keeping the base stock aligned with the lower demand mean. Current inventory (45 on-hand + 158 in-transit) is slightly high relative to the ~50 units/period demand, but given the 4-period lead time, maintaining this pipeline is necessary to prevent stockouts during demand spikes (like the 76 units seen in Period 47).

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a persistent downward trend. The most recent stable regime, identified at Period 35, shows an average demand of approximately 49-50 units. Over the last 13 periods (P35-P48), the mean demand is 48.3 units. I will use recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's behavior. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by recent arrivals (Period 44 order arrived in Period 48). I am maintaining the lead time method as 'default' (promised = 4). With on-hand inventory at 45 and in-transit at 205 (total 250), the system is well-covered for a lead time of 4 periods plus the decision period (5 total periods * ~50 demand = 250 units), though the OR backend will refine the order quantity based on these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term downward trend, transitioning through several regimes. The most recent stable regime was identified at Period 35, with an average demand of approximately 49-50 units per period. In the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49), demand recorded was 70, 37, 76, 29, 34, averaging 49.2 units, which perfectly aligns with the Carry-Over Insight from Period 47. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving 4 periods after being placed. The on-hand inventory is 50, and the in-transit pipeline is 158. Given the lead time (L=4) and a 1-period review cycle, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the recent mean of ~50 units, the required base stock targets approximately 250 units total. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime (P35-P49) while smoothing out the high variance observed in recent periods (e.g., spikes of 70-76 units and dips to 26-29 units).
