The average demand is 182 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 34. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since inventory and in-transit units are currently 0, I must order enough to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period's demand (L+1 = 5 periods). A conservative estimate for total demand over 5 periods is 182 * 5 = 910 units. However, I should account for the variance to ensure a high service level. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), I should be careful not to over-order significantly.

  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 100 units/period since Period 27, though recent demand in Periods 43-44 has dipped slightly lower (63, 61). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49 and only satisfy demand for Periods 49 and 50. Total demand to cover from Period 45 to 50 (6 periods) is estimated at 600 units (6 * 100). Current pipeline: On-hand (54) + In-transit (420) = 474 units. This leaves a gap of 126 units to cover all demand through the end of the simulation. With an order placed in P41 (100), P42 (120), P43 (100), and P44 (100) already in transit, arrivals for periods 45-48 are mostly secured. Specifically, P45 arrival (from P41) is 100, P46 (from P42) is 120, P47 (from P43) is 100, and P48 (from P44) is 100. Total stock available for P45-P50 including a new order of 130 would be 54 (on-hand) + 100 + 120 + 100 + 100 + 130 = 604 units. This closely matches the projected 6-period demand of 600 units, maintaining a slim safety stock to maximize profit while minimizing terminal holding costs.",

Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory status: On-hand (94) and In-transit (450), totaling 544 units. My pipeline covers the remaining periods of the game (P46-P50). Specifically, I have expected arrivals for: P46 (120 units ordered P42), P47 (100 units ordered P43), P48 (100 units ordered P44), P49 (130 units ordered P45), and P50 (the order I place now). Given the current on-hand stock and the 450 units in transit, the total supply of 544 units far exceeds the expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (estimated at ~350-400 units even if demand returns to the 80s). Because the game ends at Period 50, any inventory remaining after Period 50 is a pure loss due to holding costs and no future sales. Therefore, I will place a zero order to minimize further overstocking and reduce holding costs.",

With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), total projected demand is approximately 244 units (61 units * 4 periods).

With 189 units on-hand and only 3 periods of demand remaining (Period 48, 49, and 50), the expected total demand is approximately 180-195 units. Even if demand spikes slightly, we have 189 units on hand plus an in-transit pipeline of 230 units (from orders in P44 and P45) that will arrive in P48 and P49 respectively.

Furthermore, we have a significant on-hand inventory of 290 units, which is more than enough to satisfy the current demand regime (approximately 60-75 units per period) for this final step.
