Historical demand for the first 5 periods indicates an average of 182 units per period (217, 207, 170, 131, 185). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Because I start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I am facing an immediate stockout risk until the first order arrives. According to the timeline, an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 (if lead time is 4) and be usable for demand in Period 5 (since demand follows arrival), though only visible to me in the Period 6 report. To cover demand from Period 1 through Period 5 (L+1 = 5 periods), I need to account for approximately 5 * 182 = 910 units. Given high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), I will aim for a slightly higher stock level to mitigate potential stockout costs. I will place an initial order of 950 units to establish the pipeline and build safety stock.",

The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Our decision rule target is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx. 910 units). Currently, On-hand (160) + In-transit (750) = 910 units. Although the pipeline matches the target, I must account for the specific incoming schedule: our current In-transit consists of orders from P10 (200), P11 (400), P12 (100), and P13 (50). The order from P10 is expected to arrive in Period 14 (current period, visible next period). Between Period 14 and 18 (when an order placed now would arrive), we have 5 periods of demand to satisfy. Inventory calculation: OH(160) + Arriving P14-P17 (200+400+100+50=750) = 910. Total demand for 5 periods is 5 * 182 = 910. Currently, the system is perfectly balanced. I will place a maintenance order of 150 units to sustain the pipeline for the next cycle, slightly lower than mean to account for the recent lower demand trend (P11-P13 average ~153).",

To cover the remaining periods (P48-P50) without excessive overstocking at the end of Period 50, I need about 100 units per period. The order placed now (P44) will arrive in P48 resolution, just in time for P49 and P50 demand. I will order 70 units to ensure a safe buffer for the final periods while keeping ending inventory low.",

Any additional order placed now will arrive in P50 and likely contribute to ending inventory (charged holding cost) rather than sales.

Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed in Period 47 will arrive in the arrival phase of Period 51 (47 + 4 = 51), which is after the final period (Period 50). Therefore, any order placed now will incur costs without contributing to met demand or service levels within the game's duration. The current physical on-hand inventory is 149 units.

The total units available to satisfy demand through Period 50 (4 periods remaining) is 149 (on-hand) + 340 (in-transit) = 489 units. Given the current demand regime (~73 units/period), the expected total demand for the rest of the game (Periods 47, 48, 49, 50) is approximately 292 units.
