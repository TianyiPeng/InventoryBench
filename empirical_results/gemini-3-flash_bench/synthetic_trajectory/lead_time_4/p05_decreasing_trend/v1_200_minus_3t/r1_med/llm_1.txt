Calendar Assessment: Generic period labels provide no specific seasonal context, so I rely on historical demand averages. Demand Analysis: The last 14 periods show a mean demand of approximately 181 units (P1-14 avg: 185, but P9-14 avg: 171). The demand regime is stable. Lead Time Analysis: Consistent evidence from P5, P6, P7, P8, P12, P13, and P14 confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. Inventory Strategy: I must cover L+1 (5 periods) of demand. Target stock = 181 * 5 = 905 units. Current Pipeline: On-hand (268) + In-transit (760) = 1028 units. Pipeline Schedule: P11 order (190) arrives in P15 conclusion, P12 (190) in P16, P13 (190) in P17, and P14 (190) in P18. Final Order Logic: Since the existing pipeline (1028) already exceeds the safety-adjusted target (905) and the holding cost is relatively high ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I will order 0 units this period to allow the excess inventory to bleed off and avoid unnecessary holding costs.",

The promised and actual lead time remain consistent at 4 periods. With the game ending at Period 50, we must account for the 4-period lead time; an order placed now (P44) will arrive at the start of P49 (read at P49 START, available for P48 conclusion), meaning it can only satisfy demand for P49 and P50. Total remaining periods are 7 (P44-P50). Total expected pipeline required to cover P44 through P50 at a rate of 100/period is ~700 units. Current On-hand is 160. Known In-transit: P40 (100), P41 (100), P42 (100), P43 (100) = 400. Total position = 560 units. To cover expected demand of 700 units through the end of the game, we need approximately 140 more units. Ordering 140 units today will arrive during P48 and be available for P49-P50 demand. Subsequent orders (P45-P50) will arrive after the game ends and should be minimized to avoid holding costs on terminal inventory, though a small buffer is maintained for P50.",

The last 5 periods (P40-P44) show an average demand of 77.8 units, while the 15-period average (P30-P44) is 92 units. The planning mean of 105-110 units remains a safe upper bound, but recent data suggests it may be closer to 80-90 units. c) Lead Time: Consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Orders from P41, P42, P43, and P44 are in-transit (100+100+100+140 = 440 units). d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand (199) + In-transit (440) = 639 units. With only 6 periods remaining in the game (P45-P50), total expected demand at a mean of 100 units/period is ~600 units. e) Final Order Logic: The pipeline (639 units) already covers the expected demand for the remainder of the game. For Period 45: Current pipeline (639) - 1 period of demand (~100) = 539 units remaining for 5 periods. This is roughly 108 units per period, which aligns with the planning mean.

Therefore, Period 46 is the final opportunity to adjust the inventory for the final period of play. \n\n(a) Product: Chips (Regular) are a steady-demand item.

This suggests a potential new regime or a temporary dip. (c) Lead Time: Consistently 4 periods throughout the game. (d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 239. In-transit consists of orders from P42 (100), P43 (100), P44 (140), and P45 (50), totaling 390. Expected arrivals: P46: 100 (from P42), P47: 100 (from P43), P48: 140 (from P44), P49: 50 (from P45).
