Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no demand history yet, I will utilize the provided historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' (Periods 1-5: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185) to establish an initial forecast. The mean of these samples is 182, and the standard deviation is approximately 34.6. Following the (L+1) demand coverage logic, L is 4, so we need to cover 5 periods of demand. mu_hat = 5 * 182 = 910. sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 34.6 \u2248 77.37. As this is the first decision and no arrivals have been observed yet, I will use 'explicit' values derived from these samples to seed the OR backend until actual game demand is observed.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 239 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4 periods. As expected for a multi-period lead time, no units arrived in Period 1 (confirmed in the Period 1 conclude message). Demand in Period 1 was 217 units; however, since starting on-hand was 0 and nothing arrived before the demand resolution phase, 0 units were sold. The in-transit inventory is 239. The historical demand for this SKU (chips(Regular)) over the last 5 periods shows a mean of 182 units (217, 207, 170, 131, 185). Since we only have 5 samples and no clear calendar-based reason to believe a regime shift has occurred, I will use the default method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), which will calculate the forecast over all available historical samples. Lead time (L) is set to default (4 periods). This provides a base-stock level capable of covering roughly 5 periods (L+1) of demand, which the OR backend will then cap appropriately.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders placed in Periods 1 or 2 (at the start of those periods) could have arrived yet because even a lead time of 0 or 1 would only be visible starting from Period 2 or 3 'conclude' messages respectively. With L=4, we expect first arrivals in Period 5 concluding view. Current on-hand is 0, which is expected as we started with 0 and lead time hasn't elapsed. Demand so far: P1=217, P2=213, P3=170 (from provided historical samples). The mean of the first two completed periods is approx 215. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and average demand metrics from the available samples to set the base stock level. mu_hat will use the mean of all 5 available samples (182.6) multiplied by (1+L).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5 (reading Period 4 status). No arrivals have occurred yet as the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 start message. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 728 in-transit (P1: 239, P2: 244, P3: 245). Period 4 demand (131) continues a downward trend from the start (217 -> 207 -> 170 -> 131). The mean demand over 4 periods is 181. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Currently, 728 units are in transit, which covers roughly 4 periods of average demand (181 * 4 = 724). To avoid overstocking while we wait for the first arrival, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current demand mean. I will maintain the default lead time of 4 until evidence suggests otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The total in-transit quantity is 965 units across 4 pending orders. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Based on the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and no units have been sold because no stock has arrived yet. Demand has averaged 182 units over the first 4 periods. Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline inventory (965) plus current orders must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. \u03bc\u0302 = (1+4) * 182 = 910. The current in-transit (965) already exceeds my estimate of required base stock (approx 910-1000 including safety stock), so the OR backend will likely order 0 or very small amounts due to the capped policy. I will use the 'default' method for L to respect the promised lead time and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the early mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3301.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Reviewing history: Promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (239 units) arrived in Period 5 (arrived=239, lead_time was 4 periods), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand samples (P1-P5) are: 217, 213, 163, 181, 177. Mean demand = 190.2, Std Dev = 23.3. Currently, On-hand = 62. In-transit = 244(P2) + 245(P3) + 237(P4) + 78(P5) = 804. Since the P1 order arrived exactly on time, we expect P2 (244 units) to arrive in Period 6 arrival resolution. The pipeline is healthy. I will use the default lead time (4) and average of all 5 samples for demand and volatility to stabilize the base stock calculation, as no clear regime shift is observed beyond initial noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3554.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Demand over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with values ranging from 163 to 217 (Average: 190.67, Std Dev: 20.3). Lead time has been confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving at the start of P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 113. Total units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6) sum to 728 units (245+237+78+168). For the OR backend, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stable demand regime observed so far. Since the confirmed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4, I will use the 'default' method for L. The backend will calculate base_stock = (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L), which for L=4 means covering 5 periods of demand. This approach balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a safe inventory buffer.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P5, P6, P7 conclude messages) confirms actual lead time L=4. Demand for the last 7 periods (217, 213, 163, 181, 177, 193, 202) shows a mean of approximately 192.2 and a standard deviation of 18.9. There is no clear seasonal or calendar-driven change detected yet, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full recent demand profile. Setting L to 'default' (which is the promised 4) or 'recent_N' (observed 4) are both valid; I will choose 'calculate' to reflect the observed consistent L. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost (q=0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3247.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Analysis of past arrival data (Period 5-8) consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand across the first 8 periods has remained relatively stable, with values ranging from 163 to 217. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (Period 4 to Period 8) is 187.0 units, which is consistent with the overall average of approximately 191 units. Since there are no observed shifts in lead time or demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand and L=4. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover demand over (L+1)=5 periods. The current on-hand inventory (211) and in-transit (642) are high because orders from Periods 5-8 are still in segments of the pipeline, so the capped policy will naturally moderate the new order size.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2871.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time (Confirmed arrivals: P5, P6, P7, P8, P9 all show lead_time=4). Demand remains stable with a slight downward trend in the most recent periods (P8: 182, P9: 158). The on-hand inventory is 131, which is below one period's average demand (~185). However, there are 684 units in-transit, which includes orders from P6 (ordered 168), P7 (191), P8 (205), and P9 (120). These are expected to arrive in P10, P11, P12, and P13 respectively. Because the pipeline is full and the demand looks stable, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent level (avg ~182) while sticking with the confirmed lead time of 4. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level that covers 5 periods (L+1) without over-ordering due to the high pipeline inventory. The service level target (q) is high (~95%) given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, which the backend will handle automatically.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 111 units on-hand and 675 units in-transit. Looking at the history, every order from Period 1 through Period 6 has arrived exactly 4 periods later (L=4). Demand has been relatively stable across the 10 periods, with mean demand ~187.2 and standard deviation ~16.5. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes visible in the first 10 data points; demand fluctuates within a consistent range. Since L=4 is now confirmed by 6 consecutive arrivals, I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time. For demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent stable history while allowing for future responsiveness if patterns shift.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P7). Current inventory logic: On-hand is 116, and In-transit is 704. Our 'In-transit' includes orders from P8 (205), P9 (120), P10 (159), and P11 (220), totaling 704. The P8 order (205 units) is expected to arrive during Period 12 and will be visible in the next period's start. Demand has been relatively stable over the last 11 periods, ranging between 158 and 217. The mean demand is approximately 187 units per period. Since there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal spikes in the provided data (Period 1 to 11), using 'default' for L (promised = 4) and 'default' for mu_hat/sigma_hat is appropriate to capture the full historical distribution while the pipeline is full and lead times are stable.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed from Period 1 to Period 8 deliveries). Total in-transit inventory is 693 units, consisting of orders from P9 (120), P10 (159), P11 (220), and P12 (194). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable throughout the 12-period history, with a mean of approximately 183 units per period. No clear seasonal shifting or calendar-based volatility is evident in the Period_1-Period_12 data. Therefore, I will use a 12-period window (all available historical data) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Setting L to the promised (and observed) 4 periods ensures the inventory position covers (4+1)=5 periods of demand. This approach maintains a high service level while managing holding costs effectively given the steady demand pattern.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the first 13 periods, with a mean of approximately 184 units and no significant trend or seasonal shifts detected. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 4 periods (as evidenced by P1-P9 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). Since the demand regime is stable, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the full recent history. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the review period plus lead time (1+4=5 periods) using the most comprehensive stable sample set available. The service level target is high (~95%) given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 181.7 units across all 14 periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. In-transit inventory (725 units) consists of orders from Periods 11 (220), 12 (194), 13 (141), and 14 (170), which are scheduled to arrive from Period 15 through Period 18 based on the stable lead time of 4. Since the demand is stable and lead times have not drifted, I will use 'default' for L (promised 4), and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (the full historical range of observed demand) to capture the most accurate current distribution statistics.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with an average demand of approximately 180 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every order since Period 5 (P1 through P11 arrivals). Currently, we have 161 units on-hand and 660 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). Given the stability in both lead time (L=4) and demand, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations and 'recent_N' with N=15 for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the overall stability of the current regime while allowing the engine to filter out the very early initialization periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 16 periods. The mean demand across all periods is approximately 177 units, and the standard deviation is around 22 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised and observed in every successful delivery. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 230 units, with 622 units in-transit (reflecting orders from periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). Since the demand shows no significant regime shifts or seasonal spikes in the provided window, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the slightly lower demand seen in the last few periods (averaging ~160) to avoid building excessive safety stock, while keeping lead time at the default promised value of 4.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend over the last 5 periods (Periods 13-17 averages ~140 units/period, compared to the overall average of ~178). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent lower demand level. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the 'conclude' messages from P5 to P17), which matches the promised lead time. Therefore, I will use 'default' for L. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current reduced volatility in demand, ensuring the base stock calculation is responsive to the most recent behavior.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend over the last 3 periods (average 131 units) compared to the overall historical average of 177 units. Lead time is consistently holding at the promised 4 periods (arrived shipments from P10-P14 confirm this). Currently, there is 272 units on-hand and 422 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). The sum of on-hand and pipeline is 694. Given L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it captures the recent lower demand trend (avg 153 over last 10 periods) while maintaining enough buffer for variance. This prevents overstocking while demand softens.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward shift in the most recent 5 periods (mean ~145) compared to the overall history (mean ~175). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as previously confirmed. Current on-hand inventory is 255 with 448 in-transit (orders from P16, P17, P18, P19). To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime. This will recalibrate the base stock to the more recent consumption pattern while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: average demand decreased from ~180 to ~145 (-19.4%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3229.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level since Period 16. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 16 to 20 is (125+124+145+172+182)/5 = 149.6, compared to the earlier average of ~180. The promised lead time of 4 is consistently confirmed by the arrival history. I will use N=5 for the recent demand regime (Period 16-20) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend adapts to this lower consumption rate while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1). Pipeline inventory (398 units) and on-hand (229 units) are currently sufficient to cover expected lead-time demand, so the OR backend will likely moderate order sizes to avoid excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2933.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a previous period of volatility. Comparing the initial periods (P1-P15 avg: ~181) with the most recent periods (P16-P21 avg: ~151), there is a confirmed lower-demand regime. The carry-over insight noted a drop to ~145, but recent samples (P19-P21) show a slight uptick (172, 182, 162). I will use a window of the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this new regime starting from Period 16, which yields a mean of ~151. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. Pipeline inventory (514) plus on-hand (145) totals 659 units. With an lead time of 4, our 'coverage period' is (L+1)=5. The OR engine will aim for a base stock around 5 * 151 = 755 plus safety stock. Keeping N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the model to react to the lower demand while acknowledging the slight recent increases.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to 22, the average is 146.0 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~180. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages (P17 arrived P21, P18 arrived P22). With 66 units on-hand and 670 units in-transit (orders from P19, P20, P21, P22), the pipeline is well-stocked. We use N=7 for the recent demand regime (P16-P22) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which accurately captures the current lower mean and slightly higher variance observed in recent periods (ranging from 112 to 182). L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P16) has shown an average demand of approximately 150 units per period, consistently lower than the historical average of 180+. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With a lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent 8 samples (P16-P23) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat more accurately reflects the current lower-demand environment. Current on-hand (117) and in-transit (582) totals 699, which is approximately 4.6 periods of demand at the new average, suggesting we are close to the desired base stock level. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and reduced variance.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease starting around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to 24, the average demand is approximately 140 units (125, 124, 145, 172, 182, 162, 112, 130, 108), which is significantly lower than the ~185 average observed in Periods 1-15. This confirms the regime shift noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Period 24 for the Period 20 order). To manage the OR backend effectively, I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods (Period 16-24) to capture this lower demand mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects the current market reality rather than the historically higher demand. The pipeline inventory (591 units) is quite high relative to this new demand level, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in smaller orders until the excess is cleared, minimizing holding costs.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime. Since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 144 units per period (Sample mean P16-P25: 148.5), compared to the earlier average of ~180. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 144 and in-transit at 490 (total pipeline 634), and an expected demand over the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5) of roughly 740 units, the system is slightly under-provisioned relative to the target service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to recent volatility (Range 108-182). I will stick with the 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period duration is very stable.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26 (11 samples), the average demand is approximately 139.7 units per period, which is a significant drop from the pre-Period 16 average of ~180 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture this established lower-demand state. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages (P22 order arrived P26, lead time 4). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 221 units, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 477 units, providing adequate coverage. By using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target that reflects current lower consumption and volatility levels, avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for a 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift sustained through Period 26: avg demand approx 140 (compared to historical 180). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is approximately 134.6, which is significantly lower than the historical average of 180 observed in the first 15 periods. The most recent demand (P27) was unusually low at 79, but I will maintain a consistent forecast based on the recent regime (last 12 periods) to avoid over-reacting to a single data point. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 235 and in-transit at 483, the total pipeline is 718. Using recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to adjust to this confirmed lower demand volume while maintaining an appropriate safety stock for the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1450.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease since Period 16, specifically dropping from an average of ~180 to approximately 140. Looking at the most recent periods (P27 and P28), demand has dipped even lower (79 and 90), suggesting a potential further softening or high volatility at this lower level. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (260) plus in-transit stock (437) totals 697 units. Given the lower demand regime (~140/period) and the 4-period lead time, we need to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand, roughly 700 units. Since current total inventory is close to this target and holding costs are being incurred, I will use recent_N (N=13, covering the start of the shift at P16) to accurately capture the current lower mean and variance, ensuring the backend adjusts the base stock down to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining the target service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1427.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift. From Period 1-15, the average demand was approximately 183 units. Starting from Period 16, demand has declined consistently, with the last 5 periods (P25-P29) averaging only 107 units, and the last 3 periods (P27-P29) averaging 86 units. This indicates a sustained lower demand regime compared to the early-game average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (264) and substantial in-transit stock (421), including arrivals from orders in Periods 26-29, the primary goal is to prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=14 to capture the shift that began around Period 16, while still maintaining some buffer for volatility. L is set to calculate as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand decline confirmed: Average demand from Period 27-29 dropped to ~86 units, significantly lower than the Period 16-26 average of ~140.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2540.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct downward shifts. Period 30 recorded a demand of 149, which is higher than the previous three periods (79, 90, 89) but still consistent with the broader downward trend identified since Period 16. The average demand from Period 27 to 30 is approximately 101.75 units, significantly lower than the ~180 units at the start and the ~140 units in the middle regime. I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering Periods 26-30) to capture this lower volume and higher volatility (ranging from 79 to 149) while avoiding over-stocking given the current high inventory (On-hand: 291, In-transit: 322). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, which is reflected in every recent arrival confirmation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in the low-demand regime: Period 27-30 demand range [79, 149] compared to earlier stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1770.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct downward shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 27, where the average demand dropped significantly. For the last 5 periods (P27-P31), the demand has averaged approximately 103 units (79, 90, 89, 149, 108), compared to the previous regime of ~140. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). With the current inventory (On-hand: 282, In-transit: 232) totaling 514 units, we are significantly overstocked relative to the new demand level (roughly 5 periods of supply). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this lower demand regime and allow the inventory to bleed down naturally to prevent excessive holding costs. No order is likely to be triggered by the OR engine given the high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 3 confirmed starting Period 27: Average demand decreased to ~103 (from ~140 in P16-26).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a third regime starting around Period 27. Looking at the last 6 periods (P27-P32), demand values are [79, 90, 89, 149, 108, 89], resulting in an average of approximately 100.6 units per period. This is a significant drop from the previous regime (P16-P26) which averaged ~140. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P28 order in P32. With an on-hand inventory of 262 and in-transit inventory of 267 (total pipeline = 529), we are currently well-stocked for the current demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this newest demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock level downwards, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining the required service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2081.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-demand regime (Regime 3) which began around Period 27. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P27-P33), the average demand is approximately 103.5 units (79, 90, 89, 149, 108, 89, 121), showing both lower volume and increased volatility compared to the early-game stability. Currently, we have 218 units on-hand and 259 in-transit. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, the total inventory pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 477 units. This pipeline must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~103.5, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 517.5 units. The current pipeline is slightly below this target, justifying the continued ordering by the OR system. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and higher variance accurately, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $19 profit / $1 holding cost ratio (~95% service level).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a third, lower-demand regime starting around Period 27. The average demand for the last 8 periods (P27-P34) is 104.1 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.9 units. This represents a significant drop from the previous regime's average of ~140. Lead times have remained consistently stable at 4 periods (P27-P30 orders arrived exactly after 4 periods). With the current on-hand inventory (197) and high in-transit stock (313), the pipeline is well-saturated relative to the current low-demand trend. I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this specific low-demand regime for both mean and standard deviation to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining the required service level defined by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 3 (starting Period 27) verified: Period 27-34 average demand is 104.1 units, significantly lower than the P16-26 average of 140.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a third regime starting around Period 27. The average demand for this period (P27-P35) is 101.8 units, which is significantly lower than the previous averages of ~140 (P16-26) and ~180 (P1-15). Recent volatility has also stabilized somewhat after a spike in Period 30. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. With 123 units on hand and 393 units in transit (covering orders for P32-P35), we are well-positioned for the upcoming lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture only the current low-demand regime (P27-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current market behavior rather than historical highs.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a third regime starting around Period 27. Analyzing demand from Period 27 to Period 36, the average demand is approximately 102.8 units per period (samples: 79, 90, 89, 149, 108, 89, 121, 98, 83, 113). This is a significant drop from the initial ~180 and the secondary ~140 regimes. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages (P32-P36 arrivals all show lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is 114, with 359 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36). To align with this current low-demand regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to reflect the mean of ~103 and the relevant volatility. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 matches observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 3 (starting Period 27) remains stable through Period 36 with an average of ~103 units per period. Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a third regime starting around Period 27. From Period 27 to Period 37, the average demand is approximately 102.7 units per period. The standard deviation in this relative stable but lower-demand period is roughly 20.2. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 82 and in-transit inventory at 406 (total pipeline = 488), the current stock levels are well-positioned to meet the forecasted demand of (1+L)*mu = 5 * 102.7 = 513.5. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the properties of this current demand regime (P27-P37) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for lead time since it remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1167.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in its third regime, which began around Period 27. From Period 27 to Period 38, the average demand is approximately 100 units (mean=99.8, range 69-149). The current on-hand inventory is 144 units, and there are 371 units in transit, which is quite high relative to the current demand levels (expected consumption over L+1 periods is roughly 500 units, and we have 515 units total). Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods across all observed arrivals. To align with this lower demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=12 (covering Periods 27-38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will help the OR backend adjust the inventory targets downward, avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining a safe service level for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 3 (starting Period 27) remains stable through Period 38 with an average of approximately 100 units per period (12-period average: 99.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1987.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a third regime starting around Period 27. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 39 is approximately 100.6 units per period (13 samples). The recent demand in Period 39 was 111, following 69 in Period 38 and 101 in Period 37. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. To respond to this current regime, I will use a window of 13 periods (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this lower-demand state accurately. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the ~100 unit/period average while accounting for the observed volatility in this range (approx 70-150). With 122 units on hand and 342 in-transit (orders from P36, P37, P38, and P39), the system is well-covered for the next several periods given the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $888.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime (Regime 3) starting from Period 27. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 40 is approximately 99.5 units per period. The most recent demand in Period 40 was 54, while Period 39 was 111, showing continued volatility within this low-demand state. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (Period 40's arrival was ordered in Period 36, L=4). To set parameters for the OR backend, I am using a recent_N window of 14 periods for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full scope of Regime 3 (P27-P40). This allows the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 = 5 periods of demand) to align with current behavior, preventing overstocking as we enter the final 10 periods of the game. Pipeline inventory is currently high (385 units) relative to recent demand, so the capped policy will likely reduce the order size to manage holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 3 (starting Period 27) remains stable through Period 40 with an average of approximately 100 units (14-period average: 99.5). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a third regime starting at Period 27, with an average of approximately 99.5 units per period and moderate volatility. In the most recent periods (P35-P41), demand has been 83, 113, 101, 69, 111, 54, and 110. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire game history. Current inventory (on-hand 144 + in-transit 317 = 461) is sufficient to cover approximately 4.6 periods of the current average demand (~100 units). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this third regime (which is 15 periods long from P27 to P41) while ignoring the higher-demand periods of the past. This ensures the base stock reflects current consumption levels (approx 500 units for the protection interval).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in Regime 3 (starting Period 27) with an average demand of approximately 100 units per period. The 16-period average from Period 27 to 42 is 100.8, with recent volatility (sigma) showing a standard deviation of approximately 22 units within this period range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (including the most recent arriving on Period 42 with a 4-period lead time). Based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the service level q is 0.95. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the entirety of Regime 3, providing the OR backend with the most relevant local mean and volatility. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 3 (starting Period 27) remains stable through Period 42: average demand is 100.8 units (16-period average).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a third regime starting around Period 27. The average demand for the last 17 periods (P27-P43) is approximately 98.6 units, which is significantly lower than previous regimes but very consistent. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods, with every order from Period 1 through Period 39 arriving exactly on the 4th period later. Given this stability, I will use a 17-period lookback (N=17) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this specific regime perfectly while ignoring the older higher-demand data. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects current consumption levels (around 100 units/period) and ensures the pipeline (current period + 4-period lead time) is adequately covered without excessive holding costs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into its third regime, which began around Period 27. Demand in this latest phase has consistently averaged approximately 93-100 units per period. Specifically, from Period 27 to 44, the average demand is 96.1 units. In the most recent four periods (P41-P44), demand has been slightly lower (avg 83.75), but given the historical floor around 60-100 units, I will use a window of the last 18 periods (N=18) to capture the entirety of Regime 3 for mu_hat. This provides a stable estimate of ~96 units/period (total 480 for L+1). Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=18 window to capture recent volatility. The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. Inventory levels (On-hand: 188, In-transit: 315) are healthy relative to the expected demand of roughly 100 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime 3 (starting Period 27) remains stable through Period 44: average demand is 96.1 units (18-period average). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower and more volatile regime since Period 27, with the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45) showing an even sharper decline to an average of approximately 83.3 units per period. The 19th-period average for this broader low-demand regime (P27-P45) is approximately 94 units. Given that the game ends at Period 50 and lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand trend (last 10 periods) to avoid overstocking at the end of the game, while using secondary recent demand data (last 19 periods) for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime 3: Period 36-45 average demand has further decreased to 83.3 units, compared to the P27-35 average of 104 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $932.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime (Regime 3). Recent observations from Period 36 to 46 show a more pronounced decline, with an average demand of approximately 83 units compared to the earlier Period 27-35 average of 104 units. To reflect this recent trend, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the Period 36-46 window. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 227 and in-transit at 224, the pipeline is relatively full compared to the current demand levels, so the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime 3: Period 36-46 average demand has further decreased to 82.1 units (11-period average), down from the P27-35 average of 104 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $954.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime. Since Period 36, the average demand is approximately 80.5 units per period (Periods 36-47), which is a significant drop from the previous regime's average of ~104. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the most recent 12-period window (N=12) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current low-demand stability while filtering out earlier, higher demand. Given the current high on-hand inventory (262 units) and in-transit inventory (175 units), total pipeline inventory is 437 units. At an average requirement of ~80/period, this covers over 5 periods, so minimal ordering is expected from the OR backend. Using recent_N with N=12 for both demand and volatility provides a responsive but stable forecast for this final stretch of the game.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed refined demand regime 3 (starting P36): Average demand is 80.5 units (12-period average P36-P47), significantly lower than previous regimes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1182.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) will arrive in Period 53 (49+4), which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the objective is to set parameters that represent the current demand regime. A sustained demand shift (Regime 3, refined) has been observed since Period 36. For the last 13 periods (P36-P48), demand has averaged 80.1 units with relatively low volatility. Using recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat captures this specific regime effectively. For sigma_hat, N=13 reflects the current volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime 3 (starting P36) confirmed through P48: 13-period average demand is 80.1 units (range 54-113), significantly lower than previous regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $783.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime (Regime 3, refined from Period 36 onwards). Over the last 14 periods (P36-P49), the average demand is 78.2 units, significantly lower than previous periods. The most recent 5 periods (P45-P49) show an even lower average of 62.8 units, suggesting a potential further softening or volatility at the low end. Currently, on-hand inventory (243) plus in-transit stock (189) totals 432 units. With a demand forecast of ~78 units per period and a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover 5 periods (L+1), which equates to approximately 390 units. Since current pipeline inventory (432) already exceeds this coverage, the system will naturally order zero or very minimal amounts to bleed off excess inventory and minimize holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture this most recent sustained lower demand regime, and sigma_hat using the same N to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime 3 (starting P36) confirmed through P49: 14-period average demand is 78.2 units (range 54-113). Recent 5-period average (P45-P49) is 62.8 units.
