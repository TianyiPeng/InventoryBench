Based on the provided historical demand for the first 5 periods (217, 207, 170, 131, 185), the average demand is approximately 182 units per period with significant variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. I must cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 with my current on-hand inventory (0) and any existing pipeline (0). Since I have zero stock and the first 5 periods of demand will likely deplete any early arrivals, I need to place a substantial order immediately to establish a pipeline. Given the lead time (L=4), I need to cover L+1 periods (Periods 1-5). Calculating for a target of ~185 units/period for 5 periods equals 925 units. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order a total of 925 units to ensure I minimize stockouts once deliveries begin, while acknowledging that Periods 1-4 will inevitably have lost sales due to zero starting inventory and the 4-period lead time.",

Using a conservative estimate of 100 units/period (reflecting the higher end of the recent regime to avoid stockouts), the required total pipeline is ~500 units. Current On-hand is 92, and In-transit is 385 (Orders from P40: 105, P41: 80, P42: 100, P43: 100), totaling 477 units. To reach the 500-unit target and maintain a small safety buffer against the volatility (like the P41 demand of 110), I will place an order of 100 units. This ensures that even with the lower demand, we are not over-ordering to the point of excessive holding costs as the game approaches its end at Period 50.",

Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 136 units on-hand and 380 units in-transit, there is enough stock to cover approximately 6.5 periods of demand at the current average, or 4-5 periods if demand spikes back toward 100. The Game ends at Period 50. Total inventory position is 516 (136 on-hand + 380 in-transit). Expected total demand for the remaining periods (P45-P50) is approximately 480-550 units depending on volatility.

This 4-period average is approx 71 units, confirming the carry-over insight that demand is now consistently below the previous 100-unit mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory consists of four orders of 100 units each (placed P42-P45), totaling 400 units. My current on-hand inventory is 156 units. With lead time L=4, my decision must cover demand for the next L+1 = 5 periods. Using a conservative forecast of ~80 units/period (slightly higher than the recent average to maintain a safety buffer), total coverage needed is 400 units. Since current on-hand + in-transit is 556 units, I have a significant surplus (approximately 2 periods of extra stock beyond the lead time horizon). Given the game ends at Period 50, further orders would arrive in the final periods or after the game concludes. Therefore, I will halt ordering to minimize holding costs and allow inventory to burn down towards the end of the simulation.",

Given the current demand (approx. 70 units/period), the existing on-hand inventory plus the incoming 300 units (totaling 495 units) is far more than enough to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand (approx. 280 units).
