Following the lead time of 4, the P6 order (109) should arrive in P10 conclusion (usable for P11), and P7 (138) should arrive in P11 (usable for P12). 3. Gap Analysis: We are currently stocked out (Ending Inventory P9 = 0). Demand in P10 will likely be ~100 units, but no stock is available until the P6 shipment arrives during the resolution phase of P10. 4. Strategic Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 30 units.

The earlier history (P1-P8) averaged around 98.6. Demand is generally stable around a mean of 95-100.\n\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 130. Pipeline is 211. Total coverage (on-hand + pipeline) = 341. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for R+L = 5 periods. With a mean demand of ~100, we need approximately 500 units in the system to maintain a high service level.\n\n4. **OR Baseline & Adjustment**: The OR recommendation (136 units) targets a total system level of 347 (211 in-transit + 136 order). However, the OR calculation is capped and likely conservative regarding the inventory cushion needed for a lead-time of 4. Given that the current inventory position of 341 only covers about 3.5 periods of demand, and we need to cover 5 periods (P13, P14, P15, P16, P17), the current pipeline is insufficient. \n\nTargeting a base stock level for 5 periods: 100 * 5 + safety stock (~70) = 570. \nSubtracting current pipeline (211) and current on-hand (130) = 229 units. \nThe OR recommendation of 136 is too low because it doesn't account for the fact that we've had periods of stockouts (P1-P4 and P9) and a 1:1 holding-to-profit ratio suggests a balanced risk approach.

The average demand over the last 12 periods (P17-P28) is approximately 64 units, compared to the initial historical mean of ~100.

Expected demand over 5 periods based on the current regime (64 units/period) is 320 units. \n5. **OR Reconciliation**: The OR algorithm recommends 132 units. However, it uses historical data (including the high-demand early periods) and assumes a higher mean demand and variance. Adding 132 units to our current 283 would bring total inventory to 415, which is roughly 6.5 periods of stock at the current regime. This would lead to excessive holding costs ($1/unit).\n6. **Decision**: With 283 units already in the system and a 5-period requirement of ~320 units, we are only slightly under the target.

The order from Period 17 (0 units) also passed without issue. Current demand is in a lower regime; since Period 17, the average demand is approximately 63 units, which is a significant decrease from the early game (~100). The current inventory state: On-hand = 53, In-transit = 215 (orders from P32: 50, P33: 65, P34: 55, P35: 45). Total pipeline + on-hand = 268 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. At an average demand of 63, the required base stock is roughly 315-350 units. The OR recommendation is 122 units, which targets a higher historical mean. If I order 122, total inventory becomes 390. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning safety stock should be minimal. I will reduce the OR recommendation to 80 units to better align with the 63-unit demand average while preventing excessive holding costs, as total coverage will then be 348 units (approx 5.5 periods of demand).",

The pipeline (in-transit) is 470 units. These arrivals are scheduled as follows: P42 order (130 units) in P46, P43 order (100 units) in P47, P44 order (120 units) in P48, and P45 order (120 units) in P49. 3. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift was noted in Period 39 where demand increased to ~110 units. Recent periods (P41-P45) show a mean demand of 123.8 units (180, 89, 162, 75, 113). 4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR agent recommends 0 units. This is because the pipeline inventory (470) plus on-hand (12) equals 482 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current high rate (~120/period). 5. **Ending Game Strategy**: Since we are in Period 46 and the lead time is 4 periods, an order placed now would arrive in Period 50 (the final period). Given that we already have 470 units coming in over the next 4 periods and only 5 periods remaining in the simulation, any additional order would likely result in excessive holding costs at the end of the game or arrive too late to satisfy demand.

Inventory Strategy: On-hand is 0. We need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Total demand for 5 periods @ 118/period \u2248 590 units. Total coverage needed (590) - Pipeline (360) = 230 units.

Orders placed in P45, P46, P47, and P48 are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in P49, P50, P51, and P52 respectively.\n2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Following the sequence, the P45 order (120 units) arrives DURING P49 (after the decision), meaning P49 demand must be met by that arrival. Total in-transit is 316 (P45=120, P46=0, P47=120, P48=76). \n3. **Demand Analysis**: A demand regime shift occurred at P36. Over the last 13 periods (P36-P48), the average demand is 114.3 units. Recent demand is stable around 110-125 units. \n4. **Order Calculation**: The game ends at Period 50. This order (P49) with a 4-period lead time would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game horizon. However, the goal is to maximize total reward, and inventory after P50 doesn't generate profit. \n5. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 123 units based on the total history, which aligns well with the current high-demand regime (~115 units). \n6. **Final Strategy**: Since this order arrives after the game ends, any quantity ordered now will only incur potential costs or simply exist in-transit without affecting the P50 ending state. However, to maintain the strategy of covering demand and following the OR baseline which accounts for safety stocks, I will place the order. Since P46 was a 0-order, there is a gap in the pipeline for P50 arrivals. The arrival sequence is: P49 gets 120 units (ordered P45), P50 gets 0 units (ordered P46). P50 demand (~115) will have to be satisfied by the leftover from P49. P49 demand is ~115, so 120 - 115 = 5 units left for P50. This creates a massive stockout in P50. Unfortunately, an order placed now (P49) cannot fix the P50 stockout due to the 4-period lead time.",
