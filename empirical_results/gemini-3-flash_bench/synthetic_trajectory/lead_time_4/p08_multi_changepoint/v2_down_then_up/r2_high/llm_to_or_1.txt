Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. I have 5 days of historical demand data for 'chips(Regular)'. The demand values are 95, 113, 106, 84, and 71. The mean is 93.8 and the standard deviation is 16.9. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since I have no observed lead times yet and only 5 data points, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level (target pipeline inventory). The OR backend uses mu_hat and sigma_hat as coverage for (1+L) periods. Calculation: 1+L = 5. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~469. The stock-out risk is managed by the OR engine using the Profit and Holding Cost to determine the service level. No evidence of demand shifts or lead time changes yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 122 units, which is currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this arrival until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we missed all 56 units of demand in Period 1 because arrivals occur after the decision and demand resolution phases. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 93.8 over the first 5 provided samples, but the actual demand in Period 1 was 56. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. For now, I will use the default methods as we lack enough 'concluded' lead-time data to justify an explicit shift from the promised L=4 or the default demand statistics.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. The 'Period 1 conclude' and 'Period 2 conclude' messages correctly show 0 arrivals, as it is too early for any shipments to have arrived. Consequently, we have had 0 sales because on-hand inventory has been 0, resulting in lost demand (56 in P1 and 98 in P2). The total in-transit quantity is 245 (122 from P1 + 123 from P2). Historical demand samples are [95, 113, 106, 84, 71], while the actual demand observed in P1 and P2 was 56 and 98 respectively. Given the limited observation window and no evidence yet of lead time deviation, I will use the default promised lead time and utilize the most recent 3 demand samples (including the actual demand from P1 and P2) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances the initial seed data with the actual realized demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time delay or lost shipment. Demand for the last three periods has been 56, 98, and 137, showing a significant upward trend (average ~97). Since we have no on-hand inventory and the first arrival isn't expected until Period 5, our goal is to ensure the pipeline covers the upcoming demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this recent demand growth, and set L to 'default' (4) as no evidence yet suggests the lead time differs from the promise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, according to the lead time definition, it should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. This explains why we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units despite demand. Total in-transit is 520 units (sum of orders from P1 to P4: 122+123+111+164). Historical demand samples for P1-P5 are [95, 113, 106, 84, 71] (Note: the 'Game History' demand differs slightly from the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt; I will prioritize the provided data samples for statistical calculations). Mean demand is approx 93.8. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Currently, the system carries no stock, so we must maintain the pipeline. I will use 'default' for L as no orders have concluded yet to prove a shift. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the initial demand distribution for the base-stock calculation.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived exactly as promised in Period 5 (L=4). There are no reported lost shipments yet. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71 (from the sample data) or 56, 98, 137, 82, 111 (from the game history). Using the game history data, the mean is approximately 96.8. Since we are in the early stages and variability is present, I will use a recent_N of 5 for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the initial regime. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 437) plus on-hand (11) is 448. The base stock calculation for L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand) with mu ~ 97 would be roughly 485, so the backend should trigger a small order to maintain the service level across the lead time buffer.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2546.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 6 demand (167) exceeded the total available stock (134 units: 11 carry-over + 123 arrived). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of orders from Period 1 (arrived P5) and Period 2 (arrived P6). Historical demand samples are [95, 113, 106, 84, 71, 56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167]. The target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95. Since we just ran out of stock and demand appears to have surged in Period 6 (167 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this shift. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 461) includes orders from P3(111), P4(164), P5(39), and P6(147). With L=4, we are ordering for demand coverage across 5 periods (L+1).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been: 56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167, 135. The average demand is approximately 112 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and concluded arrivals (P5, P6, P7) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have significant stockouts in P6 and P7 due to high demand (167 and 135) exceeding recent arrivals. There are 525 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). With L=4, the base stock targets demand for 1+L=5 periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level and volatility while accounting for the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms a stable actual lead time (L) of 4 periods (P5 shows P1 arrival, P6 shows P2 arrival, P7 shows P3 arrival, P8 shows P4 arrival). Demand history shows initial samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) followed by realized demand in Periods 1-8 (56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167, 135, 128). The mean demand over all available samples (13 points) is approximately 106.7. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 167, 135, 128) is significantly higher, averaging 143.3. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using N=8 for mu_hat captured since Period 1 to average out the high volatility and recent upward trend, resulting in a more robust forecast than the total average. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical variance across all samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Global demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to 9 is: 56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167, 135, 128, 106. The mean of these 9 samples is ~113.4. Combined with the initial seed data provided (95, 113, 106, 84, 71), the average remains around 106-110. Inventory has been frequently hitting zero, resulting in lost sales (e.g., P6, P7, P9), which indicates the demand is consistently outpacing our arrival batches because of the 4-period lead time delay and insufficient buffer. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Profit is $19 and Holding is $1, leading to a high target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), suggesting we should set parameters to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full observed demand history during the game while ignoring the seed data which seemed slightly lower. This will help the backend establish a more robust base stock level.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 decision context: The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by deliveries from orders 1 through 6 arriving exactly on schedule). Current inventory status is 33 units on-hand with 541 units in-transit. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 113.4 units, though it has fluctuated between 56 and 167. Looking at the demand pattern, there is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet, but the last 5 periods (P6-P10) have averaged 130, which is higher than the initial samples. I will set L to 'default' (4) as the actual lead time matches the promised one. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the demand stabilization after the initial noisy startup periods (P4-P10), effectively forecasting for 5 periods (L+1). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect current volatility.

The demand history (Periods 1-11) shows values: 56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167, 135, 128, 106, 114, 108. The mean demand over these 11 periods is approximately 112.9, and the standard deviation is approximately 28.5. Looking at the last 6 periods (P6-P11), the demand seems relatively stable (avg \u2248 126), though slightly higher than the start. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this slightly higher demand levels to avoid stockouts, as the stockout risk (Profit $19 vs Holding $1) favors a higher service level. L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current inventory position for chips(Regular) includes 153 units on-hand and 443 units in-transit. Looking at the arrival history, every single order from Period 1 to Period 8 has arrived exactly 4 periods later (arrived=122 in P5, 123 in P6, 111 in P7, 164 in P8, 39 in P9, 147 in P10, 175 in P11, and 174 in P12). This confirms the promised lead time of 4 periods is perfectly stable. For demand, the historical samples provided (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) and the observed game history (56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167, 135, 128, 106, 114, 108, 121) show some volatility but no clear structural regime shift or seasonal spike. The mean demand over the 12 game periods is approximately 113.58. Since there is no clear trend or changepoint, using 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat (which uses the full history) is mathematically robust. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for L+1 periods (5 periods) while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), ensuring a high service level.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Historical demand analysis (P1-P13) shows a stable mean. The last 5 periods (P9-P13) have mean demand of 103.4, while the full history mean is 110. No significant demand regime shifts or seasonality are detected from the generic period labels. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed in arrivals for orders from P1 through P9). On-hand inventory is 197, and in-transit inventory is 372 (orders from P10-P13: 80+127+124+41=372). Total pipeline inventory is 569. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR engine will target a high service level. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 (covering P5-P13) stabilizes the forecast against initial startup noise while reflecting the current stable demand of approx 110 units per period. sigma_hat is set to default to capture full historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 105.7 units per period based on the last 15 periods of data (excluding the low initial period). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every order that has arrived so far (Periods 1 through 10 orders). At the start of Period 15, on-hand inventory is 171 units and units in-transit total 412 (orders from Period 11, 12, 13, and 14). Since lead time is stable at 4, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most stable recent demand regime (approximate mean ~106, std ~25). This covers the total lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods) of demand. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level, which is appropriate given the 171 units on hand compared to the 412 units currently in the pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by historical arrivals (Periods 5-15). Demand has been relatively stable, with a slight downward trend in the most recent periods (Periods 13-15 showing 68, 106, 81). Given the product 'chips (Regular)', demand is generally non-seasonal unless specific dates are provided. The current On-hand inventory (217) and In-transit (377) total 594 units. With an average demand of approximately 107 units per period (based on the last 15 periods), the total pipeline covers roughly 5.5 periods, which is appropriate for a lead time of 4. To better capture the recent variability and the slight drop in demand, I am using recent_N=10 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering based on the higher demand seen in Periods 6-8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a downward trend over the last few periods (106, 81, 38). Specifically, the demand in Period 16 (38) is significantly lower than the long-term average (approx. 100). This suggests a possible regime shift or a temporary lull. Given the high on-hand inventory (303) and 328 units in transit (expected from orders in P13, P14, P15, and P16), we are currently overstocked relative to current demand. The lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the softening market, while keeping L at default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~120 to ~80 (periods 13-16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $896.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all historical arrivals (Periods 5 through 17). Demand shows a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. Prior to Period 13, demand averaged approximately 110-120 units. Since Period 13, demand has dropped consistently: P13=68, P14=106, P15=81, P16=38, P17=62. The average for these last 5 periods is 71 units, compared to the initial sample data average of 93.8. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 282, In-transit: 287) relative to this lower demand, leading to high holding costs. To optimize, I am setting L to the confirmed value of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using N=5 to capture the recent lower demand regime (last 5 periods), which will signal the OR backend to reduce ordering and allow the current inventory surplus to draw down, minimizing future holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the new 71-unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) has shifted downwards significantly since Period 13. The average demand across Periods 13 to 18 is approximately 65, compared to the earlier average of around 115. Looking at the last 3 periods specifically (P16-P18), demand was 38, 62, and 36, averaging 45.33. On-hand inventory is currently very high at 366 units, which is roughly 8 periods of inventory at the current reduced demand rate. There are also 167 units in-transit (ordered in P15 and P16). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set a conservative demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect this lower regime and prevent further overstocking while holding costs accumulate. I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the shift that started in P13 (N = 18 - 13 + 1 = 6).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a lower level: avg demand for P13-P18 is ~65 (down from ~115).

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly decreased over the last several periods. Starting from Period 13, the average demand has dropped to approximately 65, and the most recent 4 periods (P16-P19) show even lower demand (38, 62, 36, 25), averaging around 40. The current on-hand inventory is 433 units, which is extremely high given this new demand level. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. My strategy is to set a low mu_hat based on the most recent demand regime (last 7 periods, P13-P19) to signal to the OR backend that the target base stock should be much lower. Since on-hand (433) + in-transit (75) = 508 is much higher than the required inventory for L+1 (5) periods of even the previous demand level, the OR backend will correctly stop ordering. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and lower volatility, while keeping L at default as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease intensified: Period 16-19 average demand dropped to ~40 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly declined over the last several periods. Observations from Period 16 to 20 show demands of 38, 62, 36, 25, and 58 respectively, resulting in a recent 5-period average of 43.8 units per period. This is a sharp drop from the earlier average of approximately 115 units. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 450 units, which is enough to cover over 10 periods of demand at the new lower rate, while the pipeline inventory is 0 (as confirmed by the conclusion of the last order placed in Period 16). Since the current inventory level is far above any reasonable base stock level (which would be roughly (1+4) * 44 = 220 units plus safety stock), no new orders are necessary. I will set the parameters to reflect this new lower demand regime. L is stable at the promised 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the downward trend while still maintaining a small buffer of variability from the recent volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand reduction confirmed from Period 16-20: average demand dropped to 43.8 units/period, down from ~115 (P1-P12). Current inventory of 450 units is excessive for the new demand level.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. From Period 1-12, the average demand was ~115 units. Starting around Period 16, demand dropped sharply, with the last 6 periods (P16-P21) averaging 47.3 units (38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59). On-hand inventory is currently 391 units with no units in transit. Given the current average demand (~47) and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, a base stock level covering L+1 (5 periods) would be approximately 235 units. Since on-hand inventory (391) significantly exceeds this requirement, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to reflect the new low-demand regime, while relying on the OR backend's capped policy to prevent further ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 16-21 average demand is 47.3 units, a ~60% reduction from the initial Period 1-12 average of 115 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $749.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the initial periods. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is approximately 48 units (38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59, 57). Current on-hand inventory is 334 units, which is extremely high given this new demand level. With a promised lead time of 4 periods and a service cycle of L+1 = 5 periods, the expected total demand over the cycle is approximately 240 units (5 * 48). Since the current on-hand inventory (334) already exceeds this coverage requirement and there are no units in-itransit, no new orders should be placed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to reflect this new demand regime (P16-P22) for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~48 units/period (P16-P22 average: 48.1), representing a ~58% drop from the early period average of ~115.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the initial simulation periods. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 51.4 units per period (38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59, 57, 72). Current inventory is 262 units with no orders in transit. Estimating the lead-time requirement (L+1) as 5 periods of demand, the target inventory position should be approximately 257 units (5 * 51.4). With 262 units on-hand, we are still slightly overstocked, justifying the continued zero-order strategy until inventory depletes further. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=8 (the duration of the current low-demand regime) to allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for this new reality, while keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~51.4 units/period (observed over P16-P23), significantly below the ~115 mean seen in P1-P12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1598.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant decline around Period 16, which previously led to an inventory surplus. However, demand has shown a recovery trend over the last few periods (P21: 59, P22: 57, P23: 72, P24: 93), surfacing from a low of 25-38. The mean demand for this recent 'recovery' phase (P21-P24) is approximately 70.25 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 169 units with 52 in-transit (total 221), while our expected demand over the lead time (L=4 + review period=1) at the current rate would be roughly 350 units. Therefore, the pipeline is now lean. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering P16-P24) to capture the shift from the deep trough to the current moderate recovery, ensuring the OR backend begins ordering again to maintain availability while demand climbs back toward historical norms.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend: Demand has increased for four consecutive periods (P21-P24), moving from ~59 to 93, indicating a potential shift out of the previous low-demand regime (~50) towards a moderate-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, demand dropped sharply to 27 units, contradicting the four-period recovery trend noted previously (P21-P24). This indicates that demand remains volatile and has not stabilized at a higher level as hypothesized. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 52.7 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory is 142 on-hand + 142 in-transit = 284 units. Based on a mean of ~53, target inventory should be around 265 units (plus safety stock). Since total inventory (284) still slightly exceeds the base stock needs for the low-regime demand, and the recovery trend failed to sustain, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current lower demand regime while allowing for the volatility observed in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend noted in P25 failed; demand remains volatile with a low average. Current regime (P16-P25) average demand is 52.7 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $558.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a low-demand regime. While there was a brief spike in Period 24 (93 units), the subsequent periods (P25: 27, P26: 35) confirm that the recovery trend noted in Period 25 was transient. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 26 is approximately 51.6 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 107 units, with 200 units in-transit (orders from P24, P25, and P26). Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are planning for demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~52 units per period, the pipeline requirement is ~260 units. Current total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 307 units, which slightly exceeds the lead-time demand coverage. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (P16-P26) to capture this stable low-demand regime, as the earlier high-demand periods (P1-P12) are no longer relevant for forecasting.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P26 is stabilized at a low mean of approximately 51.6 units per period, consistently lower than the P1-P12 mean of ~115.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 27 (the last 12 periods), the mean demand is approximately 52.2 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the history (at least up until shipments stopped arriving in Period 21 due to zero orders placed between Periods 17 and 23). The current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 226 units, and on-hand inventory is 44 units. Total inventory across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) is 270 units. With an average demand of ~52.2, we expect to need ~261 units. The inventory level is now reasonably balanced against the new demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture this stabilized lower demand mean and volatility, while keeping L at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $724.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime following a significant drop around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (P16-P28), the average demand is approximately 51 units per period, consistently lower than the historical Period 1-12 average of 115. Recent periods show continued volatility (e.g., P24 demand was 93, while P28 was 41), so I will use the mean of the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture this low-volume stabilization. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 28. Inventory is currently recovering from a drawdown, with 55 units on hand and 239 in transit; the parameters are set to maintain a base stock level that prevents stockouts during this volatile low-demand regime while avoiding the excessive holding costs seen between Periods 18-22.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P28 is confirmed stable at a lower mean of ~51 units/period (vs previous ~115).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 29 is approximately 52.4 units per period (Standard Deviation \u2248 19.3), which is a significant drop from the pre-Period 13 average of ~115. Recent periods (P25-P29) show some volatility with values of 27, 35, 63, 41, and 67, but no sustained trend of recovery to previous highs. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 78 units on-hand and 184 units in-transit (orders from P26, P27, P28, P29), the total pipeline is 262 units. Based on a mean of 52.4 over a (L+1)=5 period horizon, the expected demand is ~262 units. We are currently right in line with the required inventory to meet demand while managing holding costs. I will maintain the current regime's statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (P16 onwards) to capture this stable low-demand state.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 30, the average demand is approximately 52.3 units per period (sum of demand P16-P30 = 785; 785 / 15 = 52.3). Although there was a brief spike in P24 (93 units), recent demand has remained relatively consistent with this lower mean. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (orders from P24, P25, and P26 arrived at P28, P29, and P30 respectively). Currently, on-hand inventory is 75 units and in-transit is 197 units (orders from P27, P28, P29, P30). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 272 units. At a demand of ~52 units/period, this covers roughly 5.2 periods, which is appropriate for a Lead Time (L) of 4. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand regime while allowing for the volatility observed in this specific product category. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 16 to Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 53 units. The most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) show a mean of 57.8 units, while the period immediately following the low-spike (P28-P31) shows a mean of 56.5. There is no evidence yet of a return to the P1-P12 levels (~115). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of orders from P24, P25, P26, and P27 exactly 4 periods later. On-hand inventory is 44, and In-transit is 233 (orders from P28, P29, P30, P31). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=16) to capture the full extent of this stable low-demand regime, and sigma_hat using the same N to reflect current volatility. L remains default (4).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting from approximately Period 16. Analyzing the recent 17 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is approximately 53 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) show a slightly higher but consistent trend around 59 units, suggesting the regime remains stable at this lower level compared to the initial periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages. With on-hand inventory at 39 and in-transit units at 224, the total pipeline inventory is 263. This is approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the current average (263 / 59 \u2248 4.4). Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=17 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime while maintaining a responsive sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 16 to Period 33 (18 samples), the average demand is approximately 53.6 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P29-P33) show a consistent mean of 62.2 units, which is slightly higher than the regime average but still significantly lower than the pre-P13 levels (~115). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 28-33 matching the orders placed 4 periods prior. Current on-hand inventory is low at 18 units, while in-transit inventory is 264 units. Given L=4, the safety stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N for both demand and variance allows for responsiveness to the ongoing lower-demand level while acknowledging the slight uptick in the last few periods. I will use N=18 to capture the full stability of the current low-demand regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 34 (19 samples), the mean demand is approximately 53.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in all recent deliveries (orders from Periods 24-30 all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). Current on-hand inventory is 44 units and in-transit is 247 units (from orders in Periods 31-34). To maintain optimal service levels given the $19 profit and $1 holding cost (targeting a ~95% service level), I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters. For L, I use N=5 to capture the stable lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I use N=19 to cover the entirety of the current stable low-demand regime starting at Period 16, which provides a robust estimate of mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P34 is confirmed stable at a mean of ~53.6 units/period (StdDev ~17.5). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 35, the mean demand is approximately 53.47 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.58. This is a significant decrease from the initial mean of ~115 observed in the first 12 periods. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (as seen in recent arrivals for orders placed in P24-P31). Currently, 'on-hand' inventory is 54 and 'in-transit' is 226 units, totaling 280 units of pipeline inventory. Given the current regime's mean (53.5) and the coverage requirement for L+1 (5 periods), the expected demand is approximately 267.5 units. The pipeline is currently healthy and closely matches the required base stock for this regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stabilized low-demand regime (P16-P35) while maintaining 'default' for L to align with the reliable 4-period lead time.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower mean since Period 16. Analyzing the recent 21 periods (P16-P36), the average demand is approximately 53.6 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. Period 36 showed a spike to 108 units, but prior periods were consistently near the mean. The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), while there are 220 units in transit (orders from P33-P36: 75, 54, 41, 50). Using a 20-period recent window (approximately covering the low-demand regime since P16) provides the most relevant statistics for the backend to calculate the base stock while accounting for the recent spike in volatility (sigma).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1463.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand spiked significantly to 149 units, far exceeding the recent average of ~54 units observed since Period 16. This spike, combined with a demand of 108 in Period 36, suggests a possible second regime shift or a seasonal peak. As a result, the on-hand inventory has been depleted to 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent volatility and high demand peaks, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the average of the last 10 periods (approx 71.5 units per period) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this increased demand while the system works to replenish inventory through the pipeline. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 captures this recent upward trend better than the long-term stable average.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift or seasonal spike detected starting Period 36: Period 36-37 average demand is 128.5, compared to the P16-P35 average of ~54.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1026.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Starting Period 36, demand for chips(Regular) experienced a significant upward shift. The historical average from Period 16 to 35 was approximately 53 units, but the last three periods have seen demands of 108, 149, and 130 (averaging ~129 units). This suggests a new high-demand regime or a seasonal spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and widespread stockouts in P37 and P38, it is critical to adjust parameters to this new mean. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to focus on this new regime (target ~129 per period * (4+1) = 645). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this new level. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 36: Average demand increased from ~54 (P16-P35) to ~129 (P36-P38), a ~140% increase. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $779.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 36. The average demand from Period 36 to Period 39 is 139.75 units (108, 149, 130, 172), which is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~54. The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory, and the demand of 172 in Period 39 was only partially met (41 sold). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (current + 4 lead time). The 4-period average is ~140, so our mu_hat for the (1+L) period should be around 700. In-transit inventory is 430 (orders from P36-P39), which is below the required stock level for the new regime. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 700 and use a slightly higher sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last 4 periods (std dev of ~26 over 4 periods, scaled by sqrt(5) is ~58).

Daily Reward (R_t): $950.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 36. Demand has surged from a previous average of ~54 units to a recent 5-period average (P36-P40) of 149 units (108, 149, 130, 172, 186). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 565 units in-transit (orders from P37-P40). To prevent further stockouts while demand is climbing (reaching 186 in P40), I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the anticipated demand over the review and lead time (L+1=5). Based on the most recent 3 periods (P38-P40) average demand of ~163, I set mu_hat = 5 * 163 = 815. I will maintain a higher sigma_hat of 60 to protect against the high volatility observed in this spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 36 confirmed sustained and intensifying: P36-P40 average demand is 149.0 units, with the most recent demand (P40) reaching 186. Previous regime (P16-P35) was ~54.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1729.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 36. Demand has jumped from a stable mean of ~54 units (P16-P35) to a much higher level, with an average of 147.0 units over the last 6 periods (P36-P41). The most recent demand samples are 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, and 137. This shift has resulted in stockouts despite the lead time remaining consistent at 4 periods. With only 0 units on-hand and 682 units already in-transit (orders from P38-P41), I need to ensure the mu_hat reflects this new, higher demand regime to rebuild inventory safety. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this entire high-demand period (P36-P41) while ignoring the previous low-demand era. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 36 is sustained: P36-P41 average demand is 147.0 units, compared to the previous regime (P16-P35) average of ~54.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 36. Comparing the previous stable regime (P16-P35, mean \u2248 54) to the current active regime (P36-P42), the average demand has spiked to approximately 143.8 units per period (P36-P42: 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125). Although the most recent two periods (P41-P42) show a slight cooling from the peak of 186, they remain substantially higher than the historical baseline. We have experienced stockouts from Period 37 to Period 41 due to this sudden surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P38 order in P42. To adequately cover the (L+1) window, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P36-P42) which represent this new high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to reflect the higher volatility observed in this recent period. The high In-transit amount (714) reflects the large orders placed over the last 4 periods (P39-P42) that have yet to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P36-P42): Average demand has stabilized at ~144 units, a ~160% increase from the P16-P35 baseline (~54).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 36, increasing from a mean of ~54 to a much higher level. Over the last 8 periods (P36-P43), the average demand is approximately 154.9 units (108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, 132). Although there was a peak around Period 40 (186 units), the most recent three periods (P41-P43) have averaged 131.3 units, suggesting the initial spike might be stabilizing. To balance the need for high service levels (profit $19 vs holding $1) with recent demand evidence, I will focus on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (32), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (656 units), which will begin arriving based on the increased orders placed in Periods 40-43. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the OR backend's target base stock reflects the current high-demand state rather than the old low-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P36-P43) stabilized: Average demand over these 8 periods is ~145 units, significantly higher than the P16-P35 baseline of ~54.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume regime starting at Period 36. Over the last 9 periods (P36-P44), the average demand is approximately 143.6 units per period (108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, 132, 154). This is a dramatic increase from the prior regime (P16-P35) which averaged ~54. The system is currently in Period 45 with 63 units on hand and 590 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the decision period, we must cover 5 periods of demand. The pipeline inventory (590 + 63 = 653) is significantly higher than 5 periods of average demand (5 * 144 = 720), but the OR backend's safety stock calculation z*sigma will adjust for the high volatility (StdDev ~27 in this regime). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this new regime's mean and variance effectively. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P36-P44) average demand is ~144 units, with a standard deviation of ~27. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 36. Prior to Period 36, demand averaged ~54 units. Since Period 36 (Periods 36-45), the mean demand has risen to approximately 138 units per period, although Period 45 saw a sudden dip to 80. Despite this dip, the 10-period trend remains strong. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 191, and in-transit inventory is 537. Given the high demand regime and the promised lead time (L=4), the inventory position needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture this high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the increased volume and volatility (StdDev ~34 in the last 10 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1591.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of regime shifts. After a long period of low demand (~54 units from P16-P35), a major surge began at Period 36. From Period 36 to 44, demand averaged ~144 units. However, the last two periods (P45 and P46) have shown a noticeable cooldown, with demand dropping to 80 and 97 units respectively. This suggests the peak of the surge may have passed, or the regime is shifting toward a moderate level (~90-100 units). The current on-hand inventory is healthy at 252 units, and there are 450 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). Given that we are entering the final periods of the game (P47/50), my primary goal is to avoid excessive terminal inventory while maintaining a high service level for the remaining potential demand. I will use a shorter window (N=11, covering the start of the surge to the current period) for mu_hat to account for the peak and the recent decline, while keeping L at the established 4 periods. This helps the backend calculate a base stock that respects current pipeline levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 peaked at ~144 units but shows signs of softening in Period 45-46 (average ~88 units). Terminating game soon (P47/50), focus shifting to inventory depletion while meeting moderate demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2443.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 48 of 50. The game is nearing its end. The goal now shifts from long-term service level management to inventory depletion to avoid high holding costs and leftover stock at Period 50. Current on-hand inventory is 217 units, and 427 units are in-transit (expected arrivals in P48: 119 units, P49: 155 units, P50: 71 units). The total supply pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 644 units. Demand has been volatile, with a high-demand regime (P36-P44 avg ~145) showing recent softening (P45-P47 avg ~106). Even at the high average of 145/period, 3 periods of demand would total ~435 units. Our existing pipeline of 644 units significantly exceeds any realistic demand for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). To maximize total reward, we must stop ordering and allow the system to deplete the existing inventory. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12-period data (P36-P47) to reflect the shifted regime, while relying on the OR backend's inventory-depletion logic (base_stock - pipeline) which, given our high pipeline, should result in zero or minimal new orders.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game depletion phase initiated at Period 48: Total pipeline inventory (644 units) significantly exceeds projected demand for remaining 3 periods (estimated max 450 units). Focus is on minimizing holding cost for Period 50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2704.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. The primary objective is to maximize profit while minimizing ending inventory in Period 50 to avoid unnecessary holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is 184 units. Based on the 4-period lead time, orders arrive at the start of the period. In Period 49, we expect the order from Period 45 (155 units) to arrive, bringing available inventory to 339 before demand. In Period 50, the order from Period 46 (71 units) will arrive. Total projected units to be processed through the end of the game is significantly high (on-hand 184 + in-transit 446 = 630). Recent demand has fluctuated between 80 and 152. Even at the high end of recent demand (approx. 150/period), we require only ~300 units to cover Periods 49 and 50. Since the total pipeline (630) already far exceeds any plausible demand for the final two periods, I am setting all parameters to effectively zero out new orders. Specifically, I set L=0 to reduce the base stock calculation horizon and mu_hat/sigma_hat to very low values to ensure the OR backend's 'cap' and 'base stock - pipeline' logic results in an order of 0 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period of the simulation. The primary objective is to minimize ending inventory at the conclusion of provide 50 to avoid holding costs, as there are no subsequent periods to generate profit. Currently, on-hand inventory is 199 units. Two shipments are scheduled to arrive during Period 50: 71 units (ordered Period 46) and 82 units (ordered Period 47), totaling 153 units arriving (given the consistent 4-period lead time). This brings available stock for Period 50 to 352 units (199 + 153). Recent demand has been around 140-152 units (P47-P49). Even with a high-end demand estimate of ~150 units for Period 50, the projected ending inventory would be approximately 202 units. There is also an in-transit balance of 220 units (ordered P48-P49) that will arrive after the game ends. Since existing and arriving inventory for Period 50 already significantly exceeds expected demand, no further units should be ordered. I will set mu_hat to a very low explicit value to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation results in a zero order.
