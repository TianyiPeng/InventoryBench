Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the lead time is significant (L=4), we need to place an order immediately. Given the available historical demand data for 5 periods (95, 113, 106, 84, 71), the mean demand is 93.8 units per period and the standard deviation is approximately 17.5. Since we are in the very first step of the simulation and have no prior history of lead-time variance or supply chain disruptions, I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to calculate parameters based on all 5 historical samples. This will establish a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 469 units).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 122 units, but they have not arrived yet as the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since the starting inventory was 0, we could not satisfy any demand in Period 1 (sold 0, demand 56). The historical demand average (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) is approximately 93.8, while the actual Period 1 demand was lower at 56. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of all historical samples (including Period 1) to set our baseline forecast. I will use the 'default' method for L to stick with the promised 4 periods since no arrivals have occurred yet to suggest a shift. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will also use 'default' which uses all available samples to balance the slightly lower Period 1 demand against the higher historical data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are facing 100% lost sales because both on-hand inventory and arrivals are zero. Orders placed in P1 and P2 (122 and 123 units respectively) have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which means the P1 order is expected to arrive at the end of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Demand for the first two periods was 56 and 98 (avg ~77). The historical demand prefix (approx 93.8 avg) is slightly higher than the observed actuals (77). Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), we need to be careful not to overstock once shipments start arriving. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the system to adapt as arrivals conclude, and 'default' for demand parameters to utilize all available history (prefix + observed) until a clearer regime is established.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1-3 have not arrived yet. The first order (placed Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and becomes visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected during the lead-time initialization phase. Total demand over the first 3 periods was 291 units (avg ~97). Including the pre-game history, demand samples are [95, 113, 106, 84, 71, 56, 98, 137]. The mean demand of all 8 samples is 95. Since L=4, \u03bc\u0302 (covering 1+L = 5 periods) should be approximately 5 * 95 = 475. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data since there is no clear sustained regime shift yet, just natural variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (122 units) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4 periods later). Since the 'conclude' message for Period 4 shows 0 arrivals, this is consistent with a 4-period lead time. However, due to the arrival sequence, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in Periods 1-4. The total in-transit is 505 units (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples provided are [95, 113, 106, 84, 71]. The history in the logs shows [56, 98, 137, 82] for periods 1-4. Combining these, the average demand is approximately 93 units per period. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet to verify actual lead time, I will stick with the promised L=4. I will use recent_N for demand parameters to reflect the recent average of ~94 units observed over the last 5 samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on 'Period 5 conclude', the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (as promised). This confirms the lead time L=4. Demand data for the first 5 periods are: 56, 98, 137, 82, 111 (noting that demand was satisfied only in Period 5 because that's when the first shipment arrived). The mean demand over these 5 periods is 96.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 30. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 1+L = 5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 11 and in-transit is 383 (from orders in periods 2, 3, and 4). Total pipeline inventory is 394. I will use the 'default' lead time (setting L to promised 4) and use all 5 historical demand samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no clear evidence of a regime shift yet.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 6 (demand was 167, only 134 units available). In-transit inventory is 407 units, representing orders from P3 (123), P4 (137), and P6 (147). No order was placed in P5. The carry-over insight confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since P3's order was placed 4 periods ago, it should arrive during this period (P7), followed by P4's order in P8. Historical demand samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) and game history demand (56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167) show significant volatility. The mean demand across all 11 periods is ~111 units. Given the recent stockout and the high demand in P6 (167), I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level. The OR backend uses (1+L) for mu_hat; with L=4, we are covering 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 targets the more recent observation trend while maintaining a look-back that includes both low and high demand periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout scenario with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows that orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods, confirming the promised lead time. However, due to high demand (P6: 167, P7: 135) and delayed arrivals relative to when demand occurs, we have been losing sales. The current in-transit pipeline (459 units) includes orders from P4 (137 units), P6 (147 units), and P7 (175 units). Based on lead time L=4, the P4 order should arrive in Period 8's arrival phase, making it available for P9's decision phase. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is approximately 126.4. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture the recent trend and set L=4 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the full cycle. sigma_hat will also use the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The demand history shows some growth and variability: P1-P4 demand averaged ~93, but P5-P8 demand averaged ~135. With current on-hand inventory at 9 and total in-transit at 501 units (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8), we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Given the recent increase in demand, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher mean around 135. The OR backend will calculate the order based on this mean and the corresponding recent standard deviation, adjusted for the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg increased from ~93 to ~135 (+45%) based on last 4 periods (P5-P8).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, which is consistently observed (P1-P4 all arrived at P5-P8 respectively). However, nothing arrived in Period 9 (expected P5 order), but looking at history, Period 5 had an order quantity of 0, explaining the zero arrival in Period 9. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P5-P9) has been 111, 167, 135, 128, 106, averaging 129.4. This confirms the previously noted demand regime shift. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand and variance to capture this higher volume and volatility. The inventory position is currently reliant on the 675 units in-transit. Setting L to default (4) is appropriate given the consistency of shipping so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $423.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11. Analysis of history confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since the arrivals for orders placed in P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 have all concluded with a lead time of 4, we maintain L at the promised 4. Demand shifted significantly around P5; from P5 to P10, the demand samples are [111, 167, 135, 128, 106, 114], yielding an average of approximately 127 units per period. The earlier periods (P1-P4) had an average of about 93. I will transition to using N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations. Note: The P5 order was 0, and the P9 order of 174 is expected in P13 (currently in-transit). The low order in P10 (18) was likely due to the OR backend seeing the high pipeline (P6, P7, P8, P9 orders) relative to its internal base stock. My parameters will reflect the 127/period demand across the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are evaluating the demand and lead time performance for chips(Regular). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11. Although Period 9 saw no arrival, Period 5 (our order period for P1) also place no order, which explains the '0' arrival in Period 9. The pipeline is healthy with 469 units in transit. Demand from Periods 5-11 shows a mean of approximately 124 units (111, 167, 135, 128, 106, 114, 108), which is higher than the initial periods 1-4 (avg 93), confirming the regime shift noted in previous carry-over insights. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand regime and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the associated volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time is consistently matching the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 158 units and an in-transit pipeline of 383 units. Analysis of recent arrival messages (Periods 10, 11, and 12) confirms that the actual lead time L remains consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime shift noted in Period 9 remains relevant; demand from Period 5 through Period 12 has averaged approximately 127.5 units, which is a significant increase from the initial periods. However, recent demand (P9-P12) shows a slight cooling or stabilization around 112 units. Given this, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the entire post-shift regime from P5 to P12) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging recent stability. sigma_hat will also use N=8 to reflect the current regime's volatility. Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as observed lead times match the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P5-P12 stabilized at an average of ~127 units, slightly lower than the initial spike estimate but consistently higher than P1-P4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a stabilized demand regime that shifted around Period 5. The mean demand from Period 5 to Period 13 is approximately 117 units, though Period 13 saw a notable drop to 68 units. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs. profit of $4.0, maintaining a healthy service level is important, but we must avoid overstocking as on-hand inventory has risen to 264 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P9 arrived at P13, P8 at P12, etc.). The in-transit pipeline of 325 units combined with 264 on-hand (total 589) covers roughly 5 periods of demand at the regime average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since the Period 5 shift, which will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the current inventory levels while maintaining the target service level based on the observed variance in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history from Period 5 to Period 14 shows a stabilized regime with an average demand of approximately 114.4 units per period (sum of P5-P14 demand = 1144 / 10 periods). While the carry-over insight noted a shift to ~127 earlier, the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) have averaged ~103 units, suggesting a slight cooling from the initial spike. Specifically, Period 13 saw a significant dip to 68 units. Given the current On-hand inventory of 176 and In-transit of 356 (total pipeline = 532), and a lead time consistently observed at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the post-Period 5 shift while smoothing recent fluctuations. I will use recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this newer regime. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P10-P14 shows a slight softening to an average of ~103 units compared to the P5-P9 average of ~129 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 10 to Period 15 shows a softening trend, averaging approximately 99.6 units per period (114, 108, 121, 68, 106, 81). This is a noticeable step down from the Period 5-9 peak which averaged ~129. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrivals from P11 back to P10). Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy at 193 units, and there are 356 units in transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15). Given the promised lead time L=4, my parameters must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the most recent 6 periods of lower demand, I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this recent regime and avoid over-ordering, as inventory is already building up.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-96.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 248 units with 263 units in transit. The lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 13, there has been a noticeable decline in demand. The average demand for Periods 13 to 16 is 73.25 units (68, 106, 81, 38), which is significantly lower than the previous regime (Period 5-12 average was ~127). The most recent observation (Period 16) was only 38 units. Consequently, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this most recent downward trend in demand, as the warehouse is currently well-stocked relative to this lower demand. A 4-period window focuses on this softening phase specifically.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand decreased to ~73 units from ~127 units (-42%) based on last 4 periods (P13-P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-54.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly decreased over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). The average demand in this recent regime is approximately 71 units (68, 106, 81, 38, 62), down from the previous average of ~127 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 302 units, and there are 147 units in-transit (orders from P14 and P15). With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 18 plus the 4 periods of lead time (total 5 periods). At an estimated demand of ~71 units/period, the target inventory (base stock) would be around 355 units (71 * 5). Since our pipeline inventory (on-hand 302 + in-transit 147 = 449) already exceeds this level, no new orders are expected to be triggered by the OR backend. I am setting L=4 (promised) and using the recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the OR logic uses the current lower volatility and mean to avoid further over-ordering while holding costs are high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-171.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting around Period 13. The average demand for the last six periods (P13-P18) is approximately 58.5 units (68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36), which is significantly lower than the previous regime (~127 units). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 315 units, which is quite high compared to this new demand level. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders (P1-P14). Given the current high inventory (315 units) and the in-transit quantity (98 units from P15), and the lower demand trend, I need to adjust the mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower regime to avoid accumulating excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the lower demand. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower demand average and volatility. L will remain at default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistent with observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: demand has dropped from ~127 to an average of ~58 units (based on P13-P18). Inventory levels are currently high relative to this new demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-288.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. While earlier periods (P5-P12) averaged ~127 units, the last 7 periods (P13-P19) have seen a drop to an average of ~59 units (68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36, 25), with the most recent 4 periods averaging only ~40 units. We are currently in a state of extreme oversupply with 388 units on-hand and zero in-transit, which covers nearly 10 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and a critical ratio (profit/(profit+holding)) of 0.8, the system should naturally stop ordering to burn off excess inventory. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this lower demand regime (P13-P19), and keep L at default since observed lead times are stable at 4 periods. The goal is to minimize further holding costs while demand stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: average demand has dropped to ~59 units (based on P13-P19) from the previous ~127 level. Current inventory (388) is very high relative to this new demand.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 13. Over the last 8 periods (P13-P20), the average demand is approximately 59.25 units (68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36, 25, 58). Current on-hand inventory is 330 units with 0 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods (making the look-ahead window L+1 = 5 periods), the total needed base stock would be roughly 296 units (59.25 * 5). Since current inventory (330) already exceeds this requirement, I will maintain the current settings to allow inventory to further deplete. I am using recent_N=8 to capture the current lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend's mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this post-P13 behavior.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 13 is firmly established. Over the last 9 periods (P13-P21), the average demand is approximately 59.2 units (68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59). However, focusing on the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) where the drop became more severe, the average is ~46.3 units with a standard deviation of ~14.9. Currently, on-hand inventory (271) is extremely high, representing nearly 6 periods of supply even at the 46-unit demand level. The pipeline is almost empty (17 units in transit). Given the lead time L=4, my parameters must target or + in-transit covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 46 = 230 units. Since 271 + 17 = 288 units are already in the system, the OR backend should naturally stop ordering. I will use recent_N (N=6) to reflect this lower demand environment accurately and help the backend realize it is overstocked.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted to a lower level since Period 13. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), demand has averaged approximately 59 units (Demand values: 68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59, 57). The most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) show an even lower average of ~47 units, though the range remains volatile (25 to 59). On-hand inventory is currently 214 units, which is over 4.5 times the recent average demand of 47. With a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 periods * 59 units/period = 295 units required pipeline. Currently, we have 214 on-hand + 17 in-transit = 231 total. While we are slightly below the theoretical base stock for the 598-unit average, the high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) and the very high current inventory relative to the most recent 'soft' demand suggests we should still be cautious about over-ordering. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current lower regime of ~59 units/period, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P13-P22 has stabilized at an average of ~59 units/period, down from the previous peak. Most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) suggest a potential further softening to ~47 units/period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a lower stabilization phase since Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 23 is approximately 56 units. More specifically, the last five periods (P19-P23) have shown demand values of 25, 58, 59, 57, and 72, averaging 54.2 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 142 and in-transit is 115, totaling 257 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the current regime, the base stock targets (1+L=5 periods of demand) should be roughly 270-300 units. Since 257 is approaching this buffer, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the P13-P23 regime) to allow the OR backend to recalculate the order requirements based on the sustained lower demand pattern. This will prevent excessive stock-out while managing holding costs as the inventory level normalizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P13-P23 stabilized at an average of ~56 units/period, marking a significant drop from the P5-P12 peak of ~127 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 13, decreasing significantly. Over the last 12 periods (P13-P24), demand has averaged approximately 63 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) show a slight uptick to 67.8 units, with Period 24 reaching 93. This suggests the downward trend has potentially reversed or stabilized higher. On-hand inventory is currently low (49 units), and although there are 202 units in-transit (orders from P21, P23, P24), the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the backend base-stock calculation incorporates lead time (L) and the pipeline, I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture the lower post-shift demand average (~63 units) while accounting for the recent variance, ensuring the order covers the lead period plus one (L+1=5). This method allows the OR backend to reconcile the current high pipeline against the lower demand mean to avoid over-ordering while protecting against the recent demand increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. After a peak around Period 12, demand dropped significantly starting at Period 13 and has recently averaged ~56 units/period (P13-P24). However, the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) show high volatility with demands of 59, 57, 72, 93, and 27, averaging 61.6 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P21 order arrived at P25). My current inventory state is low on-hand (39) but high in-transit (287). The in-transit units are from orders in P23 (98), P24 (87), and P25 (102). These are expected to arrive in P27, P28, and P29 respectively. Since the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. With a mean demand estimate of ~62 (based on recent volatility), the target base stock is roughly 310. Total pipeline (on-hand 39 + in-transit 287) is 326, which is slightly above the requirement for the next 5 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 13, demand has undergone a significant downward shift, stabilizing around 50-60 units, though very recent demand (P25-P26) has been even lower (~31 units). Curiously, we had an order from P21 arrive in P25 (lead time 4), but the order from P23 (due in P27) has not reached the 'Period 26 conclude' phase yet, which is normal as arrivals occur during the period. However, we have a very low on-hand inventory of 4 units and a massive in-transit pipeline of 315 units (ordered in P23, P24, P25, and P26). Given the low demand regime, the current in-transit stock is likely to lead to high holding costs once it arrives. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the stabilized lower demand regime (last 14 periods, P13-P26, avg ~54) to prevent excessive ordering. For L and sigma_hat, I will use calculate and recent_N=14 to reflect the current regime's volatility and the observed lead time stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P13-P26 stabilized at an average of ~54 units/period, significantly lower than previous peaks. Pipeline inventory (315) is very high relative to current demand, which will increase holding costs once arrivals resume.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 13. Calculating the average of the most recent 15 periods (P13-P27) yields a mean demand of approximately 54.8 units/period. The standard deviation across this same range is approximately 23.4. The lead time appears stable at 4 periods (consistent with recent concludes for orders from P21 and P23). Currently, on-hand inventory is 39 units and in-transit is 217 units (total pipeline = 256). With an expected demand of ~55 units per period and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, the required stock to cover demand is approximately 275 units. Given that the current inventory plus pipeline (256) is slightly below the required 275, and we want to avoid stockouts while being mindful of holding costs, I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=15) to capture this low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 13 and has stabilized at a lower mean. Over the last 15 periods (P14-P28), the average daily demand is approximately 53 units. Most recently, the last 5 periods (P24-P28) averaged 51.8 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 85 and in-transit is 212 (total inventory = 297). Given a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 periods * 53 units/period = 265 units. Since our pipeline (297) already exceeds this coverage requirement, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic will likely produce a zero or very small order. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime, while relying on the backend to manage the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P14-P28 stabilized at an average of ~53 units/period, down from previous peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 13. The average demand from Period 14 to Period 29 is approximately 53 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), demand has fluctuated but remains around this level (avg ~47-67). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current 'On-hand' inventory is 120 units, and 'In-transit' is 143 units, totaling a pipeline of 263 units. Given the desired service level (calculated by the OR backend using profit/holding cost) and a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At 53 units/period, the base stock should be around 265 units. Since pipeline inventory (263) is already very close to this requirement, the order quantity should be minimal or zero to avoid rising holding costs, which have been a significant factor in recent periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 to capture the stable low-demand regime since P14, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 13. Over the last 18 periods (P13-P30), the average demand is approximately 54.4 units per period. Most recently, the average over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 53.4, and the average over the last 10 periods (P21-P30) is 57.2. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P28, P29, P30). The current inventory (On-hand: 87, In-transit: 184) totals 271 units, which covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain a safety stock while accounting for the recent regime, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=18) to capture the stable lower-demand regime since P13, and sigma_hat is also calculated over that same stable period to reflect current volatility.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to earlier peaks. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 21-31), the average demand is approximately 54.5 units per period. The inventory position is currently managed by a significant pipeline of 246 units. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on historical conclusions (e.g., P30 arrival was ordered on P26). With current on-hand inventory at 30 and recent demand averaging ~55, the pipeline is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5; 5 * 55 = 275 required vs 276 total inventory). I will set mu_hat using the last 11 periods (P21-P31) to capture this stable low-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using the same period for local volatility. L is set to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P21-P31 has stabilized at an average of ~55 units/period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to earlier peaks. Since Period 13, the average demand has fluctuated between 50 and 60 units. Specifically, from Period 21 to Period 32, the average demand is 58.5 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 42 units, and in-transit inventory is 210 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~58.5, the total required pipeline is approximately 293 units. Currently, our total inventory (on-hand 42 + in-transit 210 = 252) is slightly below this target. I will use the recent 12 periods (P21-P32) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable lower demand regime and provides enough variance data. The backend will then calculate the order based on the critical ratio (Profit $4 / ($4+$1) = 0.8), ensuring we maintain sufficient stock without excessive holding costs.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~55 units per period since Period 21. Recent demand (P21-P33) shows a mean of 57.6 and a standard deviation of 17.1. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent arrivals (P32 and P33 both arrived with lead_time=4). There are currently 19 units on hand and 251 units in-transit. The OR backend will compute the order based on a base-stock level for L+1 (5 periods). Using recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this stable regime while excluding the earlier high-demand volatility. This should prevent over-ordering given the significant pipeline inventory (251) relative to the projected 5-period demand (~288 units to cover 5 periods).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 has remained consistently around 50-60 units. Specifically, the average demand of the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is 52.2 units, which is consistent with the established carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 43, and there are 236 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean of ~53, the pipeline requirement is approx 265 units. Current total inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 279, which is slightly above the requirement but reasonable given our profit margin ($4) vs holding cost ($1) which suggests a service level (q) of 0.80. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable but slightly lower demand volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 13, currently averaging 55.3 units over the last 23 periods. Comparison of the most recent window (P31-P35) shows an average demand of 56.0 units, indicating no significant shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 53, and in-transit inventory is 184 units (from periods 32, 33, 34, and 35). Total pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit = 237) covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand (237 / 56). Since the inventory position is adequate for the 4-period lead time plus the decision period, the OR backend will likely recommend a small order to maintain the base stock. I will use a recent_N of 23 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability of the current demand regime starting from P13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, demand spiked to 108 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization average of ~55 units. This resulted in zero ending on-hand inventory. The current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 228 units, comprising orders from Periods 33-36. Based on history, the lead time is stable at 4 periods. The arrivals for the next few periods are expected to be: 74 (P33 order) in P37, 54 (P34 order) in P38, 10 (P35 order) in P39, and 90 (P36 order) in P40. The spike in Period 36 (108) might indicate a new demand regime or a temporary peak. To ensure we provide sufficient service level without over-committing given the high pipeline relative to historical mean, I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand estimation (covering Period 27-36, which captures both the stable period and the recent spike). Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 36 (108 units), deviating from the ~55 unit average established since Period 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a significant demand spike. Period 36 demand was 108 units and Period 37 reached 149 units, which is nearly triple the previous baseline of ~55 units. This suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal peak has begun. I have 0 on-hand inventory and 247 in-transit. With a 4-period lead time, I must adjust the base stock to cover this higher demand level to minimize lost sales, while being mindful that the OR backend's capping logic will limit the order size based on historical stats. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this upward movement as quickly as possible. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: Demand has surged from ~55 to an average of 128.5 units over the last 2 periods (+133%), likely indicating a new high-demand phase or seasonal event.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significant new high-demand regime starting at Period 36. Demand in the last three periods (P36, P37, P38) has been 108, 149, and 130 respectively, averaging 129 units per period. This is a sharp increase (+135%) from the previous long-term average of ~55 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this new surge quickly and N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new phase. In-transit inventory is 350, while expected demand over the lead time is approximately 645 units (5 * 129), necessitating aggressive ordering to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: Average demand increased from ~55 to ~129 units (+135%) based on P36-P38. This is likely a sustained high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 36 is clearly sustained and substantial. Since Period 36, demand has been 108, 149, 130, and 172, averaging approximately 139.75 units per period. This represents a major increase from the previous baseline of ~55 units. Due to this shift, the system has stockouted for four consecutive periods (P36-P39), as on-hand inventory was insufficient to meet the surge. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this new high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level is rapidly adjusted upward to stop the stockouts. While 'In-transit' is 503, much of this consists of orders placed before the full scale of the surge was known; therefore, the OR backend must continue to order to meet the (L+1) horizon demand of approximately 700 units (140 * 5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: Average demand has increased from ~55 to ~140 units (+154%) based on P36-P39. The system has stockouted for 4 periods due to this surge.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant demand surge that began in Period 36. The most recent demand samples are: P36=108, P37=149, P38=130, P39=172, P40=186. The average demand over these 5 periods is 149 units, showing a clear upward trend. The system has stockouted for 5 consecutive periods because the current peak demand exceeds the supply ordered during the previous low-demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a large pipeline (598 units), we need to set the parameters to reflect this new high-demand regime to ensure the OR backend places sufficiently large orders to recover service levels once the high-demand orders (placed from P36 onwards) start arriving. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this surge specifically.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: Average demand has increased from ~55 to ~149 units over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), with a clear upward trend reaching 186 in P40.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 36 is confirmed and sustained. Over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand has averaged approximately 148 units (108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137), a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~55. Currently, the system is experience extreme stockouts due to this surge. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current demand trend of roughly 145-150 units per period, the OR parameters must be set to aggressively recover inventory levels. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to estimate the new mean demand and variance, ensuring the base stock level (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods of demand) while the OR engine caps orders to avoid excessive over-ordering if the trend plateaus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: Average demand has stabilized at ~148 units/period (based on P36-P41) compared to the previous ~55 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 36, likely due to a seasonal or cyclical peak. Demand in the last 7 periods (P36-P42) has averaged 144.7 units, with the most recent three periods (P40-P42) displaying values of 186, 137, and 125. The current on-hand inventory is low (32 units). However, there is a very large pipeline of 632 units currently in-transit, including high-volume orders placed during the peak (P39: 163, P40: 185, P41: 201). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 7 periods remaining in the simulation, a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand regime) effectively captures the current mean of ~145. Given the high pipeline relative to remaining periods and the potential for demand to soften back to previous levels after the peak, I am utilizing 'recent_N' to maintain a responsive but stabilized forecast. This prevents over-ordering at the end of the simulation while ensuring we aim to meet the current higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P36-P42 has stabilized at an average of ~145 units/period (+163% over the P21-P31 average of ~55).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 36. Over the last 8 periods (P36-P43), the average demand has been approximately 143.6 units, compared to the previous average of ~55. While recent periods (P41-P43) show a slight cooling from the peak of 186 in P40 (137, 125, 132), the demand remains structurally higher. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 63, and there is a large pipeline of 576 units. Given the high pipeline, the OR backend's capped policy will likely limit the order size to prevent overstocking at the end of the game (Period 50), especially as holding costs ($1) are relatively high compared to profit ($4). I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 36. From P36 to P44, the average demand is 151.4 units/period (108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, 132, 154). The most recent 5 periods (P40-P44) show an average of 146.4 units. The 'In-transit' inventory of 513 units consists of orders from P41 (201 units), P42 (83 units), P43 (107 units), and P44 (122 units), all of which are within the consistent 4-period lead time window confirmed by recent arrivals (P38-P44 all arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). No shipments are currently lost or overdue. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 9 periods (N=9) to capture the full extent of this new high-demand regime (P36-P44). I will set L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 matches the consistently observed actual lead time. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P36-P44 stabilized at an average of ~151 units/period, representing a sustained high-demand phase compared to the previous ~55 units average.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major shift starting at Period 36, jumping from a baseline of ~55 units to an average of ~144 units over the last 10 periods (P36-P45). However, Period 45 showed a significant drop to 80 units, although this is only a single data point and may be noise or the start of a softening. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 215 and in-transit at 470, the pipeline (685) is quite high relative to the most recent demand average (144 * 5 = 720 for a L+1 window). I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (avg ~144) to capture the high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent lower sample, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility seen since the regime shift. This balanced approach protects against stockouts if Period 45 was an outlier while preventing excessive overstocking if demand is returning to lower levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime (P36-P44 avg ~151) appears to have softened significantly over the last two periods (P45=80, P46=97, avg=88.5). This decrease suggests the surge phase may be concluding or stabilizing at a lower midpoint. Currently, on-hand inventory (201) and in-transit units (446) are high. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high pipeline and the observed demand drop, I am reducing mu_hat to reflect the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46 avg ~117.6) to avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 50), while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening at Period 45: Average demand decreased from ~151 to ~89 units over the last 2 periods (P45-P46), following the high-demand surge that began at Period 36.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a period of high volatility following a major surge that began at Period 36. While the average demand from P36 to P44 was ~151 units, the last three periods (P45-P47) have shown more erratic behavior: 80, 97, and 140 units, averaging ~106 units. This suggests the peak of the surge may be passing, but demand remains significantly higher than the pre-surge baseline of ~55. With 168 units on-hand and 340 units in transit (due to large orders placed during the stockout phase), we are currently well-stocked. To avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods of the game (ending P50) while maintaining coverage for the high-end volatility (~140-154), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest softening trend (~106 units/period), and use explicit sigma_hat to account for the high standard deviation observed during this surge phase (~30 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime following Period 36 surge is showing increased volatility: last 3 periods (P45-P47) average ~106 units, while the peak surge (P36-P44) averaged ~151 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $470.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the recent period following a major surge that began in Period 36. After an initial peak averaging ~151 units (P36-P44), the last four periods (P45-P48) have shown demand values of 80, 97, 140, and 152. This suggests a highly variable phase with a recent average of ~117 units, down from the peak but still much higher than the pre-surge average of ~55. Given this volatility and the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 50), the goal is to maintain sufficient stock for the remaining two periods without over-ordering. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since my current on-hand (138) and pipeline (295) are quite high (total 433) relative to the recent average demand (117), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the surge at Period 36) to capture the overall high-demand regime while allowing the backend to account for the current pipeline. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=13 to capture the increased volatility of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime following Period 36 peak remains highly volatile: last 4 periods (P45-P48) average 117.25 units, showing large fluctuations (80 to 152).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the demand environment for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a volatile high-demand state that began around Period 36. Since Period 45, demand has fluctuated significantly (ranging from 80 to 152), with the last four periods (P46-P49) averaging 132.25 units. This is slightly lower than the peak surge (P36-P44) but remains much higher than the historical baseline of 55. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 156 and in-transit at 321, total pipeline inventory is 477. Using the most recent 14 periods (P36-P49) to capture this entire high-demand regime, the average demand is 142.6 units with a standard deviation of 30.2. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=14 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus current period (5 periods total), while accounting for the recent volatility to maintain high service levels during this active phase.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P36-P49) has stabilized at an average of ~143 units/period, despite volatility in the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49) averaging 121.8 units.
