Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows the following: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71. The mean demand is 93.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 16.9. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). A simple calculation of (1+L) * mean gives 5 * 93.8 = 469. Given the holding cost and profit are both $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (meaning the base_stock will be close to the mean demand over the period). I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant historical data.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and ordered 122 units. No units arrived this period (consistent with a promised lead time of 4 and arrival resolution occurring after the decision phase). Demand was 56, but since on-hand was 0, those sales were lost. For Period 2, we have 122 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4. Based on the 5 provided historical samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71), the average demand is 93.8. Including the Period 1 observation (56), the 6-period average is 87.5. Since we are in the very early stages (Period 2), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the initial behavior while acknowledging the lower demand observed in Period 1. L is set to default as we haven't seen any arrivals to contradict the promised lead time of 4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 56 and 98, respectively. The cumulative historical demand provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5) shows an average of ~94 units per period. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 248 units in transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect the P1 order (122 units) to arrive until the start of Period 5 (visible at P6 decision). This means we will likely face stockouts (sold=0) until those units arrive. Given the current 0 on-hand state and the lead time, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the actual observed demand (98 and 56, avg 77) while the historical samples suggest a slightly higher trend. Using N=3 for sigma_hat to capture the initial volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to prove a deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The current state for 'chips(Regular)' shows 0 on-hand inventory and 361 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 have not yet arrived, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time (P1 order expected to arrive in P5 at the earliest according to the timing rules). Initial demand samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) provided in the prompt suggest an average demand of approximately 93.8 units per period. However, observed demand in the game history for P1-P3 (56, 98, 137) shows high volatility and a potential upward trend (avg 97). Given the inventory is currently 0 and we are losing sales, I will use a slightly more responsive approach. Since no orders have arrived yet, actual lead time cannot be inferred; I will stick to the 'default' promised lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent game history dynamics as the initial seeded samples may not perfectly reflect the game environment behavior.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-4 are currently in-transit (Total 485 units). According to the lead-time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (122 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 6 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for the first 4 periods. Since no arrivals have occurred yet, we cannot verify if the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods. Demand for the last 5 periods (95, 113, 106, 84, 71 - provided in historical data, though concluded messages show slightly different values, I will rely on the provided historical sequence) shows an average of approximately 94 units. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning we aim to cover mean demand during the lead time + review period. I will use a conservative N=5 for demand and the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on 'Period 5 conclude', the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time is 4). However, because arrivals occur after the decision phase, we started Period 5 with 0 stock but ended with 11 units after the arrival of 122 units and a demand of 111. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 56, 98, 137, 82, 111 (average ~96.8). The demand samples provided in the prompt (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) differ from the 'conclude' messages; I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages as they reflect the actual game state. Currently, on-hand is low (11), but in-transit is 363 (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Average demand is ~97, so base stock should be ~485. Pipeline (11 + 363 = 374) suggests we need to order more. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and standard lead time parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Current history shows demand for the last 6 periods: 56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167 (average: ~108.5). The observed lead time for two completed cycles (orders from P1 and P2) is exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 347 units in-transit (P3: 113, P4: 124, P6: 110). Order from P3 is expected to arrive during P7 resolution (visible P8). Recent demand (P6=167) suggests a potential upward shift compared to the initial mean. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent volatility and mean demand. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand over the lead time plus one period (L+1=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by arrivals in Period 5 (from P1), Period 6 (from P2), and Period 7 (from P3). The demand history shows an upward trend and significant volatility: Period 1-5 mean was ~96, but the most recent periods (P6-P7) show demand spikes to 167 and 135. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in P6 and P7 because the initial orders (placed with less data) were insufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent higher demand levels (averaging ~125 across P3-P7). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5; setting robust parameters is necessary to prevent continued lost sales while in-transit stock catches up.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Analyzing the history, demand has shown an upward trend and high volatility: {56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167, 135, 128}. The average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 130.6 units, compared to the overall average of 114.25. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as seen in Period 5-8 conclusions for orders placed in P1-P4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand has exceeded supply for several periods, leading to lost sales. In-transit inventory is 464 (orders from P6, P7, and P8). To address the increased demand and stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher demand regime (approx 130/period) more accurately than the long-term average. Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, so 'default' or 'calculate' is appropriate; I will use 'calculate' to rely on observed data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 6: avg demand increased to approximately 130 units/period from an initial low start. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical data shows a demand regime shift starting around Period 6. The mean demand for Periods 6-9 is 134 units, compared to the earlier average. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the order from Period 5 (which should have arrived in Period 9 based on the 4-period lead time) was for 0 units. We have 623 units in transit. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1, P2, P3, and P4). To cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), we set mu_hat based on the recent higher demand trend (recent_N=4) and maintain sigma_hat based on the same period to capture the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of past arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10) confirms the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods. The order placed in Period 5 was 0, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 9 conclude message (P5+4=P9). Since a lead time of 4 means we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods, and our current pipeline (560 units) reflects orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10, we need to ensure the parameters represent the current demand regime. Demand since Period 6 has averaged roughly 130 units (167, 135, 128, 106, 114). However, we are frequently hitting 0 ending inventory and losing sales. The backend OR uses z* based on profit and holding cost. Here, profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), so q = 0.5 and z* = 0. This means the base stock is simply the expected demand over the lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~130/period (total mu_hat around 650).

Since then (P6-P11), the demand values are [167, 135, 128, 106, 114, 108], averaging 126.33 units/period with a standard deviation of 22.8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and conclude messages for P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, and P11 confirm the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (except for P9, which showed 0 arrivals but P10 and P11 resumed order delivery). Current on-hand is 67, with 475 units in transit (expected from orders at P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since the demand has stabilized at this higher level for 6 periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this regime accurately for both mean and standard deviation. The backend will calculate base_stock using (1+L) = 5 periods of protection.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. Examining history, arrivals confirm the lead time is steady at 4 periods (as seen in Period 10, 11, and 12). Since lead time L=4, the planning horizon is (L+1) = 5 periods. Demand Analysis: A regime shift was previously noted around Period 6. Looking at the last 7 periods (P6 to P12), demand values are: 167, 135, 128, 106, 114, 108, 121. The mean of these observations is approximately 125.57. I will use N=7 to capture this specific regime. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same 7-period window to capture current volatility. Current on-hand is 125 and in-transit is 386, totaling 511. The backend OR logic will compare this to the base stock (calculated from mu_hat and sigma_hat) to determine the period order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 125-130 units starting Period 6. Lead time reliably holding at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the demand in Period 13 dropped significantly to 68 units, which is much lower than the regime average of ~125-130 established since Period 6. This might be a random fluctuation or a new downward shift. However, following the principle of being conservative with regime changes, I will maintain a focus on the last 8 periods (Period 6-13) where demand has generally stayed higher, while including this last data point. The mean demand for Periods 6-13 is approximately 119.6 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (as seen in Period 13 conclude: order from P9 arrived, L=4). Current on-hand is 216 and in-transit is 344, totaling 560 units. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 119.6 = 598. Therefore, we are slightly below the desired pipeline for the current regime. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-initial-ramp-up behavior while incorporating the latest volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, the inventory position is relatively high (On-hand: 157, In-transit: 329). The carry-over insights and recent history (Periods 6-14) show a stable demand regime despite some fluctuations. The average demand across the last 9 periods (P6-P14) is approximately 116 units, with a standard deviation around 28. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since P6, demand has ranged from 68 to 167. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the demand mean and variance since the detected regime shift in Period 6. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the risk of stockouts against the holding cost, which is equal to the profit margin ($1/unit). L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-85.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have an on-hand inventory of 166 and in-transit inventory of 338. Our lead time (L) is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand regime from Period 6 onwards has stabilized, though recent samples (Periods 13-15) show a slight cooling from the peak (68, 106, 81). Calculating the mean for the stable regime (Period 6 to 15), the average demand is approximately 109.4. Using N=10 for mu_hat will capture this stabilized average including the recent variance. At L=4, the base stock targets (L+1) or 5 periods of demand. With Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand to minimize the sum of lost sales and holding costs. Setting L to provide a buffer for the 4-period lead time remains appropriate as it matches observed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6 to 15 has stabilized at an average of ~110 units/period (down from earlier ~130 estimate). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-180.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a current on-hand inventory of 218 units and a significant in-transit pipeline of 311 units. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in Carry-over Insights and confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8 and 10-16). Demand has shown a downward trend recently: the last 5 periods (P12-P16) recorded demands of 121, 68, 106, 81, and 38, averaging 82.8 units. This is a noticeable drop from the previous regime of ~110 units. Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (z* \u2248 0), meaning the backend aims for the base stock to match the expected demand over the (L+1) period horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent cooling trend and prevent excessive overstocking, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: avg demand decreased from ~110 to ~83 units/period (-25%) over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-211.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a lower regime since approximately Period 12. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P12-P17) is approximately 79 units, compared to the previously observed ~110 units. Total on-hand inventory is high at 273 units, with another 194 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, which corresponds to setting the base stock at the mean demand (z=0). Currently, our pipeline (On-hand 273 + In-transit 194 = 467) is significantly higher than the expected demand over (L+1) periods (approx 5 * 79 = 395). To avoid excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 6 periods to reflect the current lower demand regime. This will likely result in a zero order from the OR engine to bleed off excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: avg demand decreased to ~79 units/period (approx -28% from previous 110 avg) based on 6 periods of data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-233.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 12. Initially, demand was higher (avg ~110-130), but over the last 7 periods (P12-P18), the mean has dropped considerably to approximately 75 units/period (68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36). The average demand over the last 5 periods is even lower (~65). On-hand inventory is currently very high (269 units) relative to recent demand, and there are 162 units still in-transit. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and declining demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this lower demand regime. This will result in a lower base stock, helping to reduce the excess inventory and minimize holding costs, while the OR backend's safety stock (sigma_hat) will mitigate the risk of stockouts if demand fluctuates back up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed and deepening: avg demand decreased to ~75 units/period (based on periods 12-18), with most recent 3 periods averaging <50 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-318.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting around Period 12. Specifically, the average demand from Period 12 to 19 is approximately 67 units, but the last four periods (16-19) show an even lower average of ~40 units (38, 62, 36, 25). Current on-hand inventory is 343 units, which is extremely high given the current demand trend (covering roughly 8-10 periods of demand). With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory should cover (L+1)=5 periods. 5 periods at an average of 40 units suggests a base stock level of roughly 200 units. Since on-hand (343) plus in-transit (63) far exceeds this, no further orders are likely needed for several periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the decline since Period 12 while giving weight to the very low recent observations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: avg demand dropped significantly to ~40 units/period (based on P16-P19), a further 45% decrease from the P12-P15 average of ~73 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-290.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant and sustained decline. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approx 45 units/period (38, 62, 36, 25, 58). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 348 units with zero units in-transit. With a 4-period lead time, the inventory position covers (1+L) periods of demand if we use the recent average (5 * 45 = 225 units). The current on-hand inventory (348) is already significantly higher than the 225 units required for the target base stock. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend service level target (q) is 0.5. To allow the excessive inventory to deplete and minimize holding costs, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods and using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (P16-P20). The high on-hand balance will trigger the OR backend to place zero orders until the pipeline inventory falls below the computed base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16: avg demand further stabilized at ~44 units/period (based on P16-P20), representing a major sustained drop from previous levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-230.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant and sustained decrease. Initially averaging ~110 units, then dropping to ~75 units starting Period 12, it has further declined to an average of ~44 units per period since Period 16 (P16-P21 demand: 38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59). Currently, on-hand inventory is 289 units with no units in-transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (289 units) relative to the new demand regime (~44 units/period), the current stock covers over 6 periods of demand (5 + L). The OR backend's base-stock target (base_stock = (1+L) * mu) with L=4 and mu\u224844 would be roughly 220 units. Since on-hand + in-transit (289 + 0) already exceeds this target, the system will correctly place zero orders to allow inventory to deplete, minimizing the high holding costs ($1/unit). Parameter selection focuses on the most recent 6-period regime (P16-P21) to ensure the backend accurately reflects this lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is confirmed at an average of ~46 units/period (based on P16-P21), appearing stable at this lower level.

The average demand over the last 7 periods (P16-P22) is 48.1 units. The most recent three periods (P20, P21, P22) show very consistent demand at 58, 59, and 57 respectively, suggesting a slight uptick from the immediate post-drop low but still far below historical highs. The on-hand inventory is currently quite high (232 units) relative to this new demand level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and lower demand, the OR backend needs to recognize the current low-demand regime to avoid over-ordering. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime starting at Period 16, and use a calculated lead time since it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 has stabilized at a higher sub-level: the last 3 periods (P20-P22) show consistent demand near 58 units, compared to the P16-P19 average of ~40 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a significant drop around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P20 to P23), demand has been consistent: 58, 59, 57, and 72. This yields an average of approximately 61.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 160 units, and there are 8 units in transit. Given the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00 each), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5 (50%), meaning we should avoid overstocking. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current stable sub-regime (P20-P23) and 'calculate' for lead time since it has been reliable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized at a higher sub-level of approximately 61 to 62 units/period, compared to the previous low of 46 units/period (P16-P19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a recovery phase following a significant drop. After hitting a low average of ~46 units (P16-P19), the demand has trended upwards over the last 5 periods (P20-P24), averaging approximately 67.8 units/period (58, 59, 57, 72, 93). The most recent period (P24) showed a notable jump to 93 units. Given this upward trend, I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 (P20-P24) to capture this rising demand regime while filtering out the extremely low outliers from the previous dip. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by consistent 4-period arrival cycles in the history. The stock on hand (67) plus in-transit (82) totals 149 units, which is approximately 2.2 times the recent average demand (67.8). To maintain a proper buffer for a (L+1)=5 period lead time protection, additional ordering is likely necessary via the OR backend. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated to reflect the current 5-period regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 20: demand is recovering from a low of ~46 to a recent 5-period average of ~68 units/period (P20-P24), with a peak of 93 in P24.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been volatile, with a significant drop between Periods 16-22, followed by a recovery phase starting Period 23. While Period 25 saw a sharp, unexpected drop to 27 units, the previous five periods (P20-P24) averaged approximately 68 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 40 units, and there are 176 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, and P25). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, meaning the order placed in P23 will arrive in P27. Given the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. To capture the recent recovery while acknowledging the P25 dip, I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat (P20-P25, average ~61) to smooth the volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 6 to reflect the current high variance. L is set to default (4).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P25: 27, P26: 35) suggests that the temporary peak observed in P24 (93) was an outlier rather than a sustained recovery. The demand regime starting around Period 20 has been volatile, with an average of approximately 57 units (P20-P26: 58, 59, 57, 72, 93, 27, 35). Given the current on-hand inventory of 5 units and a pipeline of 265 units (orders from P23, P24, P25, P26), and a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we are in a replenishment phase. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the average since Period 20 (~57.3 units) and 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (std ~23 units) caused by the outlier in P24. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 20 stabilized at an average of ~57 units/period with significant volatility (std ~23). The P24 peak of 93 was not sustained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized around a mean of 58.3 units (P20-P27: 58, 59, 57, 72, 93, 27, 35, 63), though volatility is significant (standard deviation approx 22). In Period 27, an order from Period 23 arrived (lead time 4), but the on-hand inventory was exhausted (sold 13 out of 63 demanded), resulting in a stockout. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 with 274 units in transit. The in-transit inventory covers approximately 4.7 cycles of current average demand (274 / 58.3). I will use L=4 (consistent with history) and a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable but volatile lower-demand regime (P20-P27) that is higher than the P16-P19 low. This helps the OR backend maintain a safety stock that accounts for recent volatility while recognizing the lower average compared to early game peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 20 stabilized at an average of ~58 units/period (P20-P27 data), higher than the previous trough but lower than early game averages.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 29, the demand environment remains in the regime established around Period 20. The average demand since Period 20 (9 samples) is approximately 56.1 units. While there was a peak of 93 in Period 24, most subsequent observations (27, 35, 63, 41) support a lower mean than the early-game average. Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat captures this current regime (P20-P28). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent, confirmed by the arrival of orders placed in P23 and P24 exactly 4 periods later. Pipeline inventory (216) is substantial relative to recent demand, which will likely result in a very small or zero order from the OR backend. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=9 period to reflect current volatility (std ~22).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level compared to the beginning of the game. Since Period 20, the average demand is approximately 58 units (sum of P20-P29 demand is 572). The most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) have an average demand of 46.6 units, reflecting significant volatility (ranging from 27 to 93 in the P20-P29 window). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods (P23, P24, and P25 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently 60, with 154 units in transit (orders from P26, P27, P28, and P29). These in-transit units are expected to arrive in Periods 30, 31, 32, and 33. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5. To find the optimal base stock (1+L) * mean, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 20, which is more representative of current conditions than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 20 is stabilized at an average of ~57 units/period (P20-P29). Lead time is reliably 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 57 units/period since Period 20, despite some volatility (std ~23). The most recent demand observations (P27: 63, P28: 41, P29: 67, P30: 61) support this stabilized level. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed consistently by recent arrivals (P27-P30 arrivals all matched a 4-period lead time). Currently, on-hand inventory is 88 units and there are 137 units in-transit. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock level (target pipeline) needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using a mean of 57 units/period, the expected demand over 5 periods is 285. My current total inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 225. I will set the parameters to reflect this recent stable regime starting from Period 20 (N=11) to allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate service level while accounting for the observed demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 57 units/period since Period 20, following significant fluctuations earlier in the session. Calculating the average demand from Period 20 to Period 31 (inclusive) confirms a mean of 57.75 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory status shows 48 units on-hand and 183 units in-transit. Given a lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline inventory involves covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Summing recent demand provides a robust forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimate. I will use recent_N with N=12 (P20-P31) to capture this stable regime, which effectively balances the service level for a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting roughly the 50th percentile of demand).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P20-P32) has stabilized at an average of approximately 57 units per period. In the last period (P32), demand was 70, which resulted in a stockout since the arriving shipment (16 units) plus the starting on-hand (48 units) was insufficient. Currently, there is 0 inventory on-hand, and 224 units in-transit. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (std dev ~23) and the current stockout situation, I will set mu_hat using the recent 13-period average (P20 onwards) to reflect this stabilized regime. I will use a larger N for sigma_hat to capture the observed volatility across this period. This approach aims to restore inventory levels to meet the stabilized, albeit noisy, demand level and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized around an average of 57-60 units/period (P20-P33 average is ~58.3). However, recent periods P32 and P33 have resulted in stockouts due to high in-transit levels and low on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a significant demand of 56-70 in the last two periods, parameters must be set to recover inventory levels. I will use the last 14 periods (P20-P33) for demand statistics to capture this stable but volatile lower regime. Period 33 demand was 56, and Period 32 was 70. Using recent_N with N=14 will target the average of ~58 units/period, providing a robust base for the OR backend to calculate the appropriate order to replenish stock given the 4-period lead time.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 57 units/period since Period 20, though recent volatility is notable (last 5 periods: 57, 70, 56, 45). The current on-hand inventory is 27 units, and the pipeline inventory is 220 units (orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Over the last 15 periods (P20-P34), the average demand is 56.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this post-drop stability while smoothing out recent spikes like the 70 in P32 and the 45 in P34. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand while managing the high relative holding cost (Holding=Profit=1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 20 remains stable at an average of ~56 units/period (P20-P34). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods.

The last 5 periods (P31-P35) show demands of 57, 70, 56, 45, 52, which averages 56. Lead time has been perfectly reliable at 4 periods throughout the game history. On-hand inventory is 38 units, and in-transit inventory is 197 units (ordered P32-P35). Current total pipeline (235) covers approximately 4.2 periods of mean demand.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable at approximately 56-57 units/period since Period 20, though recent volatility is noted (e.g., 108 in Period 36, 45-52 in 34-35). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 191 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high demand of 108 in Period 36 and the stockout, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture this potential upward drift or increased volatility, while maintaining the base stock level to cover 5 periods (L+1). I'll choose N=17 (from Period 20 onwards) as the regime anchor for mu_hat, but I'll monitor if the Period 36 peak of 108 is a one-off or a shift. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=17 to capture the increased standard deviation observed since Period 20 (approx 23 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant upward shift starting around Period 36. After a long period of stability (P20-P35) where demand averaged ~56 units, the last two periods recorded demand levels of 108 (P36) and 149 (P37). This suggests a new high-demand regime, likely seasonal or event-driven, which requires a proactive adjustment to prevent stockouts, as evidenced by the zero ending inventory in P36 and P37. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To capture this surge, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 periods (approx 103 units/period) projected over (L+1) periods (5 periods total), resulting in 515. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat set to a higher value (approx 45 per period, scaled by sqrt(L+1)) to account for the increased volatility observed during this spike.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge starting Period 36: average demand increased from ~56 units to ~128 units over P36-P37 (+128%). Inventory levels are currently insufficient to meet this new peak.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significant growth phase starting at Period 36. Demand values for the last three periods (P36-P38) are 108, 149, and 130, averaging ~129 units per period. This is an increase of over 100% from the previous stable average of ~56. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to the unexpected surge. To ensure the OR backend reacts sufficiently to this new regime and avoids further lost sales during the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand cluster. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to account for the increased volatility observed during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand from P36-P38 is ~129 units/period, compared to the previous average of ~56 (+130%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-activity regime starting Period 36, likely due to a seasonal peak or calendar event. Demand over the last four periods (P36-P39) has averaged 139.75 units (108, 149, 130, 172), which is more than double the previous stable average of ~56 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts. Although 484 units are in-transit, the immediate priority is to set parameters that reflect this sustained demand spike. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the sharp and sustained increase over the last 4 periods, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers (1+4) = 5 periods of this high demand while accounting for the high volatility (std dev) observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36: Sustained high demand confirmed with an average of ~140 units/period (P36-P39), a significant increase from the previous long-term average of ~56.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 36, jumping from a long-term average of ~56 to a high-demand phase. Over the last 5 periods (P36-P40), individual demand observations were 108, 149, 130, 172, and 186. This averages to 149 units per period, with a clear upward trend (the most recent three periods average 162.7). Transitioning to a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat is necessary to capture this surge, as older data is no longer relevant. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P40 saw the P36 order arrive). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 618 units in-transit (orders from P37-P40). Given the current demand level of ~163 and a lead time of 4, the target pipeline inventory (base stock) needs to cover 5 periods of demand (approx 815 units). The parameters are set to aggressive levels to recover from the stockout and match the higher demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 36 has intensified: last 5 periods average 149 units/period, with the most recent 3 periods (P38-P40) averaging 162.7 units, indicating an upward trend within the high-demand phase.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 36. The last 6 periods (P36-P41) have shown a significant surge with demand values of 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, and 137, averaging approximately 147 units per period. The most recent 3 periods average 165 units, suggesting volatility remains high but the level is sustained. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 652 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture this high-demand regime (N=6), which calculates the base stock to cover (1+L) periods. This will help the OR backend adjust the inventory level to meet the higher demand while the pipeline replenishes.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime since Period 36 confirmed: Average demand is ~147 units/period (P36-P41), a ~160% increase from the previous average of ~56.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 36. Examining the demand from P36 to P42: 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125. This yields an average of approximately 143.8 units/period. The most recent three periods (P40-P42) show 186, 137, and 125, averaging ~149.3. There is a slight moderation observed in the last two periods (137, 125), but demand remains high compared to the pre-P36 average of ~56. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting L to default (4). Setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this post-P36 high-demand regime specifically. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P36-P42) average demand calculated at 144 units/period, with volatility (std) significantly higher than previous regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 36. Since P36, the observed demand values are 108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, and 132. The average demand for this high-demand regime (P36-P43, N=8) is approximately 142.4 units per period. The standard deviation has also increased due to higher volatility in the high-demand phase. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P42 and P43 which were ordered in P38 and P39). For Period 44, I am using recent_N with N=8 to capture this specific high-demand regime. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on the sustained trend since the surge began, allowing the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) to prevent backorders while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime since Period 36: Average demand is approximately 142.4 units/period (P36-P43), which is a significant sustained increase from the previous long-term average of ~56.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 is firmly established at a significantly higher level compared to previous periods. Analyzing the demand from Period 36 to Period 44 (9 samples), the mean is 143.67 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 26.5. Although recent periods show some fluctuation (P41: 137, P42: 125, P43: 132, P44: 154), the overall average remains steady near 144. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand environment while accounting for the observed volatility. The current pipeline (444 units) plus on-hand (114 units) totaling 558 units is being compared against a target base stock geared for (1+L)=5 periods of demand (~720 units), keeping inventory moving to meet the sustained high demand.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 has been high, averaging approximately 142 units per period (P36-P43 average: 142.4). However, Period 45 showed a significant drop to 80 units. While one data point is not enough to confirm a new regime shift (especially given the volatility: std ~35), it warrants cautious parameter selection. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 161 and 478 units in-transit (arriving P46-P49), the pipeline is relatively full. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent high-demand phase (P36-P45) while slightly weighting the more recent lower observation. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the recent high-volatility period (N=10). This strategy aims to maintain service levels for the high-demand regime while remaining responsive to potential cooling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-50.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting in Period 36 has shown high volume with significant fluctuations. While the average demand from P36 to P46 is approximately 131 units, the last two periods (P45-P46) have shown a slight cooling to an average of 88.5 units. However, given the extreme volatility and previous peaks nearing 190, I must maintain a robust mu_hat while adjusting for the most recent data to avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods of the game (ending P50). Period 47 is close to the horizon; the lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, the primary goal is to manage the current on-hand (147) and in-transit (443) inventory efficiently. Total pipeline is 590 units. With an average demand over the last 11 periods of ~131, we have enough inventory to cover ~4.5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full scope of this high-demand regime while allowing the backend to factor in the recent lower samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 (high demand) shows signs of cooling/volatility: P36-P44 average was ~142, but P45-P46 dropped to an average of 88.5. Global average for this regime (P36-P46) is ~131 units/period.

Daily Profit: $140.00, Daily Holding Cost: $117.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand regime since Period 36. Although the Carry-over Insights for Period 47 noted a slight cooling (avg 88.5 for P45-P46), Period 47 itself saw a bounce back to 140 units. Over the entire high-demand period (P36-P47), the average demand is approximately 131.75 units with a standard deviation of 31.2. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), and given that an order placed in P48 will arrive in P52 (outside the simulation window), the focus shifts to utilizing existing 'In-transit' inventory (412 units) and current 'On-hand' inventory (117 units) to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing holding costs. Since the total remaining expected demand for P48, P49, and P50 at the current regime average (~132/period) is approximately 396 units, and total current inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 529 units, we already have sufficient cover. However, to maintain the backend logic's safety stocks against potential demand spikes in the final periods, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the high-demand regime (last 12 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 49, we are in a high-demand regime that started at Period 36. Although there was a brief dip around Period 45-46, the most recent data (P47-P48) shows demand returning to significant levels (140, 152). The average demand since Period 36 is approximately 135 units/period. On-hand inventory is 89, and in-transit is 430. The game is nearing its end (Period 50), so the standard (L+1) coverage window is less critical than managing the final stock arrival. However, given the lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now in P49 will not arrive before the game ends (it would arrive in Period 53). Consequently, the current pipeline is what will satisfy the remaining demand. I will set parameters based on the sustained high-demand regime using recent_N (N=13, covering P36-P48) to reflect the high mean and volatility observed in this phase, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock relative to the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 remains high despite recent volatility, with P47-P48 reverting to >140 units/period. Average for this regime (P36-P48) is ~135 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 36 remains high and volatile. While there was a brief cooling in Periods 45-46 (averaging 88.5), demand has rebounded in Periods 47-49 (averaging 144). The overall average for this high-demand regime (P36-P49) is approximately 135.4 units/period with a standard deviation around 30. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals from Period 41 through 45. To balance the $1 profit vs. $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level), I am setting mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods using the mean of the current high-demand regime (14 samples from P36 to P49). I am using recent_N with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the specific volatility of this current regime.
