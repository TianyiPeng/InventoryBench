Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Strategy: Ensure supply for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean of ~97, total expected demand over 5 periods is ~485 units. OR Logic Reflection: The OR recommendation of 132 units is likely the capped quantity (\u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + 1.645 * \u03c3\u0302/\u221a(1+L)). Specifically, it targets a single-period replenishment to stay near base stock without over-ordering. Since we are starting from 0, the total pipeline needed is \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 (~550-600 units) to cover the 4-period lead time delay.

Demand has averaged 102 units over the last 40 periods, though it spikes occasionally (e.g., 256 in P35). With 659 units in the pipeline against a remaining 10 periods of demand (~1000 units), we need more inventory to cover the lead time (L=4). The OR recommendation of 2 units is extremely low because it likely misinterprets the high pipeline versus its internal estimation of recent demand/base stock.

Current on-hand is 233. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 481. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 100 units. With 5 periods remaining (46, 47, 48, 49, 50), total expected demand is roughly 500 units. The OR baseline recommends 163 units based on safety stock calculations. However, we must be careful not to overstock as we approach the end of the game (Period 50) to minimize holding costs. Any order placed now (P46) will arrive in P50. Any order placed in P47 or later will arrive after the game ends. Therefore, this is likely our last or second-to-last meaningful order. Total demand for P46-P50 is ~500. Current total inventory is 481. An order of ~20-50 units would cover the gap, but the OR recommendation of 163 is quite high given the remaining periods.

Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with a recent 5-period average of approximately 89 units (Periods 42-46). The current on-hand inventory is 221 units, and there are 246 units in-transit (orders from Periods 43, 44, and 46). Specifically, the pipeline consists of 94 (P43), 92 (P44), 0 (P45), and 60 (P46). Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 467 units. With lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. At an average demand of ~90-100 units, the total requirement is 450-500 units. The OR recommendation of 162 units is significantly higher than usual because it likely perceives the zero-order in P45 as a gap in the pipeline. However, we are near the end of the game (Period 47 of 50). Orders placed now will arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends), as lead time is 4 periods (P47 decision -> arrival resolution in P51). Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs and provide no revenue. I will set the order quantity to 0.",
