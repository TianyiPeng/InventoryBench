The product is a standard snack item (Regular chips), which typically has stable demand unless impacted by specific events. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods to ensure continuity, as the first order placed today (Period 1) will not arrive until Period 5's arrival phase and become usable in Period 6. Total demand to cover for 5 periods is approximately 5 * 96.8 = 484 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. My goal is to establish a pipeline that meets this expected demand while accounting for potential lead time variance.",

The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My decision logic follows the (L+1) period inventory coverage (4+1=5 periods). Total requirement for 5 periods @ 110/period is 550 units. Currently, On-hand (220) + In-transit (455) = 675 units. The pipeline is full due to recent aggressive ordering (146 in P43, 109 in P42). Specifically, the expected arrivals are: P44 (from P40: 100), P45 (from P41: 100), P46 (from P42: 109), and P47 (from P43: 146). Adding these to the current on-hand of 220 brings the total available units to cover the next 4-5 periods well above the 550 unit target. To avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods of the game (ending at P50), I will place a minimal order to gradually draw down the surplus inventory while maintaining a safe service level.",

For Period 45, we are in the endgame (Period 45 of 50). Our goal is to cover demand for the remaining periods while minimizing ending inventory. The pipeline currently consists of: On-hand (216), Arrival P45 (ordered P41: 100), Arrival P46 (ordered P42: 109), Arrival P47 (ordered P43: 146), and Arrival P48 (ordered P44: 0). Total inventory available through P48 is 216 + 100 + 109 + 146 = 571 units. Demand for the 6 remaining periods (P45-P50) at a mean of 110/period is approximately 660 units. Total inventory needed to cover until the end of the game is 660. Current on-hand + in-transit is 216 + 355 = 571 units. To reach 660, I need an additional 89 units. Since this is Period 45 and lead time is 4, an order placed now (P45) arrives in P49, perfectly covering the final 2 periods (P49 and P50). I will order 100 units to ensure safety against small spikes while moving toward a clean inventory exit.",

Looking at the remaining timeframe (P46 to P50), there are only 5 periods left. My current total inventory (602) covers roughly 5.5 to 6 periods of demand at the current rate (~105 units/period). An additional order now (P46) would arrive in P50 (the final period). Given that I already have enough units to cover demand until the end of the game (105 * 5 = 525 needed vs 602 available), and the objective is to maximize reward (Profit - Holding Costs), ordering more would only increase holding costs without increasing sales. Therefore, I will place an order of 0 to optimize the ending inventory for the final periods.",

Given the lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now in Period 47 will arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4 = 51), which is after the simulation ends.
