Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The initial on-hand inventory is 0, and there are no units in transit. High demand is observed in the provided samples (avg ~96.8), so we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods of demand). Using all 5 available samples to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the most stable starting point. Since profit is $4 and holding cost is $1, the critical ratio is high (0.8), justifying a higher safety stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 132 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4 periods. As per the game mechanics, even if the actual lead time were 0 or 1, we would not see an arrival in the 'Period 1 conclude' message because arrivals happen AFTER the decision phase. Since the promised lead time is 4, we expect this order to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start message. Initial demand (Period 1: 120) is consistent with the provided 5-period historical sample mean (~96.8). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), a high service level is preferred. Since we have no confirmed deviations in lead time or demand regime yet, I will use 'default' methods which utilize the available historical samples (including Period 1 demand) and the promised lead time of 4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (132 units) and Period 2 (136 units) are currently in-transit (total 268 units). Inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for the first two periods because the lead time is greater than 0. Since we only have historical demand for 2 periods (120 and 90, average 105) and the seed data (71, 120, 95, 116, 82, average 96.8), the demand seems relatively stable around the 100 mark. I will use the 'default' method for lead time (4) and demand stats to allow the OR backend to establish a baseline. Since L=4, the base stock will target covering 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (N=1) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (N+L = 1+4) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Consequently, no arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (In-transit) contains 400 units (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand history shows samples of 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 (if we include the current inferred demand from history) or specifically 120, 90, 102 from the game history logs. The average demand across these samples is approximately 97. Since there are no detected shifts in demand regime or lead time arrivals yet, I will use the default methods for all parameters. This tells the OR backend to use all available samples and the promised lead time of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 530 units in-transit). Following the lead time definition: an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 arrives during Period 5's arrival phase and becomes visible in Period 5's conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand is 0 and we have had stockouts for Periods 1-4 because no inventory has arrived yet. This is expected given the lead time. Demand history (samples provided: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82) shows a mean of approximately 96.8. The game history demand (120, 90, 102, 72) for periods 1-4 is slightly lower, averaging 96. I will use the default methods for now as we are waiting for the first delivery to confirm actual lead time and we have no evidence of a regime shift yet. L=4 remains the best estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $453.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (arrived during Period 5 arrival resolution), confirming the promised lead time L=4. In-transit inventory is 398 (Orders from P2, P3, P4). Demand over the first 5 periods was 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 (per Historical Demand Data) or 120, 90, 102, 72, 117 (per Conclude messages). Given the discrepancy, I will follow the demand reported in the conclude messages for the actual game execution. Mean demand is approx 100 units/period. The current on-hand is low (15), but we have staggered arrivals expected in Periods 6, 7, and 8. I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'default' for mu and sigma to allow the backend to use the full historical sample set as we are in a relatively stable demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $159.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival of Period 1's order in Period 5 and Period 2's order in Period 6. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been [120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62], resulting in a mean of ~93.8. Including the pre-game samples [71, 120, 95, 116, 82], the overall mean is 93.4. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility (mean ~92, std ~23) while relying on the backend to handle the (1+L) scaling. Lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $394.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical evidence from Period 5, 6, and 7 confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current demand shows no significant regime shift; fluctuations (72 to 123) are within expected variance for this category. Average demand over the first 7 periods is approximately 98 units per period. With L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods (L+1). Target inventory level is roughly 5 * 98 = 490 units. Current pipeline (on-hand 98 + in-transit 293) is 391 units, leaving a gap. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed lead times are consistent. For demand and volatility, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture the full observed history while being responsive to the established mean.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of historical arrivals (P5-P8) confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history for Period 1-8 shows a mean of approximately 101 units with a standard deviation around 22. Incorporating the user-provided pre-game samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) with the in-game history (120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123, 122), we see a relatively stable but fluctuating demand pattern. Given L=4, the coverage period (L+1) is 5. We have 106 units on-hand and 301 in-transit (Total pipeline = 407). Average demand over 5 periods is roughly 500 units. The OR backend will calculate the base stock level and place an order to bridge the gap. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the 4-period lead time is consistent, and 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters to capture the most relevant in-game demand volatility while ignoring the pre-game seed data which appears slightly different in variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history: Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). The order from Period 5 was for 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' in Period 9 (P5+4). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 442 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand (P1-P9) averages 102.1 units with a standard deviation of 22.0. The recent order pattern suggests the OR backend is already attempting to maintain a base stock. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time since it is stable at 4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'default' method (all samples) to establish a stable baseline, as the demand fluctuates between 62 and 123 without a clear regime shift or strong seasonality yet visible in the period numbers provided.

Daily Reward (R_t): $438.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable across the first 10 periods, with an average demand of approximately 100 units (94.9 average). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). However, the order from Period 5 (which was for 0 units) resulted in no arrivals during Period 9, causing a stockout where 106/109 demand was met. Currently, there is an In-transit balance of 424 units (Orders from P7: 46, P8: 138, P9: 141, P10: 99), which aligns with the 4-period lead time. Since the demand shows no significant regime shift, I will use the last 10 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock for (L+1) = 5 periods. With L=4 and average demand ~100, the target pipeline inventory is roughly 500 units. Since on-hand + in-transit is 430, the system should trigger a replenishment order of approximately 70-100 units to cover the next cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11). There was a skipped arrival in Period 9 (no order was placed in Period 5, which explains the zero arrival in Period 9 based on L=4). However, current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 9 and 11. Demand is relatively stable. Across all 11 periods of history (plus 5 initialization samples), the mean demand is approximately 100 units/period (History average: 102.1 units/period). To recover from the current stockout and maintain a high service level given the profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use the established lead time L=4 and calculate the demand forecast across the (L+1)=5 period horizon using the full sample history. The OR backend will use these to determine the base stock level (approximately 500+ units) and place orders to fill the gap considering the 503 units currently in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $377.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12). Current inventory status shows on-hand=35 and in-transit=403. Detailed analysis of arrivals: Period 9 had 0 arrivals because 0 units were ordered in Period 5. The order from Period 9 (141 units) is expected to arrive during Period 13 resolution, raising the ending inventory for Period 13 before the customer demand occurs. Historical demand samples (including the initial seed and game history) show a stable pattern: Seeds (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) and History (120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123, 122, 109, 111, 96, 103). The mean demand over 17 observations is approximately 99.4. No recent regime shift is detected, so I will use a slightly more responsive recent_N (N=8) to capture any subtle trends in the recent history (approx mean 104.5). Lead time L is stable at 4.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 95.3 units. Visual inspection of the demand history (71, 120, 95, 116, 82, 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123, 122, 109, 111, 96, 103, 81) suggests a stable demand regime without significant seasonal shifts or trends. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and P9 all arrived with lead_time=4). There are currently 389 units in transit (orders from P10, P11, P12, P13), which aligns with the 4-period lead time. Because the demand is stable, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the full recent history since the start of the simulation, and 'calculate' for L to use the observed stable lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a mean around 102. Demand samples show moderate variance without any obvious seasonal shifts or regime changes. The current on-hand inventory is 74, and there are 346 units in-transit. Comparing the game history to the promised lead time of 4 periods, we observe that orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10 all arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time. However, the order from Period 5 (which was size 0) appeared as an arrived=0 event in P9 conclude. This confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. Since no demand regime shift is detected, I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering 1+L = 5 periods of demand) remains robust against the observed volatility (std ~19-20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16. The demand history shows a mean of approximately 99 units per period (last 10 periods average is 98.9). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as corroborated by the carry-over insight and recent arrivals (P6 through P15 arrivals all show L=4). However, an order placed in Period 5 was never delivered (it should have arrived in Period 9 conclusion, but arrived=0 was reported). This missing shipment caused stockouts in P9 and P11. Currently, on-hand is 97 and in-transit is 359. The pipeline (456 units) covers roughly 4.6 periods of demand (456/99), which is nearly the desired coverage for L+1 (5 periods). Using recent_N=10 for demand statistics captures the current regime while filtering the noisy start. Since lead time is stable at 4, 'calculate' is appropriate to maintain the 4-period lead time assumption in the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment ordered in Period 5 failed to arrive (confirmed lost/skipped). Lead time for all other successful shipments remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the average demand is approximately 102.5 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. The promised lead time is 4, and historical observations confirm the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P5 through P16, with the exception of the lost P5 order). For Period 17, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the most representative recent demand distribution. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the observed 4-period fulfillment cycle. Current pipeline inventory (416 units) and on-hand inventory (77 units) are being balanced against an expected demand over the lead time + current period (L+1=5 periods).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows a significant spike in Period 17 (151 units), compared to the recent average. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the average demand is 102.4. Over the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the average is 105.3. Given the recent spike, I will use a slightly more responsive approach for mu_hat but maintain the stable lead time estimate. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple historical arrivals (P13, P14, P15, P16, P17 all arrived with L=4). The in-transit inventory of 347 units represents orders from P14 (56), P15 (138), P16 (95), and P17 (58). No new shipment losses have been detected since the P5 loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $386.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 19. The actual lead time L=4 is well-confirmed by consistent history (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6-P14 orders all arrived with L=4). P5 was lost. Historical demand samples (including pre-game and game history) show a stable pattern despite some variance. Average demand over the 18 active periods is approximately 102 units. The current on-hand inventory is low (10 units), and the pipeline (In-transit: 438 units) includes orders from P15 (138), P16 (95), P17 (58), and P18 (147). The order from P15 is expected to arrive during this period (Period 19) and will be reflected in the next period's report. To maintain appropriate stock levels covering L+1 (5 periods) of demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most representative recent demand volatility while keeping L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from Period 1 through 15, excluding the lost shipment from Period 5). The current on-hand inventory is 42 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 413 units. The demand over the last 19 periods has been relatively stable, with no clear seasonality or regime shift detected, though there is inherent volatility. Mean demand over the full history (19 periods) is approximately 101.4 units/period, while the most recent 10-period mean is 103.5 units/period. Given the promised lead time (L=4) and the need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods, the OR backend's capped base-stock policy will be used. I will use the 'default' lead time method since the 4-period lead time is stable and aligns with the promised value. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture a robust yet relevant sample of recent demand (Period 6 onwards, after the initial start-up/lost order noise) to ensure the base stock is calculated against current demand levels while smoothing out individual period spikes.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with no clear evidence of shifts. Over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), mean demand is 104.2 and standard deviation is approximately 25. Actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, confirmed across all successful shipments. The order from Period 5 remains lost. Pipeline inventory is healthy (425 units), ensuring that upcoming arrivals will meet demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the most relevant demand variability while filtering out the volatile early periods. L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed actual lead time of 4.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 102 units per period over the last 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 21. There is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 500 units, which reflects orders placed in Periods 18, 19, 20, and 21. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the 147 units ordered in Period 18 are expected to arrive during Period 22. Given the previous lost shipment in Period 5/9, I am monitoring the pipeline closely, but as recent arrivals (Periods 19-21) have been consistent with a 4-period lead time, I will maintain L=4. I'll use a recent window (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains relatively stable with no clear evidence of a regime shift or significant seasonality. The average demand across all historical samples (Periods 1-23) is approximately 101 units per period, while the last 10 periods average roughly 102.4 units. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat as the backend's calculation using all samples is robust given the lack of detected changepoints. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals), so I will use the 'default' method for L. The pipeline (In-transit: 411) plus On-hand (103) total 514 units, which is slightly above the expected (L+1) demand of ~505 units, but within a reasonable safety stock range for a high-profit (4:1 profit/holding ratio) item to prevent stockouts.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable around an average of 100 units per period (last 10 periods average is 98.3, last 5 periods average is 88.6). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 127 and in-transit is 336. The total pipeline (463) covers approximately 4.6 periods of demand. Given the lead time of 4 periods and the decision occurring at the start of Period 25, we need to cover demand for Periods 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 (L+1 = 5 periods). A base stock for 5 periods at an average of 100/period would be 500 units. The current total inventory (463) is slightly below this target. Using the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is stable at the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations (like the dip to 57 in P23 and 83 in P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable, with a recent 10-period mean of approximately 99 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the most recent arrival in Period 25 (ordered Period 21). The shipment from Period 5 is still confirmed lost, and all other pipeline inventory is accounted for within the 4-period window. On-hand inventory is 117, and in-transit inventory is 285 (orders from P22, P23, P24, P25). This pipeline (285) plus on-hand (117) equals 402 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will continue using 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand and volatility to capture the most stable recent performance while ignoring the start-up phase and any very early demand fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 22 to 26 has been 100, 57, 83, 143, and 83. The mean demand of these 5 periods is 93.2, which is slightly lower than the overall mean of approximately 100. However, volatility remains significant (std \u2248 32). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P20-P22 orders arriving as expected). I will set L to 4 using the calculate method. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use the recent_N method with N=15 to balance between capturing recent demand trends and maintaining enough stability to handle the inherent variance in 'chips(Regular)' sales. This N=15 covers periods 12-26, which represents the most stable recent history since the lost shipment in the early game. This configuration aims to maintain sufficient safety stock for a SKU with high volatility and a 4-period lead time, while avoiding excessive holding costs given the current on-hand inventory of 106.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown high variability with periods of high demand (e.g., P27: 121, P25: 143) balanced by lower periods (P26: 83). The average demand over the last 15 periods (since roughly Period 13) is approximately 101.4 units, which is consistent with the long-term average. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P25, P26, and P27). My inventory position is currently 435 (84 on-hand + 351 in-transit). With a lead time of 4, our 'at-risk' period is L+1 = 5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~507 units. Since 435 < 507, the backend will place an order to reach the base stock level. I am using 'recent_N' with N=15 for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the stable but noisy regime observed since the mid-game, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a standard safety buffer for the 80% service level implied by the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is low (9 units) as we enter Period 29. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P25-P28). The promised lead time is also 4, so L is set to 'default'. Demand for chips(Regular) has been stable. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 14), the average demand is approximately 104 units per period with a standard deviation of about 25. Given the service level target (critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), the OR backend needs parameters that reflect this stable but slightly volatile demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the mean and variance of this recent stable regime, ensuring the pipeline (439 units) and new order correctly target a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand (~520 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 103 units per period across the entire history (Periods 1-29). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, despite one lost shipment earlier in the game. In Period 29, we experienced a stockout (on-hand 0, sold 91 against demand of 156), partly due to a higher-than-average demand spike and the timing of arrivals. Since we have 480 units in-transit (covering orders from Period 26, 27, 28, and 29), and the expected arrival for Period 30 would be the order from Period 26 (155 units), the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture recent variability (specifically the spike in Period 29), with N=20 to ensure a robust sample that reflects the stable but volatile nature of the product. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $595.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend, with the last 6 periods averaging approximately 125 units compared to the overall historical average of ~104. Specifically, Periods 25-30 saw demands of 143, 83, 121, 107, 156, and 150. This suggests a potential regime shift or seasonal peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this higher mean (~126.6 per period). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 25-30). Although 'On-hand' is low (5 units), 'In-transit' is 422 units, which covers nearly 3.3 periods of the new higher demand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1=5) periods, approximately 633 units, and subtract the pipeline (427 total), resulting in an order that bridges the gap while accounting for the recent higher volatility reflected in the sigma calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 25: Average demand increased from ~100 to ~125 units per period (+25%).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 25 is confirmed, with demand increasing from ~100 to ~125. However, Period 31 recorded 0 demand, which is a significant outlier compared to the surrounding periods (P29: 156, P30: 150). This drop to 0 might be a data reporting anomaly or a singular event rather than a new downward regime. I will use recent_N=7 for demand (covering P25-P31) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging the recent outlier. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 87, and in-transit is 514, which roughly covers the expected demand for the next 4-5 periods (at ~125/period). Using L=4 and recent_N for both mu and sigma allows the OR backend to adjust to the higher mean and increased volatility of the current regime.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 25 is confirmed, with demand averaging approximately 125 units (excluding the anomalous zero in Period 31). However, Period 31 (demand=0) and Period 32 (demand=71) suggest a potential cooling or high volatility in this new regime. To balance the inventory against the promised 4-period lead time (effective coverage needed for 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the higher demand levels seen since P25 while acknowledging the recent dips. Sigma_hat is set using N=8 to reflect the increased volatility (from 156 down to 0). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history since the single lost shipment in Period 9.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting around Period 25 continues, though recent variability is high (Period 31 had 0 demand, but Periods 30, 32, and 33 showed 150, 71, and 107 respectively). On average, the post-Period 25 demand is approximately 114 units (excluding the zero-demand outlier). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (Periods 28-33). I will use a recent_N of 9 for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the higher mean and volatility of this current regime since Period 25, while including enough samples to smooth the Period 31 outlier. L is set to default as the actual lead time aligns with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 35. Reviewing the demand history, a shift was identified around Period 25 where the average demand increased to approximately 125 units. However, recent periods (31-34) show a significant drop and high volatility (demands of 0, 71, 107, 42), resulting in a recent mean closer to 80-90. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat accommodates the higher demand regime from P25 while factoring in the recent volatility. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding the P5 loss), so I will use 'calculate' to reflect this consistency. The inventory position (On-hand: 207, In-transit: 364) is robust, and the parameters aim to maintain a safety stock that balances the high demand spikes against the recent low demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $899.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a regime shift starting around Period 25. While the Carry-over insight estimated a shift to ~125, the demand in Period 35 spiked massively to 256. Analysis of periods 25-35 (excluding the anomalous 0 in Period 31) shows an average demand of approximately 127 units. The 0 in Period 31 and 256 in Period 35 suggest significantly higher volatility than the earlier periods. To account for this higher mean and volatility while protecting against stockouts, I will use a recent_N window of 11 (covering the regime change start from Period 25 to 35). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using this recent window (N=11) ensures the OR backend uses the updated mean (~127) and the higher standard deviation reflected in recent samples.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Extreme demand spike observed (256 units). Significant increase in demand volatility confirmed within the new higher-demand regime (Periods 25-35).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift starting at Period 25. Prior to P25, mean demand was ~100. Since P25, excluding the abnormal zero in P31 and the extreme spike in P35, demand has averaged ~120. Period 35's demand of 256 is nearly 2.5 times the historical mean, indicating a sharp increase in volatility. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=12 to capture this shifted regime (Periods 25-36). For sigma_hat, I am using explicit to forcefully account for the heightened volatility observed in the last two periods (256 units in P35 and 120 in P36). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31, P32 arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand is low (50) relative to the new demand level, requiring a robust order to cover the 4-period lead time pipeline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 25 to a higher average (~125), and Period 35 showed a significant spike (256). Since Period 35, demand has remained high (120, 115). I am using recent_N=13 for mu_hat to capture this higher-demand regime starting at P25. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=13 to account for the increased volatility observed in this period, including the extreme spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the historical loss in Period 9 (P5 order). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 555 units in-transit. The OR backend will calculate the order based on the updated mean and variance to ensure adequate service level during this high-demand phase while managing the risk of overstocking given the large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $333.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25 to a higher mean (~125) and significantly higher volatility, particularly evidenced by the 256-unit spike in Period 35. For Period 39, I observe a moderate demand of 87 in Period 38, following the high-demand volatility of the last 14 periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by consecutive arrivals from P31, P32, P33, and P34). Current on-hand inventory is low (15), and there is a robust pipeline (580 units). Given the recent demand regime change and higher volatility, I will use recent_N (N=14, matching the start of the regime shift at Period 25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to ensure the OR backend captures both the elevated mean and the increased risk of spikes (sigma). This helps maintain a high service level for a high-profit item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) while accounting for the recent instability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 25-39) shows an increased average demand of approximately 114 units (excluding the outlier in P31 which was 0 potentially due to a data error, but keeping the spike in P35). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P35-P39) show high volatility and stockouts, with demand values of 256, 120, 115, 87, and 129. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the target service level (80% based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), and the recent volatility, I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture the shift since Period 25, while using N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in the most recent periods. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the elevated demand and provides a buffer against the recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the current regime (P25-P39); mean demand is sustained at approximately 115-125 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, we are operating within a high-demand regime that began around Period 25. The mean demand in this recent regime (Periods 25-40) is approximately 115 units, with significantly increased volatility, including an extreme outlier of 256 in Period 35. The carry-over insights confirm a stable lead time of 4 periods, which is consistent with the latest arrival in Period 40 (ordered P36, arrived P40). On-hand inventory is 99 units, and there is a safe volume of 464 units in-transit. Given the high volatility observed recently, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 to cover the entire duration of the current regime. This ensures the OR backend accounts for both the increased mean and the higher variance when calculating the base stock and order quantity, balancing the risk of stockouts during demand spikes against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 25) shows an average demand of approximately 110-120 units per period, with notable volatility (e.g., P35 spike of 256 units). The most recent demand (Periods 36-41) has averaged ~110 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P40 and P41). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 227 units, with 356 units in-transit. I will use a recent_N approach (N=17, covering the entire new regime from P25 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift in demand mean and the heightened volatility, while sticking to the calculated lead time to ensure the OR backend utilizes the observed stability of L=4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 43. We are in a demand regime that started around Period 25, characterized by higher mean demand (~115-125) and increased volatility. Recent demand samples (P38-P42: 87, 129, 124, 88, 96) show a slight cooling from the extreme spike in P35 but remain consistent with the higher regime average. Carry-over insights confirm the lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 258 units, with 307 units in transit. To set OR parameters, I will use recent_N to capture the current demand regime's characteristics. For L, I use 'default' (4 periods). For mu_hat, I choose recent_N with N=18 (covering the regime from P25 to P42) to provide a stable estimate of the increased mean demand. For sigma_hat, I also choose recent_N with N=18 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed increase in volatility since Period 25, preventing stockouts during potential future spikes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25 to a higher average (~120 units) with increased volatility. Since Period 36, demand has stabilized somewhat but remains higher than the initial phase. Recent demand (P40-P43: 124, 88, 96, 95) shows a slight cooling compared to the P35-P36 spike, averaging 101 units over the last 4 periods. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is healthy (237), and in-transit is 322 units. Total pipeline (559) covers over 5 periods of demand at the current average. To prevent overstocking as we approach the game end (P50) while respecting the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I will use a recent_N window of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current regime's sustained average (~115) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the elevated volatility observed in this regime. Lead time remains 'default' (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 25) shows a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the early periods. While an extreme spike occurred in Period 35 (256 units), the subsequent demand (Periods 36-44) has stabilized around a mean of ~104 units (120, 115, 87, 129, 124, 88, 96, 95, 104). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 180 and 397 units in transit, the current pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime while smoothing out the Period 35 outlier. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock for the (L+1)=5 period horizon while accounting for the observed volatility shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25-44 has a higher mean (~110) and higher volatility compared to P1-P24. One extreme outlier (256 units) occurred in Period 35, but subsequent demand has reverted to the new mean.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 shows an average demand of approximately 110 units, although it remains volatile. Period 45 demand (69 units) was lower than recent averages but within the observed variance of this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from Periods 36-41. Current on-hand inventory is healthy at 219 units, with 355 units in-transit. Given the game is approaching its final periods (P46 of 50), the ordering strategy must ensure coverage for the remaining lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods) while avoiding excessive holding costs at the game's end. I will continue using recent_N (N=20, covering the shift from P25 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's mean (~110) and volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 47/50). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current demand regime (since Period 25) characterized by a higher mean (~110-120) and increased volatility continues. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P42-P46) has slightly moderated (averaging ~82 units), but the volatility remains a factor. Given that the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P47) with a lead time of 4 would arrive in Period 51, which is outside the game's horizon. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters for the current period's logic. I will continue using a lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the characteristics of the second regime (starting P25) while smoothing out the extreme outlier from P35 and incorporating the more recent moderate demand levels. This provides a balanced view of the 'new normal'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand history shows a regime shift that started around Period 25. While there was an extreme spike in Period 35 (256 units), recent demand from Period 40 to 47 has stabilized around a mean of 95 units (88, 96, 95, 104, 69, 74, 96). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P40-P43 orders arriving in P44-P47). On-hand inventory is healthy (216), and the pipeline is well-stocked with 311 units. Given we are near the end of the simulation (P48 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover the remaining 3 periods without over-ordering and incurring holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand level (~95/period) and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility in this regime while tempering the effect of the P35 outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50). The current inventory status shows on-hand inventory of 274 units and in-transit inventory of 189 units (orders from P45, P46, and P47, as P48 had an order of 0). The demand regime since Period 25 has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 110-120 units, despite a significant outlier in Period 35. Recent demand (P45-P48) has been slightly lower (69, 74, 96, 64), but the long-term regime average remains the safer bet for base stock calculations. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand balance relative to the remaining single period of the simulation, the OR engine's capped policy will likely result in a zero or near-zero order to avoid unnecessary holding costs, which is appropriate for the final phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand from Period 45-48 averaged ~76 units, which is lower than the previous P25-44 average (~110). While volatile, the demand appears to be softening or stabilizing at a lower level within the high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $240.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a shift in the recent five periods (P45-P49), averaging 83.8 units compared to the previous high-demand regime (P25-P44) average of ~110. Although the most recent demand in P49 spiked back to 116 units, the preceding four periods were significantly lower (69, 74, 96, 64). I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this softening while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (e.g., P45 order arrived P49). Inventory levels are currently high (On-hand: 224, In-transit: 267), so using a smaller N for volatility (sigma_hat, N=10) helps the OR backend adjust to the recent regime without over-ordering based on the high-variance outlier in Period 35.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 45: average demand decreased from ~110 to ~84 units per period (-24%) while remaining volatile.
