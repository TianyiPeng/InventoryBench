Currently, we have 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The OR algorithm recommends 132 units, which is limited by its smoothing cap. Given that we have zero starting inventory and a long lead time, following a capped recommendation for a single period will leave us significantly exposed to stockouts during the lead-time window. However, since this is Period 1 and we have no observed 'concluded' lead times yet, I will use the OR recommendation as a baseline but recognize that we will need to maintain consistent orders to fill the 4-period pipeline.

Because the game concludes after demand resolution in Period 50, this order will never arrive in time to be sold. My objective is to maximize profit minus holding costs. With 83 units currently on-hand and 263 units already in-transit (specifically: 94 arriving in P48, 104 in P49, 65 in P50), I have a total of 346 units available to satisfy demand for the final three periods (48, 49, and 50). Given recent average demand is approximately 80-100 units, the existing inventory and in-transit units are more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods. Placing an additional order now would only incur potential holding costs without any benefit to revenue, as it cannot arrive before the game ends.",

Therefore, any capital spent on new orders now will result in holding costs or simply wasted expenditure without any possibility of contributing to sales or revenue. The current on-hand inventory is 113 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining two periods (averaging ~100 per period). There is also a substantial pipeline of 169 units already in transit from previous periods that will satisfy any remaining demand if the current stock were to fall short.
