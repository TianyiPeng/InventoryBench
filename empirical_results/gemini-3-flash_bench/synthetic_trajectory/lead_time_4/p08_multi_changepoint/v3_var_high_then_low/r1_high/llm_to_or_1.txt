Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no prior history or demand context beyond the provided 5 samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), I will use all available data to set the initial parameters. The average demand is 96.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 20.3. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, the OR backend needs to place an order to cover the (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand statistics will capture the available baseline variance and mean for this initial decision phase.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 132 units and had a demand of 110. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals have occurred yet, resulting in 0 sales and an ending inventory of 0 for Period 1. The 132 units remain in-transit. Looking at the demand history (samples plus Period 1), the demand values are [71, 120, 95, 116, 82, 110]. The mean is roughly 99. The promised lead time is 4, meaning the order must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for lead time as there is no evidence to suggest a deviation yet. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all available samples (N=6) to establish a baseline, as there is no clear regime shift yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For the first two periods, we have had zero sales because the initial on-hand inventory was zero and the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (132 units) and Period 2 (132 units) are currently 'In-transit' (total 264 units). Based on the promised lead time (L=4), the first order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. The historical demand samples provided (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) average 96.8. However, the actual demand observed in the game history (Period 1: 110, Period 2: 145) suggests the possibility of higher demand or significant volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Since we have only 2 periods of game observation, I will use a mix of historical samples and recent observations to set parameters. L is set to 'default' (4) as no orders have arrived to prove otherwise. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 (blending the 3 most recent historical samples and 2 game observations) to capture the recent higher demand trend. sigma_hat is set to 'default' to accommodate the observed volatility across the total available data pool.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (N=1) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (N+L = 1+4), which will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, which is expected given the lead time. Demand across the first three periods has averaged 122.6 units (110, 145, 113). The historical demand samples provided (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) suggest a mean of 96.8, but actual game history shows slightly higher values. I will use the recent game history (N=3) to set the demand forecast. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover 1+L=5 periods of demand. I will follow the promised lead time until evidence proves otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (132 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 570 units (132+132+151+155). Since no orders have concluded yet, there is no evidence to suggest the lead time is anything other than the promised 4 periods. Demand for the first 5 periods has been [71, 120, 95, 116, 82] according to historical data provided in the prompt, while the 'game history' section shows slightly different realized demand [110, 145, 113, 88]. Averaging the realized demand from the history ([110+145+113+88]/4 = 114), I will use the default method for now as the sample size is small and we are still waiting for the first delivery to verify the pipeline. I will set L to default (4) and use all available samples for mu and sigma since no clear regime shift is observed yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, which confirms an reaching lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples provided for Periods 1-5 (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) show a mean of 96.8. However, actual realized demand in the game history for Periods 1-5 (110, 145, 113, 88, 35) is quite volatile and reflects stockouts in Periods 1-4 and a sharp drop in Period 5. The total in-transit quantity is 474 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), while the on-hand inventory is 97. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using all available historical demand samples (N=5) provides a balanced estimate of mean demand (~97) and volatility. I will use the 'default' lead time method since the promised lead time is currently accurate, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the observed levels while remaining responsive to the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1891.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by Period 1's order arriving in Period 5 and Period 2's order arriving in Period 6 (both L=4). Demand over the first 6 periods shows a mean of approximately 82.8 units per period (samples: 110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106). Note that historical demand data provided in the prompt (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) differs slightly from the game history logs; I will prioritize the game history for recent behavior. There isn't a strong signal of a regime shift yet, though Period 5 was unusually low. To be safe and capture the recent variability, I'll use all 6 available game history samples (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. With L=4, the coverage required is (1+L)=5 periods. Pipeline inventory is currently 412 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), which aligns with the expected lead time flow.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1166.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing regular chips with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Periods 5, 6, and 7). The current on-hand inventory is 202 units, with 359 units in transit (orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7). Historical demand since arrivals began (Periods 5-7) has been 35, 106, and 72 units. Prior to arrivals (Periods 1-4), demand was recorded as 110, 145, 113, and 88, although these were lost sales. The mean demand across all 7 periods is approximately 95.5 units. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 1 + L = 5 periods of demand. Setting L to the promised (and confirmed) 4. For mu_hat, I will use all 7 samples (N=7) to capture both the initial high demand and recent variations, resulting in a base stock level that targets roughly 95.5 * 5 = 478 units. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, recent_N with N=7 is appropriate. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=7 to capture the observed volatility (Std Dev \u2248 32.5), helping the OR backend set a safety stock via the service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 245 units and 250 units in transit. Historical data from Periods 5-8 confirms the actual lead time L = 4 (orders from P1-P4 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Demand remains relatively stable, with an average of approximately 98 units over the last 8 periods. Given L=4, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). My current pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 495 units. The expected demand over 5 periods is ~490 units. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the parameters provided. Since the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the most relevant demand distribution following the initial stock-out phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1739.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable pattern over the last 9 periods with a mean of approximately 98.2 units and a standard deviation of 30.6. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes detected in the demand data (Period 1-9: 110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106, 72, 112, 101). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. With an on-hand inventory of 180 and 329 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P6, P7, P8, and P9), the system is well-buffered. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture the full observed demand history since the start, and 'default' for lead time as the observed 4-period lead time matches the promised specification. This configuration will allow the OR backend to maintain a base stock level that covers demand during the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), balancing the relatively high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2170.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 129 units, and there are 354 units in transit. Historical demand shows a stable pattern with a mean of approximately 100 units per period (last 10 periods average is 100.3). Lead time has consistently been confirmed as 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments (P1 through P6). Predicted demand for the exposure period (L+1 = 5 periods) is roughly 500 units. Since current on-hand (129) + in-transit (354) = 483 units, the system is nearly balanced with our forecast. I will maintain L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the full history of realized demand while excluding the initial pre-game samples if they significantly differ from the observed game demand. The OR backend will use these to maintain the target base stock level against the in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 5 through Period 11 consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, ..., P7 arrived P11). I am using 'default' for L to align with this confirmed 4-period lead time. Demand analysis shows 11 historical samples (excluding initial seed training data) with a mean of approximately 99 units. Comparing the first half (P1-P5) mean of ~98.2 to the second half (P6-P11) mean of ~96.5, there is no evidence of a regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture all available in-game observations, which provides a more relevant forecast than the seed data alone. This helps the OR backend establish an (L+1) base stock level to cover current demand plus the 4-period lead time pipeline, balancing against the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by historical arrivals from Period 5 through Period 12 (orders from P1-P8 all arrived with L=4). Demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~100 units. Period 12 demand was 107. The total pipeline (on-hand 99 + in-transit 392 = 491) is being compared against a 5-period window (L+1). With an average demand of approximately 97.4 units (calculated from all historical periods), the current base stock requirement is around 487 units. Since current inventory (491) is slightly above the estimated base stock, a small or no order is likely. I will use the 'default' method for L as it matches reality, and 'recent_N' with N=12 for demand to capture all observed patterns since the game start.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment shows a stable lead time of 4 periods, consistently confirmed by arrivals from Period 1 through Period 9. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations. Looking at the full history since Period 1, including the initial samples provided (mean \u2248 96.8) and the game history demand (mean \u2248 95.1). No significant regime shift is detected; the demand remains within a consistent range (min 35, max 145). Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline should cover 1+L = 5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand (84) + In-transit (383) = 467 units. Expected total demand over 5 periods is approximately 100 * 5 = 500 units. Since there is no clear evidence of a shift in mean or volatility, I will use the default methods for all parameters, which utilize all available historical data to calculate the base stock level and capture the general demand distribution.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P10). Demand for the last 10 periods (P5-P14) has averaged approximately 94.1 units per period, while the overall average (P1-P14) is 100 untis. There is no evidence of a major regime shift or seasonality based on the generic period labels. On-hand inventory is 89 units, which is slightly below one period's average demand, but 417 units are in-transit (P11-P14 orders), which aligns with the lead-time requirement of covering roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will set L to 4 (default) and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the more stable post-initial-stocking demand patterns observed since Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1642.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a relatively stable pattern between Periods 5 and 15, following an initial higher-demand phase in Periods 1-4. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P5-P15) is approximately 94.7 units, which is lower than the overall average (approx 98.7) and the early peak. Lead time is consistently confirmed as exactly 4 periods by 11 consecutive arrivals (P5-P15). Current inventory (125 on-hand + 359 in-transit = 484 total) is well-positioned to cover the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Since there is a clear demand stabilization after P4, I am using a recent_N window of 11 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this regime accurately and avoid overweighting the initial stock-out period volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable demand regime Period 5-15: mean ~95, down from initial P1-P4 peak (~114).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~95 since Period 5, following an initial peak. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all 12 observed arrivals (P5-P16 all show lead_time=4). On-hand inventory is 124, and in-transit inventory is 393. The pipeline includes orders from P13 (106 units expected this period), P14 (129), P15 (71), and P16 (87). Based on the recent stable demand regime (P5-P16), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=12 to focus on this segment. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable following the regime shift identified at Period 5. The mean demand from Period 5 to Period 17 is approximately 98 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 23. This is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 16. Lead times have been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods for all 13 completed delivery cycles (P1 through P13). In-transit inventory (328 units) covers the orders from P14 (129), P15 (71), P16 (87), and P17 (41). The next arrival in Period 18 resolution will be the 129 units ordered in Period 14. Given the stability of both demand and lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters to reflect the current regime (N=13, from Period 5 onwards).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand observed in Period 18 was 157, which is a significant outlier compared to the previously established mean of ~95 (Period 5-15). This represents a 65% increase over the mean. Looking at the history, the initial periods (P1-P4) had higher demand (avg ~114), and recent periods P13-P18 show a mean of ~102.6. The Period 18 surge suggests either a new regime or a significant isolated spike. I will use a shorter window (N=6, covering P13-P18) for mu_hat to account for this recent increase in demand and volatility, while maintaining L=4 as the lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods. This helps the OR backend increase the base stock to cover potential higher demand during the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2819.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 18, demand has increased significantly (P18: 157, P19: 150) compared to the stable Period 5-15 mean (~95) and the seed data (avg ~92). The last two periods' average is 153.5. This suggests a new high-demand regime, possibly seasonal or a trend shift. I will set L to 'default' (4) as the actual lead time has been perfectly consistent at 4. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent spike (average of P15-P19 is approx 109, which bridges the gap but may still be conservative; I will monitor for a sustained shift). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher demand numbers. The high In-transit (378) and low On-hand (31) are expected given the lead time and recent sales; the OR backend will calculate the order needed to reach the base stock level across the lead-time pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift detected at Period 18: recent 2-period demand average increased to 153.5 (prev avg ~95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand volatility is significant. After a spike in Periods 18 and 19 (demand 157 and 150), Period 20 recorded an unusually low demand of 20. This suggests the recent 'spike' might have been a temporary fluctuation or the start of highly variable demand rather than a clean step-change to a higher mean. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P16-P20), the average demand is 94.2, which is very close to the established long-term average of ~95. The most recent three periods (P18-P20) average 109. Given that we are entering Period 21 and the lead time is consistently 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the overall volume of the last cycle while acknowledging the increased variance. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the jump in volatility (from 150s down to 20). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 appears highly volatile; Period 20 demand (20) contradicts the previous two-period spike (avg 153.5). Overall 5-period mean remains near 95.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Period 21 saw a massive demand spike of 190, following mixed signals (20 in P20, 150/157 in P18-19). The 5-period average (P17-P21) is 121.4, which is significantly higher than the previous period 5-15 stable regime of ~95. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 554 units includes orders from P18 (88), P19 (162), P20 (181), and P21 (123). The order from P18 (88 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P22) resolution phase, which should alleviate the stock-out. Given the recent volatility and the high demand in P21, I will shift the forecast (mu_hat) to reflect the recent N=5 average to ensure the OR backend increases the base stock level to cover the potential new higher-demand regime while the pipeline inventory trickles in.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely confirmed: Period 17-21 average (121.4) is ~28% higher than Period 5-15 average (~95), though variance has increased significantly.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 18-22) shows a significant increase and high volatility, with values including 157, 150, 20, 190, and 109. The average for this 5-period window is 125.2, significantly higher than the previous stable average of ~95. This shift justifies using a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting. For mu_hat, N=5 captures this new regime while balancing the outlier (20) and the spikes (190). For sigma_hat, N=5 is chosen to reflect the increased variance observed in this same period. The inventory position is currently strained (on-hand is 0), and there is a high stockout risk; however, the order pipeline is substantial (698 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from Periods 14-18. Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (1+L) periods, maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: 5-period average (P18-P22) is 125.2, a ~32% increase over the previous stable mean (~95), accompanied by significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~65).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift detected at Period 18 remains significant but highly volatile. Over the last 6 periods (P18-P23), demand has been {157, 150, 20, 190, 109, 88}, resulting in a mean of 119. Even with the drop in the last two periods, the average is still ~25% higher than the previous stable period (P5-P15 avg ~95). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P19 order arrived on P23). On-hand inventory is 74, and the pipeline is full with 705 units in transit, reflecting aggressive ordering in response to recent stockouts. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture this high-mean/high-variance regime while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the confirmed stable lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to properly account for the heightened volatility observed since Period 18, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for the (L+1) window.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 18) confirms a regime shift to a higher mean and significantly higher volatility compared to the earlier stable period. Specifically, the average demand from Period 18 to 24 is approximately 119.1 units per period, with a standard deviation around 54. This is a substantial increase from the ~95 units mean observed in Period 5-15. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent 'Period N-4' arrivals in the history. To handle the increased volatility and the higher average demand, I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this newer, more volatile regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher units required across the (L+1) period horizon while maintaining a buffer against the observed demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: avg increased from ~95 to ~119 (+25%) with significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~54).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) entered a new regime at Period 18, characterized by a higher mean (~119 compared to the previous ~95) and significantly increased volatility. Although Period 25 recorded an anomalously low demand of 10, the broader pattern from Period 18-25 (average ~105, but excluding the outlier ~119) suggests we should maintain a robust forecast to avoid stockouts, which occurred in Periods 21 and 22. Lead-time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the behavior of the current regime starting at Period 18, balancing the recent volatility and the recent outlier. This allows the backend to account for the increased variance while maintaining a base stock level that reflects the higher average demand of the current period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18, characterized by a higher mean (~105-110) and significantly higher volatility compared to the stable Period 5-15 regime. Recent data (P25 demand=10, P26 demand=55) shows a cooling off from the P18-P23 peak, though variance remains high. On-hand inventory is currently high (425) due to the arrival of a large P22 order (232 units) while demand was low (55). In-transit inventory includes orders from P23 (169), P24 (39), and P25 (101), totaling 309. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory relative to the recent demand average, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic is likely to produce small or zero orders to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 9 for demand and sigma to capture the post-shift behavior while smoothing out the extreme 20/190/10/55 outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1086.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 25-27) has dropped significantly (10, 55, 84) following the highly volatile surge observed between Periods 18-24. The 5-period average (P23-P27) is approximately 71.4, which is lower than the previous regime (~119). However, inventory levels are currently very high (On-hand: 510) due to large orders placed during the high-volatility phase (ordered P22, P23) arriving now. With an 'In-transit' of 140 (ordered P24, P25), the total pipeline is 650 units, which covers nearly 9-10 periods of demand at current rates. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and softening demand, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent cooling of demand and avoid further overstocking, while keeping L at calculate to reinforce the 4-period stability.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled significantly Periods 25-27 (avg ~50) compared to the Period 18-24 volatile peak (avg ~120), leading to an overstock situation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $631.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has cooled significantly in the last four periods (P25-P28), with an average of 52 units, compared to the highly volatile period between P18-P24 (avg ~120). Currently, on-hand inventory is 490 units. With an expected lead time of 4 periods, total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 591 units. This covers over 11 periods of the current average demand (52), creating a significant overstock situation given the profit ($19) to holding cost ($1) ratio. To prevent further accumulation of holding costs, I am signaling the OR backend to set a conservative base stock. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the high-volatility peak (starting P18) to the current cooling phase, while maintaining the L=4 based on consistent historical performance (all captured arrivals had a lead time of 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled significantly between Period 25-28: avg 52 units vs. Period 18-24 avg of ~120 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-131.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly cooled over the last five periods (P25-P29), with an average demand of approximately 46.2 units (10, 55, 84, 59, 23). This follows a highly volatile period (P18-P24). Current on-hand inventory is very high (568 units) due to large orders placed during that high-demand phase arriving while demand was dropping. With a lead time of 4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Even at the previous high-demand average of ~120, 568 units would last nearly 5 periods; at the current average of ~50, it covers over 11 periods. We have 93 units in-transit (reaching a total pipeline of 661). To minimize holding costs and allow inventory to bleed down, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 25: Mean demand dropped to ~46 units (P25-P29) from the previous volatile average of ~120 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 25. Analyzing recent demand (P25-P30): 10, 55, 84, 59, 23, 55. The average demand for these 6 periods is approximately 47.7, which is a significant drop from the previous volatile period (P18-P24 avg ~120). Currently, the inventory position is extremely high: On-Hand is 513 units and In-Transit is 93 units (from Period 29), totaling a pipeline of 606 units. Given the new demand mean of ~48 and a lead time of 4, the required base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is roughly 240-300 units. Since 606 > 300, the inventory is more than double what is needed for the current regime. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower demand mean and volatility, which will cause the OR backend to produce zero orders until the excess inventory is depleted, thereby minimizing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the lower demand profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2247.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Following a high-volatility peak (Period 18-24), demand cooled significantly from Period 25-30 (averaging ~46 units). However, Period 31 showed a sharp spike to 138 units. While this could be a single-period outlier, I need to balance the recent cooling trend against this new potential increase. The current inventory (On-hand: 375) is very high relative to the recent mean, but total pipeline inventory (93 units) is relatively low. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I must ensure coverage for P32-P36. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the end of the low-demand phase and the recent spike: P25-P31 avg ~60.5) provides a conservative but responsive forecast. I will continue to use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period timing has been highly consistent.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand spiked to 138 units after a 6-period low-demand phase (P25-P30 avg ~46), suggesting a possible end to the cooling regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $605.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of cooling (P25-P30 avg ~46) followed by a sharp spike at P31 (138) and a moderate return at P32 (49). The current on-hand inventory is 326 units, which is quite high compared to the recent mean, explaining why no orders have been placed by the OR system in the last few periods. However, with a lead time of 4 periods (L+1=5), we must ensure we cover the pipeline. In-transit inventory only consists of the 93 units ordered in Period 29 (scheduled to arrive in Period 33). This means after Period 33's arrival, the total pipeline plus on-hand will be 326 (current) + 93 (arriving) - P33 demand. Given the high volatility observed between Period 18 and now (ranging from 10 to 190), a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (capturing the cooling phase and the recent spike) is selected to balance the risk of a new high-demand regime against the existing surplus. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 31-32 average (93.5) is significantly higher than the Period 25-30 'cooling' average (~46), but lower than the volatile peak (~120).

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a state of high volatility with no clear stable regime. Over the last three periods (P31-P33), demand has been 138, 49, and 27, yielding a 3-period average of 71.3. This is higher than the previous 'cooling' phase (avg ~46) but lower than the volatile peak (avg ~120). Currently, on-hand inventory is 392 units, which is extremely high (covering over 5 periods of recent average demand). With a lead time (L) confirmed at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=9 (covering the volatile period from P25 onwards) provides an average demand of 56.67 per period, so mu_hat should be approximately 283. Since on-hand inventory (392) plus in-transit (21) already exceeds this coverage at 413 units, the OR backend will correctly suppress new orders. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the shift from the cooling phase and the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory level is currently very high (363 units) relative to recent demand. Demand has returned to a cooler phase after the Period 31 spike: the last three periods (P32-P34) averaged ~35 units. The Period 25-34 average is ~50 units. With on-hand inventory (363) already covering over 7 periods of average demand and the lead time confirmed at 4 periods, we are in an overstock situation. The OR engine's capped policy will naturally restrict ordering, but I will adjust the parameters to reflect this lower-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. mu_hat will use the last 10 periods (P25-P34) as N=10 to capture this lower average (~50) and discourage further significant ordering while the stock depletes to avoid high holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25-34 is significantly lower, averaging 50.4 units, despite a one-period spike in Period 31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2917.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows extreme volatility, oscillating between low periods (~20-50 units) and sharp spikes (P31: 138, P35: 164). Period 35's high demand of 164 significantly reduced the inventory surplus. We are currently in a secondary demand regime following the cooling phase of P25-P30. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) has increased to 81.4 units, up from the average of 46 units during the cooling phase. Given this renewed volatility and higher mean, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the shift from the low regime back to the volatile one) and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat (N=10 to capture both the low periods and the spikes for a robust volatility estimate). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified again starting Period 31: average demand P31-P35 increased to 81.4 units compared to the P25-P30 average of ~46 units (+77%), characterized by extreme single-period spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2021.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 31. The Period 31-36 average demand is approximately 86 units, significantly higher than the previous 'cooling' phase (Period 25-30 avg ~46), but still lower than the earlier Period 18-24 peak. Specifically, recent demands (138, 49, 27, 29, 164, 111) show extreme swings. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory has dropped to 88 units following high demand in P35 and P36. With 198 units in-transit (ordered P33-P36), the pipeline is active. Given the recent increase in both mean and volatility, I am using a recent_N of 6 periods (covering the start of this volatile phase) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current regime's average (~86) and captures the high variance (std ~59), ensuring the base stock level reflects the increased risk of stockouts during spikes while recognizing the actual lead time L=4.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 31: Demand average increased to ~86 units (P31-P36) with high volatility (StdDev ~59) following the Period 25-30 cooling phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has hit zero (on-hand: 0) as of Period 37 conclude, following high demand in Period 35 (164), Period 36 (111), and Period 37 (110). Although arrivals occurred in Period 37, they were insufficient (21 units) to meet demand, leading to lost sales. We are now in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 31. The average demand from Period 31-37 is approximately 89.7 units with significant variance. Lead time holds steady at 4 periods. Since my current position (on-hand + in-transit) must cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), and current in-transit (361) only covers about 4 periods of the current average demand (~360 units), I must ensure the OR backend uses the most recent 7-period window to capture this higher mean and volatility. This will allow the base stock calculation to account for the current demand spike and prevent further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand is in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 31, with a mean of approximately 107.8 units over the last 8 periods (P31-P38: 138, 49, 27, 29, 164, 111, 110, 101). This is a significant increase from the previous 'cooling' phase (avg ~46). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory is 0 and we have substantial in-transit orders (536 units, mostly placed in the last few periods), we need to set parameters that maintain a high service level to recover from the stock-out while accounting for the high demand variance. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this active regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the high volatility (StdDev ~50 in this period). Lead time remains 'default' at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 confirmed as sustained: Period 31-38 average demand is 103.6 units, compared to Period 25-30 average of 46 units. Volatility remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 31, moving from a cooling phase (avg ~46) to a high-volatility, high-demand phase (avg ~104 for P31-P38). The most recent period (P39) had a demand of 120, continuing this trend. Currently, there is an inventory crisis: On-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period due to small orders placed during the cooling phase (Periods 33-35) finally arriving. However, 631 units are in-transit, including large orders from Periods 36, 37, and 38 (160, 184, 180 units respectively) which are expected to arrive in Periods 40, 41, and 42 based on the consistent 4-period lead time. To address the current stockout while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (since Period 31) to capture the higher mean (~104) and sigma_hat using the default method to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extreme volatility (StdDev ~50) seen in this regime. This should result in a high base stock to protect against the ongoing volatility once the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-volatility demand regime P31-P39: mean ~105, significantly higher than P25-P30 (avg ~46). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2220.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 31 to a high-mean, high-volatility state. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is approximately 104.9 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~105. Period 40 demand was 119. On-hand inventory is currently low (41), but in-transit inventory is substantial (471). Specifically, the large orders placed in Periods 37 (184 units), 38 (180 units), and 39 (107 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 41, 42, and 43 respectively, assuming the stable 4-period lead time holds. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this current high-volatility regime (P31-P40). This will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the increased mean (~105) and significant variance observed recently, while the backend's capped policy prevents over-ordering given the large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1795.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 31 to a high-volatility, high-mean state. For the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the average demand is approximately 113.2 units with significant variation (ranging from 27 to 164). This confirms the sustained nature of the 'high' regime noted in previous insights. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 124 units. Total in-transit inventory is 430 units (consisting of orders from P38, P39, and P41). Since lead time is 4, the P38 order (180 units) is expected to arrive during Period 42, followed by P39 (107 units) in Period 43. Given the target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the high-demand regime starting from Period 31 while accounting for the high volatility in the sigma calculation to prevent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime P31-P41: mean ~113.2 units, significantly higher than the P25-P30 cooling phase (avg ~46). Volatility remains high (StdDev ~43).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1936.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 31 to a high-demand, high-volatility state. Over the last 12 periods (P31-P42), the average demand is 105.2 units with a standard deviation of 44.1. This is a significant increase from the previous cooling phase (avg ~46). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 38 order in Period 42. Since the transition at Period 31, demand has stayed consistently elevated despite fluctuations. I will use recent_N=12 to capture this sustained high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The current on-hand inventory (192) and in-transit (344) are being factored into the capped base-stock policy by the OR engine. Setting L to default (promised 4) is appropriate given the consistent observed lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1141.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 31-43) confirms a sustained average of approximately 106.5 units, which is significantly higher than the preceding cooling phase (Period 25-30, avg ~46). Volatility remains notable (StdDev ~38 for this period). Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. With only 7 periods remaining in the simulation, it is crucial to maintain enough inventory to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) without over-ordering as we approach the end-of-horizon. Current on-hand (227) and in-transit (349) total 576 units. Based on the recent mean (~106.5), 5 periods of demand would require approximately 532.5 units. The pipeline inventory is currently sufficient to cover expected demand, though the OR backend's capped policy will adjust the order to account for volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture this high-demand regime since Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime P31-P43: mean ~106.5, significantly higher than P25-P30 (avg ~46). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established in Period 31 remains stable and high-volume. For the Period 31-44 window, the average demand is approximately 107.5 units per period. The inventory position is currently healthy with 122 units on-hand and 407 units in-transit. Although Period 44 saw no arrivals (following a period where no order was placed in Period 40), the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent completed cycles (P37, P38, P39). I will continue using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the entire current regime since Period 31) to capture the sustained higher mean of ~107.5 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=14 to account for the high volatility (StdDev ~38) observed during this phase. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the (L+1) window of ~540-600 units (mu_hat calculation: 5 * 107.5 = 537.5).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime P31-P44: Mean demand is 107.5 units (compared to previous cooling phase of ~46), with continued high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1335.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 31) remains sustained and characterized by high demand (mean ~107.5) and high volatility. Period 45 demand was 80 units, following a sequence of 105, 72, 112, and 101. The 'recent_N' method with N=15 covers this current high-demand regime (P31-P45). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 45 of the order placed in Period 41 (4 periods). On-hand inventory is 185, with 366 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, especially with the game nearing its conclusion at Period 50. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the policy is tuned to the current high-volatility regime rather than including the significantly lower demand \u2018cooling\u2019 phase (P25-P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1321.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 31. The mean demand from Period 31 to Period 46 is approximately 101.4 units. While there was a previous peak around Period 42 with a mean of 113, the most recent 5-period average (P42-P46) has slightly softened to 89.8 units. However, the overall regime remains significantly higher than the cooling phase (Period 25-30). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory management: On-hand (199) and In-transit (342) total 541 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Current pipeline and stock levels are healthy. I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat to capture the entire 'high-demand' regime since Period 31, providing a robust average (~101 units) while accounting for the high volatility (StdDev ~37). This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level given the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1669.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand, high-volatility regime starting from Period 31. The average demand from Period 31 to 47 is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of 33. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P41, P42, and P43 in their expected windows. Currently, we have 212 units on-hand and 301 units in-transit (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). Given we are at Period 48 of 50, only orders placed now (P48) or in P49 would potentially arrive before the game ends at P50 (because lead time is 4, an order placed in P48 arrives in the arrival phase of P52, which is outside the window). However, the OR backend parameters still need to reflect the current regime to manage the inventory position for the remaining demand resolution phases of P48, P49, and P50. I will use the established regime (P31-P47) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since N = 47 - 31 + 1 = 17, I will use N=17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1430.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a stable but volatile high-demand regime since Period 31. Over the last 18 periods (P31-P48), the average demand is 99.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. The most recent 5-period average (P44-P48) is 89.8 units, suggesting a slight cooling but still consistent with the post-Period 31 regime (~100 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 45-48). Current on-hand inventory is 185 units with 339 units in-transit (P45 order 102, P46 order 70, P47 order 71, P48 order 96). Total pipeline is 524 units relative to a target cycle of 5 periods (L+1). Given we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the penultimate ordering period. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the high-demand volatility to ensure service levels, but will naturally cap orders due to the pipeline inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to capture the current high-demand regime (P31-P48) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P31-P48 confirmed stable: mean ~100 units, StdDev ~35. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1733.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 31, with a mean of approximately 100 units and a standard deviation of 35 (confirmed by Period 49 carry-over). The promised and actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 186 units and in-transit inventory at 315 units, the total pipeline is 501 units. To maintain the target service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use the recent demand regime (P31-P49, N=19) to set the parameters. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current stable but volatile market behavior while the OR backend manages the safety stock via the 0.95 quantile.
