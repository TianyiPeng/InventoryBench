In-transit inventory consists of P1 (132), P2 (132), and P3 (147), totaling 411 units. These are expected to arrive sequentially starting next period.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) and concluded periods (110, 145, 113) show an average demand of approximately 107 units per period. The demand is relatively stable without clear seasonal signals yet (Period 4).\n4.

With 411 in transit and no on-hand stock, the OR's 'un-capped' raw order would be (Base Stock - 411). The cap of 145 is being applied to smooth the replenishment.\n5.

Period 20 saw a sharp drop to 20, but this looks like an outlier/volatility within a generally higher regime or potentially a reporting anomaly. Averaging P18-P20 gives 109, but P18-P19 averaged 153. I anticipate demand will revert to the higher level (~140-150 range) rather than the long-term average. 3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: Current On-hand = 70. In-transit = 462. Total Pipeline = 532.

My goal is to maintain a service level for the final periods (P46-P50) while minimizing leftover inventory at the end of Period 50. Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 488 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) at a rate of 107 units/period is 535 units. There is a projected shortfall of approximately 47 units.

Pipeline (In-transit) is 318 units, consisting of orders from P43 (110), P44 (45), P45 (110), and P46 (53). \n3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has stabilized around ~95 units (P41-P46 avg: 91.5, P35-P46 avg: 107). The previous high-demand regime of ~120 units/period (P35-P42) appears to be softening slightly. \n4. Expected Arrivals: P43 order (110 units) arrives in P47. P44 order (45 units) arrives in P48. P45 order (110 units) arrives in P49. P46 order (53 units) arrives in P50. \n5. Strategy: The game ends at P50. Cumulative inventory to cover demand for P47-P50 (4 periods) is current on-hand (143) + in-transit (318) = 461 units. Average demand of ~100 units/period requires ~400 units to finish the game. Ordering significantly more would only increase holding costs at the game's conclusion. The OR recommendation of 78 units would bring total coverage to 539 units, which is likely excessive given the 50-period limit.
