Total expected demand for the remainder of the game (8 periods * ~85 units/period) is approximately 680 units. However, holding costs are $1/unit, significant relative to the $19 profit, and we already have nearly 5 periods of stock on hand (399 / 85 \u2248 4.7). There are no units in transit. Since the lead time is 4 periods, an order placed now (P43) would arrive in Period 47, leaving only Periods 47-50 to sell those new units. Adding inventory now would primarily increase holding costs for several periods with a risk of ending the game with high excess inventory. I will skip ordering this period to continue drawing down the current high on-hand surplus.",

Since Period 36, demand has averaged approximately 87 units per period (P36-P43: 46, 95, 111, 93, 100, 84, 66, 61). Recently, the demand has trended even lower, with the last 3 periods averaging 70 units. Current on-hand inventory is 338 units, and there are 0 units in-transit. Given that we are at Period 44 and the game concludes at Period 50, there are only 7 periods of demand remaining (Periods 44-50). At the current average demand rate of ~80-90 units, the total remaining demand is estimated between 560 and 630 units. However, holding costs are $1.0/unit, while profit is $19.0/unit. Placing an order now would arrive in Period 48 (Lead Time = 4), leaving only 3 periods of sales (48, 49, 50) for that new stock. My current on-hand inventory of 338 units will cover approximately 4 to 5 periods of demand. Given the goal to maximize profit minus holding costs and the proximity to the end of the game, I will place a conservative order to ensure I don't run out during the final periods while avoiding excessive holding costs for units that won't sell before Period 50.",

We currently have 398 units available, leaving a projected deficit of 82 units by the end of Period 50. Since the order placed today is the last one that can arrive before the game ends (reaching on-hand status for Period 50), I will place an order to cover the remaining deficit and provide a small buffer for safety stock, while being mindful of ending inventory holding costs.",

Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, this is the final opportunity to adjust the terminal inventory to cover demand through Period 50. Analysis: (a) Calendar/Product: No specific calendar triggers but demand has stabilized at a lower mean. (b) Demand Regime: Recent demand (P41-P45) follows a pattern of 84, 66, 61, 90, 100 which averages ~80 units/period. (c) Lead Time/Pipeline: Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 148. Scheduled arrivals: P44 order (150 units) arrives in P48; P45 order (100 units) arrives in P49. Total pipeline + on-hand = 398 units. (d) Requirements: We need to cover 5 periods of demand (P46, P47, P48, P49, P50). At an average of 80 units/period, total demand is ~400 units. Current total inventory (on-hand 148 + in-transit 250) is 398. (e) Decision: To ensure we do not stock out in the final periods while minimizing holding costs for a product with $1.0 cost vs $19.0 profit, a small buffer is prudent. Ordering 100 units today provides a total of 498 units for the remaining 5 periods, allowing for a demand up to ~100 units/period without stockouts.",

The current inventory status is 95 units on-hand with 350 units in-transit. Based on the recent stabilized demand regime of ~80 units per period (P41-P46 average is ~75), the 95 units on-hand will likely satisfy demand for Period 47 and part of Period 48. The orders from Periods 44, 45, and 46 (total 350 units) are scheduled to arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50 respectively.

We must rely on on-hand inventory and current in-transit arrivals to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). Current on-hand is 14. We have 350 units in transit: 150 (ordered P44, expected P48 resolution), 100 (ordered P45, expected P49 resolution), and 100 (ordered P46, expected P50 resolution). Even though 'In-transit' shows 350, these units only arrive at the end of their respective periods. Based on the delivery schedule, 150 units should arrive during Period 48 (available for P49 demand), and 100 during Period 49 (available for P50 demand). Demand has stabilized around 80 units/period. The immediate risk is a stockout in Period 48 since we only have 14 on hand and the incoming 150 units arrive *after* P48 demand. However, ordering now does not fix a P48 stockout.

Given that the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed today (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 53 (49 + 4), which is past the game's end at Period 50. Therefore, any new order will only incur costs without generating revenue. However, I have 200 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the order from Period 45 (100 units) is expected to arrive in Period 49 (45 + 4) and the order from Period 46 (100 units) is expected in Period 50 (46 + 4). Even without these arrivals, the 84 units on-hand are nearly sufficient to cover the expected demand of ~80 units for Period 49. With the incoming Period 45 order arriving during this period, I will have more than enough inventory to fulfill all remaining demand for both Period 49 and Period 50.
