To maintain stock for the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (so L+1=5 periods), I need to cover demand for Period 1 through Period 5. Based on historical average (~107), 5 periods of demand equals approximately 535 units. Since there is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I will place an order for 540 units to ensure availability when the shipment arrives in Period 5, accounting for the recent historical demand levels.",

Since game start (P1-P15), demand has averaged 87 units/period. Recent demand (P11-P15) has been [96, 60, 61, 83, 96], averaging 79.2. I will use a forecast of ~90 to provide a safety buffer. (c) Lead Time: Arrivals from orders P1, P2, P3, P4, P9, P10, and P11 all confirm a lead time of exactly 4 periods. (d) Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 186. In-transit consists of shipments from P12 (100 units, due P16), P14 (100 units, due P18), and P15 (50 units, due P19). Order from P13 was 0. The 100 units from P12 will arrive during the current period (P16) resolution phase. Total current inventory + pipeline = 186 + 250 = 436.

However, considering the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), I prefer a slightly leaner inventory. Given the stable demand, ordering 50 units maintains a healthy pipeline for future periods without excessive holding costs.",

  "rationale": "The recent demand regime (starting Period 36) has stabilized at a lower mean. Comparing demand from Period 36 to Period 44, the average is approximately 82 units per period (94, 91, 75, 68, 75, 108, 95, 74, 62). We are currently in Period 45, meaning we have 6 periods remaining in the game (45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50). The current on-hand inventory is 414 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive at the start of Period 50. Total expected demand for the remaining 6 periods (including the current period) is approximately 82 * 6 = 492 units. However, since the game ends at Period 50 and we already have 414 units on-hand with NO in-transit units, our current inventory covers almost all expected demand until the end of the simulation. Crucially, holding costs are $1.0 vs $4.0 profit. Over-ordering creates significant holding cost drag in the final periods. Given the goal is to maximize total reward (Profit * units_sold - HoldingCost * ending_inventory), and we have enough stock to cover roughly 5 of the 6 remaining periods, placing no order is the most profitable path to avoid high ending inventory charges.",

With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 47) would arrive in Period 51, which is after the simulation concludes. Therefore, investment in new inventory is impossible to recoup. Furthermore, current on-hand inventory is 309 units, which, at the current demand rate of ~75 units/period, is sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50) without risk of stockouts.

Therefore, any units ordered now will incur procurement costs but will never arrive to satisfy demand or generate profit. Current on-hand inventory is 241 units. The demand regime shifted at Period 36 to a lower mean of approximately 81 units per period (recent demand: P43=74, P44=62, P45=55, P46=50, P47=68). With 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50) and an average demand of ~70-80 units, our total expected remaining demand is roughly 210-240 units.

Looking at recent demand (P41-P48), the average demand is approximately 74 units/period. Therefore, the 159 units currently in inventory should be more than sufficient to cover the demand for Period 49 and Period 50 without needing further stock.

My inventory management strategy requires covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With an average of ~76 units/period, target inventory is ~380 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 86 units and there are no units in-transit. To reach the target level of 380, I need to order approximately 294 units. Given this is the final period of the game (Period 50), placing an order normally wouldn't result in arrivals before the game ends (since L=4). However, the standard objective is to satisfy demand while managing costs. Ordering 100 units is a conservative move to maintain a pipeline, though in a concluding period, the focus is on the current on-hand stock's ability to meet the final period's demand. Since current inventory (86) comfortably covers the expected demand (~76), I will place a nominal order of 100 to maintain the logic of the system, despite it being the final turn.",
