\u8d70{"rationale": "In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) should arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6 (visible at the start of Period 6). To estimate demand, I look at the historical samples: Periods 1-5 had demands of 84, 55, 79, 85, and 126 (Average 85.8). Since there is a significant lead time (L=4) and we need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (Periods 1-5), I need to account for the demand occurring while the first order is in transit. However, customers in Periods 1-4 will face stockouts because nothing can arrive before Period 5 (L=4). My goal is to establish a pipeline that roughly matches the average demand plus a small buffer for variance. Given the average of ~86 units/period, I will order enough to cover the expected demand for the arrival period and build a baseline inventory. I will order 450 units to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (Periods 5-9) to ensure we have stock once the first shipment arrives, accounting for the fact that we will likely miss all demand for Periods 1-4.", "carry_over_insight": "", "action": {"chips(Regular)": 450}}

Orders placed after this period will not arrive before the game ends. Recent demand has shown a slight uptick (Period 45 demand was 116), though the longer-term average is ~90. Current on-hand inventory is 92 units. Looking at the 'In-transit' pipeline: We expect arrivals from orders placed in P42 (0 units), P43 (120 units), P44 (60 units), and P45 (100 units). Specifically: P43 order (120) arrives in P47, P44 order (60) arrives in P48, P45 order (100) arrives in P49. Total projected supply for P46-P49 is: 92 (on-hand) + 120 + 60 + 100 = 372 units. At an estimated demand of ~100/period, we need ~400 units to cover until P49. With 372 units, we are slightly short. An order of 100 units now will arrive in P50 to cover the final period's demand and ensure no stockout at the very end, while not being so large as to incur excessive holding costs if demand softens.",

Therefore, no orders placed from this point forward will result in arrivals before the game concludes. Current inventory status: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 380. Assessing the in-transit pipeline: Order from P43 (120 units) is expected to arrive in P47; P44 (60 units) in P48; P45 (100 units) in P49; P46 (100 units) in P50. Total future arrivals = 380 units. Historical demand in the current regime (P44-P46) averages ~103 units/period. Over the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50), total expected demand is approximately 412 units (103 * 4). The pipeline of 380 units is slightly below this, but any order placed now is useless. Strategy is to simply wait for in-transit stock to arrive and satisfy remaining demand without incurring unnecessary costs or placing ineffective orders.",

Based on the 4-period lead time: (1) Order from P44 (60 units) should arrive in Period 48; (2) Order from P45 (100 units) should arrive in Period 49; (3) Order from P46 (100 units) should arrive in Period 50. Demand has recently averaged ~100 units (P44-P47 average = 100 units). In Period 48, we start with 29 on-hand and expect 60 to arrive, totaling 89 units available. With demand estimated at ~100, we may see a slight stockout or run near zero. In Period 49, we will receive 100 units (ordered P45). In Period 50, we will receive 100 units (ordered P46). Any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game end.

With only two periods of demand left (P49 and P50) and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's end. Therefore, the decision for this period and the next must focus solely on utilizing existing inventory. Current status: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 200. Based on lead-time analysis (L=4), the order from P45 (100 units) is expected to arrive during P49's arrival resolution phase, and the order from P46 (100 units) is expected to arrive during P50's arrival resolution phase. Average demand has recently been around 90-110 units. The arrival of 100 units in P49 will cover P49 demand, and the 100 units arriving in P50 will cover P50 demand, likely leaving minimal ending inventory.

Because the game ends after this period's demand resolution, any inventory remaining at the end of Period 50 will incur holding costs without the possibility of being sold in future periods. Furthermore, any order placed now (in Period 50) would only arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time), which is beyond the game's horizon. Current status: On-hand inventory is 20 units. There are 100 units in-transit (ordered in Period 46), which are scheduled to arrive during Period 50's arrival resolution (lead time 4). This means the total inventory available to satisfy Period 50 demand will be 120 units (20 on-hand + 100 arriving). Historical demand shows a recent average of approximately 90-100 units. Since 120 units are already available to meet this demand and any further units ordered now would simply result in unnecessary holding costs or arrive too late to be sold, the optimal action is to order 0 units.",
