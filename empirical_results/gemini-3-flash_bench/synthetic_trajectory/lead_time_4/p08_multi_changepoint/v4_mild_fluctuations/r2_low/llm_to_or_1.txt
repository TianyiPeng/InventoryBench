Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no historical data yet for 'chips(Regular)' beyond the provided demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126), I will use those samples to establish a baseline forecast. The mean of these 5 samples is 85.8. Since total demand across the lead time + review period is (1+L) * mean, with L=4, the expected demand (mu_hat) is 5 * 85.8 = 429. The standard deviation of these 5 samples is approximately 25.8, so sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 25.8 \u2248 57.7. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to set this initial baseline based on the provided data, and use 'default' for L to follow the promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 129 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 129 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 87, and we lost those sales due to zero stock. Historical demand samples (including the provided list and Period 1's actual demand) are: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126, and 87. The mean demand is approximately 86. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on the promised lead time (default L=4) and historical mean. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior, as there is no clear evidence of a regime shift yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 253 units in-transit (129 from P1 + 124 from P2). Demand for the first two periods was 87 and 86. Historical samples provided show: P1=84, P2=55, P3=79, P4=85, P5=126. Note that the history provided in the prompt's 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section (up to P5) seems to provide future context relative to the 'CURRENT STATUS' (P3). However, looking at the 'GAME HISTORY' provided in the status, demand was actually 87 (P1) and 86 (P2). Given the inventory is 0 and we have a long lead time, we must maintain a steady pipeline. I will use the default promised lead time and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the available history (N=2 from GAME HISTORY, but since the prompt also provided 5 samples, the backend 'default' will use all available samples). Since demand is remarkably consistent (87, 86) so far in the game history, 'default' is a safe starting point.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4 sequence). Consequently, our 'arrived' count in the conclude messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3 is correctly 0. Since no orders have arrived yet, we cannot infer any deviation from the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 3 periods (87, 86, 62) plus the seed data (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) suggests an average demand of approximately 83 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 374 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3), we need to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). 5 * 83 = 415. The pipeline is currently 374, so the OR backend will calculate a replenishment based on the gap. For parameters, I am using the defaults for L and sigma_hat as there is no evidence yet to change them, and I'll use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the most relevant demand average including the recent slight dip.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 have not yet arrived as of the end of Period 4, which is expected (they should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales since Period 1. The in-transit pipeline (446 units) comprises orders from P1 (129), P2 (124), P3 (121), and P4 (72). Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (including current snapshot) has been [84, 55, 79, 85, 126], with a mean of 85.8 and a standard deviation of 25.6. Period 5 shows a spike to 126, which may indicate a shift or volatility increase. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent spike, and 'default' for sigma_hat and L until more lead-time data arrives.

Daily Profit: $58.00, Daily Holding Cost: $71.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) arrived exactly in Period 5 (concluded), confirming a lead time of 4. Total demand history for 5 periods shows values of 87, 86, 62, 80, and 58. The mean demand is approximately 74.6. Since we have a lead time of 4, the demand window we must cover is (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean (74.6 * 5 = 373), our base stock targets should be around 373 plus a safety buffer. Currently, we have 71 on-hand and 317 in-transit, totaling 388 units of pipeline inventory. This is slightly above the expected 5-period demand mean. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the trend of the first five periods (mean 74.6) and 'calculate' for L. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock. Given that Holding Cost equals Profit ($1.0), the backend service level q = 0.5, which targets the median of demand distribution.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Order P1 arrived P5). Demand mean over first 5 periods is 74.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. History confirms the actual lead time L=4 (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5; Period 2 order arrived in Period 6). On-hand inventory is 109 units, with 193 in transit (orders from P3 and P4). Demand history shows samples of [87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86]. The mean demand is approximately 76.5 units per period. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 periods * 76.5 = 382.5 units target. Currently, Inventory Position (IP) = 109 (on-hand) + 193 (in-transit) = 302 units. We need to order more to reach the base stock. I will use L=4 (explicitly setting to promised/observed lead time), and apply a recent_N strategy (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. The backend will calculate base_stock using these parameters and order the difference (target - IP).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-76.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have confirmed a stable lead time of 4 periods based on arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. The initial demand mean across the first 7 periods is approximately 76.6 units (87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, so I will use all available samples (N=7) for mean and volatility. The current state shows 153 units on-hand and 153 units in-transit (orders from P4 and P7). Given the Lead Time L=4, the base stock targets coverage for L+1=5 periods. The OR engine will subtract the pipeline inventory (153) from the calculated base stock to determine the new order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. Currently, there is sufficient on-hand inventory (148 units) to cover demand until the next scheduled arrival, and 158 units remain in-transit (orders from P7 and P8). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 76.6 units per period over the first 8 periods, with no significant structural shifts detected. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand using the full history (N=8) to maintain a steady stock level. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly from all samples to capture historical volatility and optimize the service level against holding costs.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The promised lead time (L) is 4, and historical delivery data (P5, P6, P7, P8) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. In Period 9, no units arrived because nothing was ordered in Period 5 (at least according to the 'conclude' message logic). Demand has been relatively stable; calculating the mean of all available historical samples (9 periods from game history) gives an average demand of 77.3 units per period. With L=4, the replenishment cycle needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the mean (77.3) over 5 periods results in a mu_hat of approximately 386.6. Since demand shows no clear regime shift yet, 'default' or a higher N for recent samples is appropriate to stabilize the forecast against variance. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the mean demand across all observed full periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10 (demand 95, sold 65). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (P5-P8) confirms this is accurate. Orders from Periods 7, 8, 9, and 10 are currently in transit (totaling 322 units). The order from P7 (81 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11 (visible in P12), and P8 (77 units) in P12. Demand has been relatively stable: mean demand over 10 periods is 79.4. Recent demand (P6-P10) shows 83.6. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and the default lead time. This will ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~400 units). With 322 in transit and 0 on hand, the backend will place an order to reach the target level, minus the cap constraints. Since Profit ($1) = Holding Cost ($1), the service level target is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate via the critical ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean remains stable around 80 units (P1-P10 avg: 79.4). Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand over the last 11 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of 80.5, though the last two periods (P10: 95, P11: 92) show a slight upward trend. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). We currently have 315 units in transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Given L=4, my parameters must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~81, the target pipeline inventory (base stock) should be around 405 units. Since 315 are in transit and 0 are on-hand, the system needs to order to bridge the gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full stable history while acknowledging the recent slight volume increase. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current context shows that the on-hand inventory is very low (6 units). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. Demand has been relatively stable, with a slight upward trend in recent periods (P10: 95, P11: 92, P12: 71). The average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 79 units. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. The total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 325, which comfortably covers 5 periods of average demand (5 * 79 = 395, minus 325 = 70 needed). The current low on-hand stock combined with the next expected arrival (P9 order) should arrive in Period 14 (P9+5). I will use recent_N for both demand and sigma to capture the current stable-but-elevated variance, setting N=10 to balance historical data with recent trends.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system is experiencing stockouts, with ending inventory at 0 in three of the last four periods. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (L=4). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 80 units (Historical mean P1-P13 is 79.5). Because on-hand inventory is depleted and we are relying on staggered arrivals to meet demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture current volatility while keeping L at the promised 4 periods to maintain the (L+1) planning horizon for the OR backend.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is stable, averaging 80.3 units over the last 14 periods. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from periods 1-4 and 7-10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (90) exceeded the arriving units (86) in Period 14. However, there are 317 units in transit (orders from P11 to P14), which is substantial compared to the 1+L (5 periods) cycle demand of ~400 units. The upcoming arrivals should alleviate the stockouts. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand and volatility to capture the most stable recent regime (P5-P14), which reflects the current average demand accurately while maintaining a service level that balances the $1.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost (implied service level of 0.50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 10-15) shows a steady increase, with an average of approximately 92 units per period, compared to the earlier average of 80. Consequently, the inventory has been consistently stock-out for the last several periods (ending on-hand is 0). To address this stock-out situation and adjust to the upward demand trend, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (covering Periods 10-15) to capture the higher mean demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR backend uses a capped policy that factors in profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), resulting in a service level target (q) of 0.5. Given the high stock-out frequency, moving to the higher recent mean will help the OR engine increase the base stock level to better meet this shifted demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 10: average demand increased from ~80 to ~92 units (+15%). Stock-outs occurred in 5 of the last 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an acute inventory shortage. On-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period, and we have experienced stock-outs in 6 of the last 7 periods. Demand has spiked significantly, reaching 138 units in Period 16, well above the previous regime average. Since Period 10, demand has averaged 95.6 units, compared to ~79 units in Periods 1-9. This represents a sustained regime shift (+21%). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by Period 16's arrival (ordered P12, arrived P16). My objective is to aggressively recover inventory levels to meet the new demand regime without incurring excessive holding costs, though currently stock-out costs (profit loss) are the primary concern. I will set L to 'default' (4), use the last 7 periods (since the shift at P10) to calculate mu_hat, and use the same window for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility (standard deviation since P10 is ~20, significantly higher than the initial phase).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility and volume increase confirmed starting Period 10: mean demand risen to ~96 units (+21% vs initial) with peak demand reaching 138. Period 16 demand spike (+43% vs recent mean) suggests higher safety stock is required.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 10, increasing from an average of ~80 to ~97 units. Furthermore, the volatility has spiked (standard deviation of ~19 in the recent window vs ~10 previously), with a peak demand of 138 units in Period 16. The current status shows 0 units on-hand and frequent stock-outs over the last 8 periods, indicating that previous order targets were insufficient. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current regime (Periods 10-17). This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods of higher demand) while accounting for the increased risk of stock-outs (higher sigma). The pipeline inventory of 418 units is high, but given the stock-outs, it is necessary to maintain a robust base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P10-P17): Mean demand increased to 96.0 units (+20% vs P1-P9) with significantly higher variance (Std Dev ~19 vs ~10), necessitating higher safety stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (since Period 10) indicates a sustained regime shift with higher volume and increased volatility. Average demand from Period 10 to 18 is approximately 99.7 units, compared to the initial ~80 units. In the last three periods, demand has been even higher (avg 122), primarily driven by peaks of 138 and 129. We are frequently stocking out (ending on-hand inventory is 0 for 8 out of the last 9 periods), which indicates our previous order targets were insufficient for this new regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover service levels and cover demand for the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the higher mean of this second regime. I will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat set to a higher value (90) to ensure the OR backend generates a larger safety stock, acknowledging the high demand spikes (peak 138) and the high cost of stocking out (100% loss of potential profit).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P10-P18): Mean demand ~100 units with high volatility (peaks >130). Frequent stock-outs suggest pipeline inventory is insufficient for current demand variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 10, increasing from ~80 to ~100 units. Over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), the average demand is 101.3 units with a significant standard deviation. The system is currently experiencing frequent stock-outs (ending on-hand=0 in 8 of the last 10 periods) because the base stock calculation has been trailing the actual demand and volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Lead Time L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to increase the base stock level and restore a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime P10-P19: Mean demand 101.3 units (+27% vs initial baseline), requiring higher base stock levels to prevent chronic stock-outs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 10. Since Period 10, the average demand is approximately 103.5 units (calculated from P10-P20: 95, 92, 71, 86, 90, 97, 138, 99, 129, 106, 126), compared to the earlier baseline of ~80. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently strained, with on-hand inventory at 0 and frequent stock-outs (sold < demand in 9 of the last 11 periods). To address this, I will use recent_N with N=11 (P10-P20) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher volume. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation of the recent regime is ~19, notably higher than the start). This will allow the backend to set a base stock that better reflects current demand levels and risks.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P10-P20) average demand: 103.5 units (+30% vs initial). Volatility increased with standard deviation ~19. Frequent stock-outs (9/11 recent periods) confirm inventory target levels were previously too low.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 10. For Periods 1-9, the average demand was 77.1 units. Since Period 10 (Periods 10-21), the average demand has risen to 104.1 units with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 20). Frequent stock-outs have occurred during this period because the inventory targets were based on the earlier, lower-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised = actual). To stabilize service levels and stop the chronic stock-outs, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 periods (P10-P21) to capture this higher-demand regime. This corresponds to N=12. Specifically, for mu_hat, N=12 calculates (~104.1 * 5), and sigma_hat uses N=12 to properly reflect the increased variance since Period 10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 10, increasing from ~80 to ~100 units. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P10-P22), the mean demand is 100.6 with a standard deviation of 22.8. Frequent stock-outs (ending inventory of 0 in 10 of the last 13 periods) demonstrate that inventory levels have been insufficient to cover this volatility. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is high (450 units), covering approximately 4.5 periods of demand at the current rate. I will use a N=13 window (the length of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean and variance while maintaining the promised Lead Time of 4. This will set a base stock level that targets a 50% service level (as profit equals holding cost) while accounting for the recent increase in demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime P10-P22 confirmed: mean demand 100.6 units (+26% vs starting baseline). Volatility has increased significantly (\u03c3 \u2248 23). Frequent stock-outs suggest a need for higher base stock levels despite recent arrivals.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 10. The initial mean demand was approximately 79.4 units (P1-P9), but since Period 10, demand has averaged approximately 100.7 units (P10-P23) with increased volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 23). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 23 of the order placed in Period 19. Despite recent arrivals, the frequent stock-outs observed in the history (11 out of the last 14 periods) indicate that previous inventory targets were insufficient to cover the demand during lead time plus one period (L+1=5). I will use a recent window of N=14 (P10 to P23) to capture the current high-demand mean and standard deviation, ensuring the base stock level (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) accounts for this shift. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, but providing accurate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the higher-demand regime is critical to ensuring the order quantity reflects current needs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 10 and has remained consistently high. From Period 10 to Period 24, the average demand is approximately 102.3 units per period. The recent demand (Period 24) spiked again to 136, resulting in a stock-out (ending on-hand: 0). My previous analysis from Period 23 confirmed a mean of ~101 and a significantly higher standard deviation (approx 23). The current pipeline (in-transit: 386) is roughly equivalent to 3.7 periods of demand at the new mean, which is slightly below the required inventory to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current decision period (Total 5 periods). Therefore, I will continue using the high-demand regime (last 15 periods, P10-P24) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime P10-P24: Mean demand 102.3 units (+29% vs initial baseline). Volatility remains high with frequent stock-outs when demand exceeds 120 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While the baseline (P1-P9) was ~80 units, the period since P10 has seen a sustained increase. Over the last 16 periods (P10-P25), the mean demand is 105.1 units. More critically, the most recent 10 periods (P16-P25) have an average demand of 118.0 units, with several peaks exceeding 130 and a record high of 166 in Period 25. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite recent arrivals, indicating the system is failing to meet this higher demand volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent chronic stock-outs, I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 10-period regime to capture the accelerated growth (118.0 units/period) and increasing sigma_hat to reflect the high variance observed (stdev recently ~29). The backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1) periods, which is essential given the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Mean demand over P16-P25 is 118.0 units (+48% vs initial baseline), with Period 25 hitting a new peak of 166. Volatility has increased significantly (\u03c3 \u2248 29 for the last 10 periods).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While the baseline (P1-P9) was ~80, the mean over P16-P25 increased to 118, and P25 reached a peak of 166. Although Period 26 demand settled back to 91, the trend indicates high volatility and frequent stock-outs. Consequently, I am setting mu_hat using the last 11 samples (Period 16 to 26) to capture this higher mean (~115.5 per period). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, mu_hat should cover 5 periods of demand (approx 577). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=11 to reflect the increased standard deviation (approx 29, so sqrt(5)*29 approx 65). This adjustment ensures the base stock reflects current high-demand reality and prevents the chronic stock-outs observed when targets were based on the old mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Mean demand over P16-P26 is 115.5 units (+45% vs initial baseline), with high volatility (P25 demand reached 166). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The initial baseline (P1-P9) was ~80 units. From P10-P25, demand increased significantly, and specifically over the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand rose to approximately 115 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~29). The most recent period (P27) saw demand of 105, continuing the trend of exceeding on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set parameters that reflect this higher mean and variance to prevent the frequent stock-outs observed recently. Using recent_N with N=10 captures this higher demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. With profit=1 and holding_cost=1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate based on these updated distribution parameters. Pipeline inventory is currently 502 units, but with a 5-period risk window (L+1), and an average demand of ~115, the required base stock is around 575+ units plus safety stock, so continued ordering is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P16-P27): Mean demand ~115 units (+44% vs initial) with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 29). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts. Most recently (P16-P28), demand has averaged approximately 115.5 units with a standard deviation of 29.3, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~80. Period 25 saw a peak of 166. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 26, with 467 units in transit (Pipeline). To address the recent volatility and higher mean, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the accelerated shift at P16) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher sustained demand and variance. This will help maintain a higher base stock level to prevent more stock-outs, as the q-ratio (Profit/(Profit+Holding)) for this item is 0.5, implying the backend targets a service level around the median; given the volatility, explicit tracking of the recent variance is necessary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a higher-regime phase approximately since Period 16, with the mean demand over the last 14 periods (P16-P29) being approximately 116 units. The most recent demand (P29) was 142 units, confirming sustained high volatility and volume. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. My strategy is to set L to 4 for a 5-period horizon (L+1). I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this higher mean and the significant volatility (standard deviation ~29). This provides a base_stock target of (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std, which translates to 5 * 115.5 + 0.67 * sqrt(5) * 29 \u2248 621. Given the current on-hand (13) and in-transit (404), total inventory position is 417, which is below the target. Using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will adjust orders to better match this current demand regime and reduce the frequent stock-outs observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime P16-P29: Mean demand 115.8 units (+45% vs initial), standard deviation ~28. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period_16. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 116 units with a standard deviation of about 26. The most recent demand (P29: 142, P30: 132) reinforces this high-demand state. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P22-P26. I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility, which will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to prevent the frequent stock-outs observed in earlier periods while accounting for the current demand variance. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, with a sustained increase in volume and volatility. For the last 15 periods (P17-P31), the mean demand is approximately 115 units with a standard deviation of 28. Recent demand remains consistently high (P31 demand was 136). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 15 units on-hand and high in-transit levels (mostly from recent large orders), current inventory is tight. To maintain service levels and prevent stock-outs during this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I will use recent_N=15 to capture the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for the lead time which is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime that accelerated around Period 25. For the last 8 periods (P25-P32), the mean demand has risen to approximately 120.5 units with a standard deviation of about 24.5. The most recent period (P32) resulted in a stock-out (on-hand 0) because the arrival of 68 units (from P28) was insufficient to meet the demand of 115. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and frequent stock-outs, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this intensified demand regime and ensure the base stock is calculated against the most relevant volatility. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the 120+ unit average and the risk of spikes reaching 140-160, minimizing the risk of continued stock-outs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime acceleration confirmed (P25-P32): Mean demand increased to 120.5 units (+50% vs initial) with standard deviation ~24.5. Frequent stock-outs continue when arrivals fall below 100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted significantly from its initial baseline of ~80. Over the last 9 periods (P25-P33), mean demand has risen to approximately 124.7 units with a standard deviation of 25.4. Recent periods show high volatility, with demand reaching 158 and 142. Stock-outs have occurred in 3 of the last 4 periods (P32, P33, and P27) because arriving shipments (based on older demand levels) were insufficient to cover the increased demand volume. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent chronic stock-outs and capture higher profit during this high-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (since the Period 25 jump) to better reflect current volatility and mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime P25-P33 confirmed: mean demand increased to 124.7 units (+56% vs initial baseline), with standard deviation ~25.4. Frequent stock-outs occur when arrivals are below 110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, currently stabilizing in a high-demand state. For the most recent 10-period window (P25-P34), the mean demand is 119.9 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 29.8. This reflects the 'regime acceleration' noted in Carry-over Insights but with high volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With profit equal to holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50% (q=0.5), which puts the base stock exactly at the mean demand over the (L+1) horizon. However, to mitigate the frequent stock-outs observed when demand spikes (e.g., P25=166, P33=158), I am using a recent_N window of 10 periods for mu_hat to capture this high-demand era while relying on the default sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility across the recent samples. Current on-hand is 66, and in-transit is 479 (totaling 545), which is slightly below the (5 periods * ~120 units = 600) required to cover the lead time horizon plus current demand.

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime (P25-P34): Mean demand is 119.9 units (+45% vs initial baseline), with significantly higher volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 30). This regime has persisted for 10 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 25. Over the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the mean demand is approximately 119 units with a standard deviation of 26.5. This represents a substantial increase from the initial baseline (~80 units). The lead time remains consistent and stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. With 100 units on-hand and 389 units in-transit (covering orders from P32, P33, P34, and P35), we are currently in a better inventory position than previously, but must maintain the high base stock level to prevent stock-outs during demand peaks (which have recently exceeded 150 units). I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this established high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-121.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 25. Analyzing the last 12 completed periods (P25-P36), the mean demand is approximately 117.7 units with a standard deviation of 31.5. Recent demand in Period 36 was notably low (57 units), which has resulted in a healthy on-hand inventory of 178 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend logic will target a service level (q) of 0.5 (the median). To ensure we don't over-react to the single low demand point in P36 while still accounting for the significantly higher volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 31) seen in this regime, I will use a recent_N window of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the full extent of the current high-demand, high-variance regime. L is set to calculate as lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P25-P36) confirmed: Mean demand ~118 units, but with significantly increased volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 31.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 25. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P25-P37), the mean demand is approximately 115 units with a standard deviation of 31. This regime is significantly higher than the initial baseline (approx 80 units). The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Currently, the On-hand inventory is 169 units, and In-transit is 282 units. Given the lead time (L=4), we are covering a window of 5 periods (L+1). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 to capture the statistics of this current high-demand regime, which ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased mean (around 575 for mu_hat) and the heightened volatility to maintain service levels in the face of frequent spikes (demand recently peaked at 166).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-68.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-volume, high-volatility regime that established around Period 25. For the most recent 14 periods (P25-P38), the mean demand is approximately 115.4 units with a standard deviation of 30.5. Although the last few periods (P36-P38) showed slightly lower demand (57, 120, 94), the overall regime remains much higher than the initial baseline. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 162 units, and in-transit inventory (318 units) covers roughly 2.7 periods of average demand. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the observed stability of that lead time throughout history, I will use L=4. To capture the current regime while accounting for recent fluctuations, I will use the last 14 samples (N=14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This provides a robust base stock level to satisfy high service levels (profit=holding_cost implies a 50% critical ratio, but the OR backend's default z-calculation for Profit=1, Holding=1 results in a q=0.5, z=0; however, the cap and policy ensure we maintain enough pipeline to cover lead time).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 115-120 units since the regime shift around Period 25. Over the last 15 periods (P25-P39), the average demand is approximately 114.7 units, although the last 4 periods have shown a slight decrease (94, 94, 120, 57). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 124 and in-transit at 348 (incorporating orders from P36-P39), the total pipeline is 472 units. The OR backend will use recent data to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set N=15 for both to capture the sustained high-demand regime while allowing for recent volatility adjustments. This covers 5 periods of lead time (L+1) with a target stock level based on a roughly 115-unit/period average, which is consistent with maintaining a high service level given the $1 profit and $1 holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Established high-demand regime (P25-P39): Mean demand is 114.7 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 25. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P26-P40), the mean demand is approximately 107.5 units with a standard deviation of roughly 31.4. While recent demand (P34-P40) has trended slightly lower (average ~90), the preceding periods (P29-P33) saw several spikes above 130, including a peak of 158. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 147 units, and pipeline inventory is 328 units. To ensure high service levels while respecting the increased volatility seen in the overall high-demand regime, I am using a recent window of 15 periods (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the very recent lower demand against the high volatility and potential for spikes observed throughout this regime. Given profit=1 and holding=1, the target service level is 50%, but the OR backend's safety stock calculation helps mitigate the high variance (\u03c3 \u2248 31).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 25. Over the last 15 periods (P27-P41), the mean demand is approximately 106.5 units, which is lower than the peak period (P25-P34) but higher than the initial baseline. The most recent 5-period average (P37-P41) is 96.2 units, indicating a slight softening or return to the mid-regime mean. However, because stock-outs have been frequent in the past, I will prioritize a slightly longer lookback to capture the volatility. I am choosing N=15 for mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately (P27-P41 mean \u2248 106.5). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=15 to reflect the sustained volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 27.5). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand (90) plus in-transit (355) is 445 units, providing a buffer against the 5-period requirement (L+1).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand regime since approximately Period 25. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the mean demand is 96.2 units with a standard deviation of 27.8. While demand was higher in the P25-P34 window (avg ~120), the most recent 10-period window reflects a slight cooling or stabilization around 96-100 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P38 order arrived P42). On-hand inventory is healthy at 136, with 319 units in transit. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this stabilized high-volume performance while adapting to the recent volatility (\u03c3\u224828). This allows the OR backend to target a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of this current regime's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-72.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime over the most recent periods compared to the high-demand peaks observed between P25-P33. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P34-P43), the mean demand is approximately 88.1 units, a significant decrease from the ~115-120 units previously observed. The volatility (standard deviation) over this recent 10-period window is ~18.5. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 147 and 260 units in-transit (total pipeline of 407), and current demand trends significantly lower than earlier in the game, the inventory position is strong. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward shift in demand volume and volatility, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on outdated high-demand history while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the ~88 unit mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 34: Mean demand decreased to ~88 units (P34-P43) from a previous high-demand regime of ~115+ units. Volatility has also reduced to \u03c3 \u2248 18.5.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime that began around Period 34. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P34-P44), the mean demand is 84.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. This is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (~120 units). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory (144) plus in-transit stock (206) totals 350 units. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. With a mean of ~85, the expected demand over the lead time is ~425 units. We are currently carrying a significant pipeline, but on-hand inventory is healthy. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this current stable regime accurately, and use the default lead time which is confirmed at 4.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 34. For the most recent 12 periods (P34-P45), the mean demand is approximately 89.0 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. This is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (~120 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 45 (ordered P41, lead time 4). On-hand inventory is 86, and in-transit is 240, totaling 326. Using recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to capture this lower demand mean and reduced volatility, preventing excessive over-ordering while maintaining adequate service levels for a product where profit and holding costs are equal (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~89 units (P34-P45) compared to the previous ~120 units; volatility reduced to \u03c3 \u2248 17.5.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 34. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P34-P46), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 89.1 units, down from the previous high-demand regime of ~120 units. Volatility has also decreased, with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' (which reflects the stable 4-period history) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=13) to align with this current lower-demand regime. This provides a target base stock that reflects the reduced demand while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the current volatility, avoiding excessive holding costs on-hand (currently 71) and in-transit (274).

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 34. Analyzing demand from P34 to P47, the mean demand is approximately 91.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 17.5. This is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (~120 units). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 43 order exactly 4 periods later in Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (7 units) due to a small arrival in Period 47 (only 27 units), but the in-transit pipeline is substantial (360 units). Given that the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time is 4 periods, orders placed now (Period 48) will not arrive before the game concludes. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current cycle. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the regime from P34 to P47) to reflect the current stable demand mean and lower volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stock-out in Period 48. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P44 order arrived in P48). Demand analysis shows a sustained regime shift starting around Period 34; the average demand for Period 34 to Period 48 is approximately 91.6 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~115+ units. Volatility has also moderated, with a standard deviation of approximately 18.7 units over this 15-period windows. To stabilize inventory while maintaining service levels against this recent demand pattern, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current lower-demand regime while weighting against recent stock-outs. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate as the lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime compared to the mid-game peak. Since Period 34, the mean demand has hovered around 89-92 units. The last 10 periods (P40-P49) show a mean of approximately 92.4 units with a standard deviation of about 16.5. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 12 units, and in-transit inventory is 377 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current lower-demand regime while providing enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed recently. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (aiming for a 50% service level ideally, but the OR logic uses q = p/(p+h)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability P34-P49 confirmed: Mean demand ~92 units (last 10 periods avg: 92.4) with reduced volatility (sigma ~16.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
