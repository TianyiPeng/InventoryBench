Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows an average of 85.8 units (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). There is a visible upward trend in Period 5, but we only have one data point for that potential shift. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the inventory position must cover (L+1) periods of demand to maintain service levels, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand characteristics. This will set a base stock level to cover roughly 5 periods of demand (5 * 85.8 = 429 units), adjusted for volatility and the profit/holding cost ratio (equally balanced at $1/$1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 128 units which are now in-transit. Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this initial order to arrive until the start of Period 6 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message). Historical demand for Period 1 was 98 units, which resulted in lost sales since starting inventory was 0. The 5 pre-game demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' were 84, 55, 79, 85, and 126 (mean = 85.8). Adding Period 1 demand (98) gives a 6-sample mean of 87.8. Since there is no significant evidence of a regime shift yet and actual lead time cannot be inferred until arrivals occur, I will use 'default' methods for Lead Time (L=4) and Sigma. For the mean (mu_hat), I will use 'default' which calculates (1+L) * mean of all available samples (87.8 * 5 = 439). This ensures the OR backend attempts to reach a base stock level covering the lead time plus the decision period.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (128 units) and Period 2 (127 units) are in-transit (Total = 255). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts because demand (98 in P1, 62 in P2) cannot be met yet. Demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided in prompt: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126) shows an upward trend in the most recent sample. I will use recent_N for demand forecasting to capture this recent increase while acknowledging the high volatility. L remains at the promised default of 4 as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit, as expected given the lead time (P1's order is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 START observation). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, which is unavoidable during the initial lead time window. The average demand across the first three periods is approximately 76 units (98, 62, 68). Including the provided historical samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126), the broader demand context shows a mean of roughly 83. Since we have no completed lead-time arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent demand intensity (including the uptick to 85 and 126 in the provided samples) while accounting for the current lead time buffer. This ensures the base stock calculation covers the 4-period lead time plus the decision period (L+1=5).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the first order (placed in Period 1) should arrive during Period 1+4=5 and its arrival will be confirmed in the Period 5 conclude message (readable at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-4 are expected. Historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a significant spike in Period 5 (126), while the previous 4 periods averaged ~75.75. Given this recent jump, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the upward trend and account for potential seasonality or a new demand level, while keeping sigma_hat at default to capture general volatility. I am keeping L at default (4) as no orders are overdue yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. Period 1's order arrived exactly on schedule in Period 5 (lead_time = 4). Orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 311 units) are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Historical demand for periods 1-5 is [84, 55, 79, 85, 126] (average 85.8). Note that the 'sold' units in early periods were 0 due to 0 starting inventory; I must use the historical demand samples provided in the prompt (98, 62, 68, 96, 84 from game history vs the 84, 55, 79, 85, 126 provided in the explicit data list). Reconciling the data: the explicit list provided [84, 55, 79, 85, 126] is used for the forecast. The average is 85.8. Since L=4, the pipeline (inventory + in-transit) should cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand. Current pipeline is 44 + 311 = 355. Target inventory (base stock) is roughly 5 * 85.8 = 429. The OR engine will order the difference. There is a slight upward trend in Period 5 (126 units), so I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to be more responsive to recent demand while maintaining the default lead time estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-59.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history confirms actual lead times of 4 periods for orders placed in P1 and P2 (arriving in P5 and P6 respectively). Current demand across all 6 periods (including provided pre-history samples) shows a stable pattern without significant regime shifts. Mean demand is approx 77 units (samples: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126, 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56). On-hand inventory is 115, with 243 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P6). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 62, 68, 96, 84, 56) averages 73.2. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend's service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) will naturally aim for the median. I will use recent_N for both mean and sigma to capture current variance while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-75.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) and concluded demand (P5-P7) show a consistent pattern around a mean of ~80 units (P1: 84, P2: 55, P3: 79, P4: 85, P5: 126, P6: 56, P7: 85). The average demand across these 7 samples is 81.4. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Pipeline inventory is 121 (orders from P4, P6, P7) and on-hand is 160. Total inventory position is 281. Using the base stock formula with L=4, demand covers 1+L=5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~407 units. Currently, we are under-stocked relative to a service level where profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1) (q=0.5, z=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand to capture the full recent history after the initial startup and 'default' for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P1-P4 arrivals) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the lead time is stable, L is set to 'default'. The demand history shows samples: 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115. There is no clear shift in the demand regime yet; however, the recent demand in P8 (115) is higher than previous periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level. This N size covers P4-P8, providing a balance between stability and responsiveness to the current mean. The inventory position is currently 99 on-hand plus 173 in-transit, which covers expected demand for approximately 3 periods; the OR backend will calculate the necessary replenishment for a (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (P1-P4 all arrived in 4 periods). No order was placed in P5, so the 'arrived=0' in P9 conclude is expected. Current demand across the last 9 periods averages ~83.5 units. The most recent demand (P8-P9) shows slightly higher activity (115, 88), but no sustained regime shift is evident yet. On-hand inventory is low (11), but there are 296 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target will be the median demand over (L+1) periods. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the stable demand mean and variance observed since the simulation started, ensuring we cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 5-10) shows 84, 56, 85, 115, 88, 39, compared to earlier periods. Period 10 shows a significant drop (39), but overall demand remains volatile within the 40-120 range. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6). Note that no order was placed in P5, which explains why P9 concluded with arrived=0. On-hand inventory is low (31), and we have 348 units in transit. Since L=4, my parameters must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (Periods 5-10) rather than the earlier data points. L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead times are stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand after Period 11 demand exceeded supply. The in-transit pipeline of 351 units consists of orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11). Notably, the order from Period 5 was 0 units, which correctly matches the 'arrived=0' message in Period 9 conclude. The order from Period 8 (106 units) is expected to arrive during Period 12 and be visible at the start of Period 13. Demand history (Samples: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126, 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115, 88, 39, 76) shows a mean of ~77.5. Recent demand has been more volatile, particularly with a spike to 115 followed by a dip to 39 and a rise to 76. For Period 12, I will continue using the promised lead time of 4 (Total period coverage L+1=5) and set mu_hat using the last 8 periods to capture recent demand behavior (approx mean 78.8), balancing the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost (1:1 ratio with profit).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 29, and there are 294 units in transit. Historical demand is relatively stable, but we recently experienced a stockout in Period 11 due to low arrivals. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as evidenced by arrivals in P5 (from P1), P6 (from P2), P7 (from P3), P8 (from P4), P10 (from P6), P11 (from P7), and P12 (from P8). Note that P5 was a zero-order period, and P9 arrival was 0 units because the P5 order was 0, matching the lead time. Demand samples {84, 55, 79, 85, 126, 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115, 88, 39, 76, 77} show a mean around 80. With Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting a target z-score of 0. I will use the default lead time (4) and use the most recent 7 samples (P6-P12) to capture the current demand volatility and mean closer to the present state for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a relatively stable mean. Over the last 13 periods, the average demand is approximately 80 units per period (sum of P1-P13 = 1038 / 13 = 79.8). The most recent demand at Period 13 was 94 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods and the game history consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. In-transit inventory is currently 231 (comprising orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13), and on-hand is 58. Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will use a window of recent demand to capture the current mean and volatility. I'll use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a robust yet responsive estimate. Setting L to 'calculate' lets the backend use the confirmed historical lead time average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as evidenced by arrivals from Period 1 to Period 10 (excluding Period 5 which had no order). Current on-hand inventory is 74, with 236 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14). Demand has remained relatively stable without significant shifts. The mean demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 81 units per period. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.50 (z=0), meaning the base stock should target the mean demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1). I will use the last 10 periods for mu_hat to capture recent demand stability and 10 periods for sigma_hat to account for volatility. L=4 remains the most accurate estimate based on history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in all successful arrivals (Periods 5-8, 10-15). Demand remains relatively stable with periodic fluctuations, but no clear structural regime shift is evident in the recent samples. The average demand across all periods (including pre-game samples) is approximately 82 units. With L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5 periods. On-hand inventory is low (30 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (320 units). Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, meaning base_stock will target the median demand. I will use the last 10 samples to capture the most recent demand volatility without overreacting to short-term noise, ensuring the pipeline inventory is accounted for by the OR engine.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 17. Looking at the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the carry-over insight and recent arrivals in P15 and P16). Demand has shown a recent spike, reaching 133 in P16, though historical demand averages around 84. In P11 and P16, we experienced stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that our base stock level has been slightly too lean for recent demand volatility. With on-hand inventory currently at 0 and 311 units in-transit (P13: 60, P14: 116, P15: 95, P16: 40), we need to ensure the pipeline covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent increase in demand (N=10 to balance the recent spike with the longer-term average) while keeping the lead time method at calculate since it has been stable at 4.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a stockout occurring in Period 17 (sold 60 units against a demand of 95). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival history (P1-P13 orders all arrived with L=4). However, the shipment from Period 5 (ordered 0 units) resulted in no arrival in Period 9, causing the inventory dip that eventually led to current stockouts. The demand has shown a slight upward trend recently (Period 16: 133, Period 17: 95). To recover from the stockout and cover the 4-period lead time plus the decision period (L+1=5), I will use the recent 7 periods of demand (excluding the current stockout phase's suppressed sales but including actual demand values) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average demand (~80-90) and the volatility observed in Period 16.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the history (P1-P14 orders all arrived exactly at L=4). Current inventory is low (on-hand 21), and there have been recent stockouts (P16, P17) due to high demand spikes (e.g., 133 in P16). Demand has shown a slight upward trend or increased volatility in the recent period (P5-P18 mean is approx 84, but range is 39-133). Using a recent window of N=10 periods captures the more recent demand environment which includes these higher peaks, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for this volatility. Method 'calculate' for L will maintain the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout occurring in Period 19 (demand 166 vs 116 units sold). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1-P15). Demand has shown a recent upward shift: the average over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 108.8 units, compared to the long-term average of around 88 units. Period 19 specifically saw a spike to 166. Under the base stock policy, the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 to estimate demand over L+1 periods. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the recent volatility and higher mean demand while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting around Period 16: average demand increased from ~80 to ~109 units per period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted upwards starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 20 (recent 5 periods), the values are 133, 95, 95, 166, and 115. The mean for these 5 periods is 120.8, which is significantly higher than the earlier average. Given the promised lead time (L=4) is consistent with observations, the required stock should cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will provide the most responsive parameters to this new, higher-demand regime. The stockout in Period 20 (on-hand 0) confirms that the previous parameters were insufficient for this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting around Period 16. In the last 6 periods (16-21), demand values were [133, 95, 95, 166, 115, 109], averaging 122 units per period compared to the previous average of ~80. I will use N=6 to capture this higher mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (Periods 5-21), so I will use the default method which aligns with the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is low (9 units) with significant backlogs/lost sales in recent periods (P16, P17, P19, P20), so using recent demand data is critical to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to meet the new demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: average demand from Period 16 to 21 is ~122 units (+50% from original baseline).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand volatility and stockouts. Period 22 concluded with zero ending inventory, and we have zero on-hand starting Period 23. Average demand from Period 16 to 22 is approximately 118.57 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the order from Period 18 in Period 22. To ensure we cover demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), we set mu_hat using the last 7 samples (Period 16-22) to capture the recent regime shift mentioned in carry-over insights. Given the recent stockouts and high demand variance (95-166 units), sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 7 samples to ensure the backend computes a sufficient base stock to meet the 50% service level target (critical when profit equals holding cost).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 24. We have zero on-hand inventory and 507 units in-transit. A demand regime shift was previously identified starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 23 (8 periods): [133, 95, 95, 166, 115, 109, 97, 86], the average is approximately 112 units per period, which is significantly higher than the early baseline (~80). However, most recent demand (P21-23) has softened slightly (109, 97, 86). I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this new regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the volatility has also increased with the mean. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in history and carry-over insights), so I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the consistent 4-period history. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). Given we are currently stock-out with zero inventory, ordering to maintain this higher base stock is necessary to meet the elevated demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $159.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained upward shift starting around Period 16. The average demand in this new regime (Period 16\u201324) is approximately 131.6 units per period, compared to the original baseline of ~80. The most recent demand (Period 24) was 169, confirming high volatility and a higher mean. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods (order from P20 arrived in P24). With the profit and holding cost both being $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is low (10) and pipeline is 381. I will use the recent_N method with N=9 to capture the mean of the current higher-demand regime (starting Period 16) and calculate sigma based on the same window to reflect\u8fd1\u671f volatility. This will help the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for the ~130 unit average across the 5-period risk horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Period 16-24 average is ~132 units (+65% from original baseline).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (N=10), the mean demand is approximately 115 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 25) was 167 units, suggesting the higher end of the range is prevalent. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, which corresponds to a z-score of 0. On-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 394 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated demand regime while maintaining sensitivity to recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift firmly established: Period 16-25 average demand is ~115 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline (~82). Recent periods (P24-P25) show spikes over 160 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted upwards, starting around Period 16. Period 26 saw another high demand of 168 following spikes of 169 and 167 in Period 24 and 25. The current average demand from Period 16 to 26 (the last 11 periods) is approximately 123 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~82. Recent demand (P24-P26) is even higher, averaging ~168. To avoid stockouts which have occurred in 5 of the last 7 periods (ending on-hand inventory = 0), I am setting mu_hat to use the last 11 samples (covering the new regime) to capture the higher mean, and sigma_hat similarly to account for the increased volatility. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand remains 0, so the order will be driven by the pipeline inventory (472 units across P23-P26) against the base stock calculated by the backend.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is approximately 121.75 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~80. Recent periods (P24-P26) have seen spikes reaching 167-169 units, though P27 dropped slightly to 111. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced several stockouts in recent periods (P25-P27) due to this increased demand and lead-time constraints. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and align with the higher demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the detected shift since Period 16. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained higher volume and volatility seen in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P16-P27): average demand approximately 122 units (+50% vs original baseline), with frequent spikes near 170 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Since Period 16, demand has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 122 units throughout this period, with significant spikes frequently exceeding 160 units. The most recent demand (Period 28) was lower at 77 units, but the overall trend since Period 16 remains elevated. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory depleted and high demand volatility, I will use recent_N (N=13, covering the start of the regime shift at P16 to P28) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand levels and volatility (sigma) to better protect against stockouts during the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from a baseline of ~80 to an average of ~115-125 units per period. The recent history (P16-P29) confirms this higher mean, with frequent spikes reaching over 160 units. Although the average from P16-P29 is approximately 119, the volatility is notable. I am using the recent 14 periods (P16 to P29) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to capture this new elevated regime while ensuring enough samples for statistical stability. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (arriving in Period N+4, visible in N+5). The inventory position shows high in-transit units (441) due to aggressive ordering in the wake of stockouts, so the OR backend will moderate the order based on the 'cap' and current pipeline to avoid excessive holding costs while attempting to restore service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-31.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 16 from a baseline of ~80 to a significantly higher average. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 120 units, with high volatility and several spikes exceeding 160 units. Recent demand in the last 5 periods has averaged 113.8 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P26 order arriving at P30). With on-hand inventory at 135 and 368 units in-transit (reflecting recent large orders from P27-P30), the system is currently recovering from previous stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the sustained higher demand regime since Period 16, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to account for the increased variance in this period. L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time has been consistently 4 units when observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 16 confirmed at an average of ~120 units (previously ~80), with high variance and peaks >160.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is consistently higher than the initial baseline, with an average of approximately 120 units per period. Recent periods (P29-P31) show demand of 109, 104, and 120, suggesting the volatility remains but the mean is stable around 120. The current on-hand inventory is 180 units, and the pipeline inventory is 301 units. Total system inventory (481) compares well against the expected demand over (L+1) = 5 periods (roughly 600 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 to capture the entire higher-demand regime starting from Period 16, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility. L remains at the default/promised 4 periods since all recent deliveries align with this.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a baseline of ~80 to a new average of ~120. Analysis of the 17 periods since the shift (P16-P32) shows a mean demand of approximately 120.3 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) show a slight cooling with an average of 102.6, but given the high variance and previous spikes toward 170, it is safer to maintain the higher mean estimate for mu_hat to avoid stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the full extent of the new regime since Period 16, which provides a robust sample size while excluding the outdated lower-demand history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 120 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~80. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 118.4 units with significant variance (peaks >160). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to use a 10-period lookback (N=10) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this established higher-demand regime while allowing for the observed volatility. With a critical ratio of 0.5 (Profit=1, Holding=1), the target service level is 50%, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean demand over the (L+1) horizon. The OR backend will calculate the order size by considering the 421 units in-transit and 59 units on-hand against the calculated base stock.

Since Period 30, the demand has been slightly lower but still remains within this higher regime (P31: 120, P32: 103, P33: 116, P34: 90). The average for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 106.6 units. I will use recent_N (N=19, from Period 16 to 34) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand regime while maintaining some sensitivity to the volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P30 arrived in P34, lead_time=4). Inventory is currently healthy with 74 on hand and a large in-transit pipeline (458), which the OR backend will use to calculate the appropriate order size to maintain the base stock level.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an initial average of ~80 to a higher regime. Since Period 16, the average demand has been approximately 119 units, with recent periods (P31-P35) showing a consistent average of 107.6 units despite historical spikes over 160. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 53, and there is a robust pipeline in-transit (415 units). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime (starting P16). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=20 to account for the increased volatility seen in the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent historical performance of the logistics chain.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 115-120 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~80. Recent demand (P31-P36) shows a stable average of 110.3 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently 474 (59 on-hand + 415 in-transit). Given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level base stock. I will use recent_N (N=20) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the statistics of the current high-demand regime while excluding the very early low-demand data. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the sustained increase in demand and the associated volatility (~110-120 mean).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 from an average of ~80 to ~120 units. Since Period 30, demand has stabilized further, with the last 8 periods (P30-P37) averaging 108 units. I will use a window of the last 8 samples (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized higher demand regime while smoothing out the earlier spikes seen in the P24-P26 period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the history (e.g., P33 order arrived in P37), so I will use the 'calculate' method for L to maintain this observed average. With profit=1 and holding_cost=1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target using these updated demand parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 30 has stabilized at a slightly lower but consistent average of ~108 units (compared to the P16-P29 average of ~120), with reduced volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted since Period 30, stabilizing at a slightly lower average than the previous peak regime (P16-P29). Over the last 9 periods (P30-P38), the average demand is approximately 109 units (104, 120, 103, 116, 90, 119, 114, 101, 114). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical arrivals. To account for this stabilized regime, I will use a recent window (N=9) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to better reflect current consumption and volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the inventory needs for 5 periods (L+1) under the current demand profile while avoiding overstocking from the previous higher-variance regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 108 units since Period 30, following a more volatile regime (P16-P29) which averaged ~120 units. In the most recent periods (P34-P39), demand has been 114, 77, 114, 101, 114, 77, averaging approximately 99.5. Given the target period is 40 of 50, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stabilized regime (avg ~105) while accounting for the recent slight softening of demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all concluded shipments since Period 5. The pipeline inventory is high (406 units) relative to the on-hand stock (62), which is normal for a 4-period lead time. No shipments are currently missing; the order from P36 (120 units) is expected to arrive next period (P40).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 30) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the extremely volatile Period 16-29 window. Since Period 30, the average demand is approximately 107 units per period (1180 units / 11 periods), with lower variance than the preceding peak but still higher than the initial baseline (~80). The observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 89, In-transit: 347) totaling 436 units is sufficient to cover approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average, but with the pipeline inventory being distributed over the lead time, I will use a N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. The holding cost vs. profit is 1:1, implying a target service level (q) of 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend policy will aim to keep inventory at roughly the expected demand over the replenishment cycle.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 102 units over the last 12 periods (P30-P41), showing a slight decrease and lower volatility compared to the high-activity period (P16-P29). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since P30, demand has hovered between 77 and 120 units. I am using recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The on-hand inventory is 115 and in-transit is 326 (covering orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41), ensuring the base stock level is well-managed for the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 30 has stabilized at an average of ~102 units (P30-P41), showing lower volatility compared to the P16-P29 regime (~120 units).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 30. Analyzing the demand from Period 30 to Period 42, the average is approximately 100 units per period (1301 total units / 13 periods = 100.07). The volatility in this recent regime is noticeably lower than the previous spike-heavy period (P16-P29). Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture this specific regime. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the game, with the most recent arrival (P38 order arriving in P42) confirming this stability. I will continue using 'calculate' for L. Given the reduced volatility, 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=13 will provide a more efficient inventory buffer, avoiding overstocking while maintaining the required service level. Current on-hand (109) and in-transit (340) units are sufficient to cover the expected demand throughout the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volatility regime since Period 30. Analysis of the demand from P30 to P43 shows an average of approximately 100 units per period (Sum[P30-P43]=1315, 1315/14 = 93.9 units, but looking at the most recent 10 periods, the average is ~93). In the most recent period (P43), demand was 89. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from P38 and P39. With on-hand inventory at 137 and in-transit at 274, the total pipeline is 411 units. Given the desired base stock calculation (L+1 periods of demand), and the profit/holding cost ratio being equal (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock is approximately 5 * 94 = 470. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=14 to capture the stabilized demand regime since Period 30, and 'calculate' for lead time as it has been stable at 4.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime since Period 30. Analyzing the window from Period 30 to Period 44 (15 periods), the average demand is approximately 101.6 units per period, consistently lower than the high-volatility Period 16-29 regime (~120 units). The most recent demand (P44) was 115, but the overall trend since P30 is lower with reduced variance. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history. Currently, we have 83 units on-hand and 299 units in-transit (orders from P41, P42, P43, P44). Given the profit/holding ratio (1:1), the backend OR logic will target a 50% service level (z=0), effectively aiming for the mean demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the recent_N method with N=15 to capture the stable mean and variance of this current regime (P30-P44) while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level (~102 units) starting from Period 30, following a high-volatility period (~120 units). Recent demand (P41-P45) averages ~85 units, suggesting a potential further softening as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (Decision for P46, arrivals through P50), I must ensure coverage for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 98 and in-transit is 331, totaling 429 units. At an average demand of ~95 (balancing the regime shift with very recent lower figures), we need roughly 475 units to cover the remaining game (5 periods). The OR backend's capped policy will handle the order size, but I will set mu_hat using the last 16 periods (representing the stable regime since P30) to provide a reliable mean estimate (~102), and \u03c3\u0302 will be calculated over the same period to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime since Period 30, with an average demand of approximately 100 units per period and reduced volatility compared to the earlier spike (Periods 16-29). Most recent demand (P46) was 114. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P42 order in P46. With the game ending at P50, and a promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 47) would arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, the goal is to manage the current on-hand (58) and the large in-transit pipeline (321) to cover demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50). Total units available (379) divided by 4 periods is ~94.75 units/period, which aligns closely with the mean demand of the current regime (~100). Ordering more now would likely only increase ending inventory and holding costs for the final period without the possibility of the order arriving in time to be sold. I will maintain parameters consistent with the current regime (N=17, covering P30-P46) to ensure the backend recognizes we are sufficiently stocked for the remaining duration.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The demand regime has stabilized since Period 30 at an average of approximately 102 units with lower volatility compared to the previous high-demand spike period (P16-P29). Recent demand (P40-P47) averages approximately 93 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (Decision Phase 48, 49, 50), the order placed now in P48 will arrive in P52 (post-game), and subsequent orders will also arrive after the game ends. Therefore, maximizing current reward depends on efficiently using the 25 units on-hand and the 389 units in-transit. Since the in-transit inventory is extremely high (nearly 4 periods of demand), the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size to zero or near-zero to minimize holding costs for the final periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the stable regime since P30) to provide the most accurate baseline for the backend's current inventory calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 30, the demand has stabilized around an average of 102 units (P30-P41) or slightly lower in more recent snapshots (P42-P48 average is ~93). However, volatility remains present. The current on-hand inventory is very low (1 unit), while in-transit is high (383 units). Given the target service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) and the objective to minimize ending inventory (holding costs), I will use the recent demand regime (starting P30) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. N=19 covers the period from P30 to P48, encompassing the most relevant stable regime. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the inventory position based on the most recent mean and variance while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime that began around Period 30. Analysis of the demand from Period 30 to Period 49 shows an average of approximately 99.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5 units. This is a slight decrease from the high-volatility period observed between P16-P29 (avg ~120). Lead time has remained consistently at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 26 units and in-transit inventory at 376 units, current pipeline levels are adequate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture this stable regime (P30-P49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The back-end OR will factor in the lead time L+1 (5 periods) to determine the base stock, ensuring we cover demand while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (targeting a ~50% service level/median demand coverage).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30 to 49 has stabilized at an average of ~99 units (std dev ~16.5), lower and less volatile than the P16-P29 peak.
