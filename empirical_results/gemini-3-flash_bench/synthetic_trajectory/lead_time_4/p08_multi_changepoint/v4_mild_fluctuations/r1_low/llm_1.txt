The product is 'chips(Regular)', which usually has stable but somewhat volatile demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Because current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is 4, any order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and be available for customers then. To minimize lost sales while accounting for the ~4 period lag (Total pipeline needs to cover Demand during Lead Time + Review Period, approx 5 periods), I need to calculate a target inventory level. Average demand is ~86. Target for 5 periods = 86 * 5 = 430. Since there are no units on-hand or in-transit, I will order 430 units to establish the pipeline.",

The promised lead time is 4 periods. Based on the logic 'Order placed in Period N arrives during Period N+L, visible P+L+1', the P1 order (L=4) should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6. This means I will face a total of 5 periods (P1-P5) of stockouts before the first shipment arrives. Total pipeline (550) already covers approximately 6-7 periods of demand (76/period * 7 = 532). Since current stock is 0 and demand is occurring, I must bridge the gap until the P1 shipment arrives. However, since P1 won't arrive until Period 5 (at the earliest), and I already have 550 in the pipe, I will be overstocked if I order more now, given the high holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0).

The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Currently, we have 102 units on hand and a substantial pipeline of 760 units in transit. The expected arrival for Period 31 (ordered P27) is 410 units, which creates a significant risk of high holding costs if demand remains near the 110-140 range. My goal is to maintain a pipeline that covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 862. If average demand is ~135, we need approximately 675 units in the pipeline for 5 periods.

Given the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, any order placed today (P44) will arrive at the start of P49. We must cover demand for P44, P45, P46, P47, and P48 (5 periods) with current stock and the existing pipeline. Estimating demand at 100 units per period, 500 units are needed. Total current inventory + pipeline is 362 + 270 = 632 units. This surplus suggests significant holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) if more is ordered. With only 7 periods remaining in the game (ending P50), and already having enough stock to cover nearly 6 periods, no additional order is placed this period to maximize profit by reducing holding costs.",

Current on-hand inventory is 367 units, with an additional 150 units in transit (ordered P43, expected arrival P47). Demand analysis shows a recent moderation to an average of ~82 units (P39-P43), though P44 saw a slight increase to 115. Summing the forecasted demand for the remaining periods (P45-P50) at a conservative average of ~100 units/period yields 600 units. Total pipeline inventory is 517 units (367 on-hand + 150 in-transit). Considering the game ends at Period 50, any inventory exceeding demand by Period 50 results in unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period), which equals the profit margin per unit ($1). Therefore, holding excess stock is as costly as a stockout in terms of net reward at this stage. Given we have 517 units to cover roughly 550-600 units of potential demand, and significant on-hand stock (367) that will incur holding costs until sold, no further orders are placed to minimize the holding cost burden during the final periods.",

Any order placed in Period 46 will arrive during the arrival phase of Period 50 (46+4=50) and can only satisfy demand for Period 50. Orders placed after Period 46 will arrive after the game ends and are worthless. Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 294. In-transit consists of 150 units ordered in Period 43, which are expected to arrive in Period 47. Therefore, total inventory available for the remaining 5 periods is 294 (current) + 150 (incoming P47) = 444 units. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has moderated, with a 5-period average (P40-P44) of ~87 units and Period 45 demand at 73. Using an estimated average demand of 90 units/period, the total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50) is 90 * 5 = 450 units. My total supply is 444 units. To perfectly cover the expected demand and avoid ending with excess inventory that incurs holding costs, I only need to order enough to bridge the small gap and maintain a buffer for the final period (Period 50). An order of 50-100 units would arrive in time for P50, but since I have 444 units and only 5 days of 90-unit demand, I am very close to balanced. I will order 50 units as a safety measure for the final period to avoid lost sales, while prioritizing minimal ending inventory to avoid holding cost penalties on the final day.",

The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by historical arrivals (e.g., Period 37 order arrived in Period 41, Period 40 order arrived in Period 44). This means an order placed now in Period 47 will arrive during Period 51, which is outside the scope of this 50-period game. Therefore, the inventory already on-hand (180 units) and in-transit (200 units) must cover the total demand for the remaining periods (47, 48, 49, and 50). Looking at historical data, the recent demand regime (P41-P46) averages approximately 90 units per period (83, 66, 89, 115, 73, 114). Total expected demand for the final 4 periods is roughly 360 units (4 * 90). The current inventory position is 180 (on-hand) + 150 (due P47, ordered P43) + 50 (due P50, ordered P46) = 380 units. This total pipeline of 380 units is sufficient to cover the estimated 360 units of demand without incurring excessive holding costs on the final day or risking a stockout. Since any order placed now (P47) arrives at the start of P51 (theoretically), it cannot contribute to sales within the game's duration. Therefore, no further orders should be placed to maximize profit and minimize terminal holding costs.",

Recent demand has been moderated; the average demand from P43-P47 is approximately 95 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 3 periods is approximately 285 units (95 * 3). Our current on-hand inventory of 246 units, plus the in-transit shipment of 50 units (ordered in P46, scheduled to arrive in P50), brings our total available stock to 296 units. This is sufficient to cover the expected remaining demand of ~285 units. Even if demand spikes slightly, ordering more now provides no benefit as it cannot arrive before the game ends.

Current on-hand inventory is 41 units. Historical demand suggests demand in Period 50 will likely range between 75 and 115 units. Since on-hand inventory (41) is already lower than expected demand, a stockout is likely, and the ending inventory for Period 50 (which determines the final holding cost) will be 0.
