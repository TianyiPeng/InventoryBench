Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or 'conclude' messages yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no demand data yet, I will use the baseline statistics provided in the historical samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). The mean of these 5 samples is 85.8 and the standard deviation is 25.7. My goal is to set the base stock to cover demand during the risk period (L+1 = 5 periods). Therefore, mu_hat should be approximately (1+4) * 85.8 = 429, and sigma_hat should be sqrt(5) * 25.7 \u2248 57.5. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this initial distribution. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to establish a pipeline and reach the required service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and 128 units were ordered. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we did not expect any arrivals this period (actual lead time will be confirmed in later 'conclude' messages). However, demand was 87 units, all of which were lost (sold=0) because on-hand inventory was 0. For Period 2, we are still waiting for the Period 1 order to arrive (estimated Period 5 or 6). I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. Since we only have one period of history (87 units) and seeding data (84, 55, 79, 85, 126), the mean demand across the 6 available samples is roughly 86. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to establish a baseline using all available samples (N=6), which is appropriate for the early stage of the game.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (128 units) and Period 2 (124 units) are currently in-transit (total 252). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand (Period 1: 87, Period 2: 86) cannot be met. Demand samples provided (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a mean of 85.8. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Total pipeline target should be around 429 units. Existing in-transit is 252. The OR backend will calculate the order based on the base stock minus pipeline. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent mean demand including the user-provided samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 1+4=5. Therefore, the 'Period 4 conclude' message (visible at the start of Period 5) is the first time we should expect to see any arrivals. Currently, On-hand is 0 and we have recorded lost sales because demand occurred before the first possible arrival. The total in-transit quantity is 376 (orders from P1, P2, P3). Historical demand samples are [84, 55, 79, 85, 126] for the first 5 periods (though period 5 is current/future in terms of decision making, the prompt provided it in the data block). The mean of the first 4 samples is 78.25. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. mu_hat target should be 5 * 78.25 = 391.25. Sigma calculation over the first 4 periods is approximately 14.1. For 5 periods, sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 14.1 \u2248 31.5. I will use the default methods as there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation or a sustained shift in demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5, but we won't see confirmation of this until the start of Period 6 (the 'Period 5 conclude' message). As of right now, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 455 units in-transit (representing orders from Periods 1-4). Since the first order's promised arrival is only just occurring this period, there is no evidence yet that the lead time is anything other than the promised 4 periods, nor is there evidence of lost shipments. Regarding demand, the samples for periods 1-5 are [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. Period 5 shows a notable spike to 126, while the previous four were relatively stable around an average of 76. Given this recent jump, I will use EWMA for mu_hat with a gamma of 0.3 to respond to the potential upward trend while maintaining some stability. For L and sigma_hat, I will use the default methods as historical data is still limited and no physical arrivals have been confirmed yet to justify a calculation-based lead time shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the start of Period 5 after a lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. This provided 128 units, of which 58 were sold in Period 5, leaving 70 on-hand at the start of Period 6. There are 327 units currently in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 3, and 4), which are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [87, 86, 62, 80, 58], averaging 74.6 units. There is a slight downward trend, but N=5 is a small sample size. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full history while staying sensitive to the most recent behavior. The lead time L will remain 'default' as the one observed delivery (L=4) aligns with the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Observing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). This confirms the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. Demand for the last 5 periods (P2-P6) has been {86, 62, 80, 58, 86}, with an average of 74.4. The initial demand samples provided (P1-P5) were {84, 55, 79, 85, 126}, showing slightly higher volatility. Given the stability around the mean of ~75-80, I will use a recent window of N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, which includes a high spike of 126 in Period 5. With L=4, mu_hat will cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). Current pipeline inventory (205) + on-hand (108) = 313, which is sufficient for ~4 periods of demand, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary top-up based on the 5-period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current demand is stable with an average around 81 units (P1-P7: 87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77). The on-hand inventory is 155, and in-transit is 166 (sum of orders from P4, P6, and P7). With L=4, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 405 units. Combined inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 321. I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean demand from all 7 available sample periods (approx 76.5 per period, or ~383 for L+1) to maintain a steady order flow while accounting for the high on-hand quantity.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed actual lead time is 4 periods based on P1-P3 arrival data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by orders from P1 through P4 arriving exactly 4 periods later (P1 in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7, P4 in P8). Currently, we have 157 units on hand and 198 units in transit (ordered in P6, P7, and P8). The demand has been relatively stable, with Recent_5 demand being (58+86+77+77+X)/5, but I will use a larger sample to capture the broader trend since P1. The mean demand across all 8 concluded periods is approximately 76.6 units per period. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Projected demand for this window is ~383 units. Current inventory + in-transit is 157 + 198 = 355 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for L since it aligns with the promised and observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' to incorporate all available historical data (8 samples plus initial context) to ensure a stable base stock calculation as the demand variance has been moderate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 74. From the history, we observe that orders from Period 1 to Period 4 all arrived with a lead time of 4 periods. The order placed in Period 5 was 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 9. This confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised. Historical demand from Period 1 to Period 9 is [87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77, 77, 83]. The average demand is approximately 77.3 units per period. With a lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using all available samples (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a stable estimate given the relatively consistent demand pattern. Since on-hand (74) and in-transit (277) total 351 units, and 5 periods of average demand is ~387, the system needs to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at zero on-hand inventory. Looking at the arrival history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10 all show 4 periods). However, there is a missing arrival for the order placed in Period 5. Period 5 had an order of 0 units, which explains why 'Period 9 conclude' showed arrived=0. In Period 10, we received the order from Period 6 (2 units), but because demand (95) exceeded on-hand + arrival (74+2=76), we are currently stocked out. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 331) consists of orders from Periods 7 (85 units), 8 (111 units), 9 (79 units), and 10 (56 units). Expected arrivals for Period 11 (ordered P7) is 85 units. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 10 samples (including provided pre-history and game history) being: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126, 87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77, 77, 83, 95. The mean of the last 10 game periods is approx 79.1. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand levels and keep L at default since 4 periods is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to demand exceeding supply in the last two periods. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P6 arrived P10, P7 arrived P11). We are currently missing the arrival from Period 5 (ordered 0, which is a non-event), and notably, no shipment was recorded for Period 5 because the order was 0. The next expected arrival is from Period 8 (111 units), which at lead time 4 should arrive during Period 12 and be visible in the Period 12 conclude message. Historical demand is relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaging 84.8 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability while maintaining a lead time value of 4 to ensure the OR backend covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (P5 through P12) consistently shows an actual lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in P5 and P9 are conspicuously missing/missing from the 'conclude' messages (P5 should have arrived by P9, P9 should have arrived by P13). However, looking closely at P9, 'ordered=79, arrived=0' indicates the P5 order (ordered=0) would have resulted in 0 arrival anyway. The real concern is that P10 saw a stockout because the P6 arrival was only 2 units. Demand has remained relatively stable, with a mean around 80. The current on-hand inventory is 40 units, and there are 320 units in transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). Since 320 units in transit represents roughly 4 periods of demand (~80 * 4), the pipeline is healthy, provided they arrive. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4) and use the most recent 7 periods of demand (P6-P12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the slightly higher demand seen recently (avg ~83) compared to the initial samples.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 80.2 units per period. The confirmed lead time (L) is 4 periods, meaning we must cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Demand appears stable with no recent regime shifts; however, stockouts occurred in Period 10 and 11 due to a skipped arrival in Period 9 (Order from Period 5). Period 9's order was for 0 units, which explains the zero arrival in Period 13. My current on-hand (33) and in-transit (313) total 346. Base stock targets should be roughly (1+4) * 80.2 = 401. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full stable history since the start of the simulation, and 'default' for L as it matches the observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns detected; demand remains stable around 80 units/period and lead time is consistent at 4 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current on-hand inventory is 0. Period 14 ended with a stockout (89/90 demand met). Historical demand remains relatively stable. The mean demand for the last 14 periods is approximately 78.4 units per period. The standard deviation for the same period is 12.0. The promised lead time is 4, and consistent with carry-over insights and historical arrivals (P1-P4, P6-P10), the actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we have consistently seen 4-period lead times, I will set L to 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the period-to-period demand is fairly stable around 80, so I will use a recent window (recent_N=10) to capture the current mean more precisely (average demand P5-P14 is approx 82). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect recent volatility. The base stock calculation in the backend (covering L+1 = 5 periods) should aim for roughly 410 units (82 * 5) to maintain the service level effectively given the high profit/holding cost ratio (q = 0.8).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current state shows 0 units on-hand and 343 units in-transit. Based on historical data from periods 5 through 15, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the carry-over insights and recent arrivals from orders placed in periods 6-11). There are no missing shipments, although the system experienced stockouts in periods 10, 11, 14, and 15 because demand (ranging from 86 to 97) slightly exceeded the arriving stock and existing inventory. The average demand across all historical samples (15 periods) is approximately 81.3 units, but recent demand (last 6 periods) has trended slightly higher, averaging around 84.5 units. Given that the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the recent stable but slightly higher demand trend and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead time is consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Recent demand in Period 16 spiked to 138, significantly higher than the previous average of ~80. This suggests a potential demand shift or a seasonal peak. The actual lead time L=4 is well-established. Since we are out of stock and demand just jumped, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this upward movement (average demand last 5 periods: 100.4), while keeping sigma_hat reflective of the increased volatility (last 5 periods). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5 periods (L+1) required to cover lead time and the current period's demand. The OR backend will order to reach a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed at Period 16 (138 units, +70% vs prior average), potentially signaling a new regime or seasonal peak.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift starting at Period 16 (138 units) and continuing at Period 17 (99 units), compared to the previous stable average of ~80 units. This suggests a new demand regime or seasonal peak. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the last three periods (P15-P17). The promised and actual lead time remain consistent at 4 periods. To address the increased demand and prevent further lost sales, I am shifting from using the full history to a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) to capture the higher mean and variance of this new regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period lead time. Mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to prioritize the most recent demand spikes (Periods 13-17) in the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 avg demand increased to ~118 units vs historical ~80 (+47%), leading to consecutive stockouts.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 138, 99, and 129, averaging approximately 122 units per period. This is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~80 units. We have encountered consecutive stockouts since Period 14, and specifically in Period 18, we sold only 75 units despite a demand of 129 because of insufficient on-hand inventory. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover from back-to-back stockouts and meet the new demand levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this 122 units/period average, which across (L+1)=5 periods equates to approximately 610 units. This will trigger the OR backend to place larger orders to refill the pipeline and ensure base stock levels are sufficient for the higher volatility (sigma_hat) observed in this new regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 138, 99, 129, and 106, averaging ~118 units per period, compared to the previous historical average of ~80. The inventory status shows 0 units on-hand due to consecutive stockouts (the last 5 periods had 0 ending inventory). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since L=4, we must provide parameters that cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this new elevated regime (P16-P19 avg multiplied by 5). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 will also reflect the increased volatility seen in this new period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~118) sustained for 4 periods (P16-P19), resulting in persistent stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted from a historical mean of ~80 to a higher regime (~118) starting at Period 16. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has been 138, 99, 129, 106, and 126, which averages 119.6 units per period. Despite increased ordering, on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to 5 consecutive periods of stockouts. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. To recover and meet this sustained higher demand level while balancing a profit (4.0) to holding cost (1.0) ratio (critical ratio q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the new demand mean. L is set to default (4), and sigma_hat will also be based on the recent 5 periods to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand for the period P16-P21 is approximately 119.67 units, compared to the previous average of ~80 units. This higher demand level (ranging from 99 to 138) has been sustained for 6 periods, confirming a new steady state or a seasonal peak. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of orders from P12 through P17). Despite recent stockouts, Period 21 finally showed a small ending inventory (19 units) following a large arrival (138 units). To maintain service levels in this new regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21). L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time. Using recent_N helps the OR backend adjust to the 120-unit mean while accounting for the increased volatility observed during this spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed and sustained through Period 21: avg increased from ~80 to ~120 units (+50%).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~80 to ~120 units. However, Period 22 observed a significant drop to 59 units. Given the sustained high demand from P16-P21 (avg ~118), it is safer to treat P22 as a potential outlier or a slight cooling rather than a full return to the previous regime. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this higher-demand regime while including the P22 data point. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to maintain enough inventory to cover the lead time (4) + current period (1) = 5 periods of demand at the new higher average (~110-120), while reconciling the 478 units in-transit and 89 on-hand.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 16. Previously, mean demand was ~80 units; from Period 16 to 23, the mean is ~111 units (138, 99, 129, 106, 126, 119, 59, 102). Period 22's low demand (59) appears to be an outlier within this new high-demand regime rather than a return to the previous level. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains well-supported by consistent arrivals (P19 arrived at P23). Current status: On-hand is 143 units, with 360 units in-transit. To maintain a sufficient base stock for the (L+1)=5 period horizon, I will use a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the period of the new regime (N=8, from P16-P23) to capture the increased mean and volatility. Lead time is set to default as the actual 4-period lead time matches the backend's promised lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 16. Previously, mean demand was ~80 units; from Period 16 to 24, the mean has risen to approximately 112 units (samples: 138, 99, 129, 106, 126, 119, 59, 102, 136). Although Period 22 saw a dip to 59, recent demand levels (P23=102, P24=136) suggest the high-demand regime is sustained. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (L=4). To set the OR parameters, I will use a window of the last 9 periods (N=9, corresponding to the regime shift at P16) to capture this higher mean and the increased volatility observed in this period. Setting L to 'calculate' lets the backend use the consistent 4v-period history. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 ensures the base stock reflects the ~50% increase in volume and the higher standard deviation of the current regime, protecting against further stockouts while accounting for the recent inventory recovery (on-hand is now 98).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~80 to ~112 units (~40% increase) sustained through Period 24.

Daily Reward (R_t): $617.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the demand values are [138, 99, 129, 106, 126, 119, 59, 102, 136, 166]. This averages to approximately 118 units per period, compared to the pre-P16 average of ~81 units. Although Period 22 saw a dip (59), the subsequent periods (Period 24 and 25) have shown very high demand (136 and 166), suggesting that the high-demand regime is not only sustained but potentially increasing or becoming more volatile. The current 'on-hand' inventory is 47 units, and the lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), we must ensure a high service level. To capture the current regime and recent volatility, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (covering the period since the shift began) to allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the ~118 mean and the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed and sustained through Period 25: mean increased from ~81 to ~118 units (~45% increase). Recent periods (P24-P25) show demand acceleration (136, 166).

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand averaged around 81 units (P1-P15). Starting at Period 16, demand increased to an average of ~118 units. More recently (P24-P26), demand has shown further volatility and acceleration (136, 166, 91), indicating a higher mean and significantly higher variance. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the system should target a critical fractile of 0.8. Since demand is currently in a high-growth/high-volatility phase, I will use a conservative recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am selecting N=11 for mu_hat (P16-P26) to capture the entire 'new regime' period, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the higher base stock requirements of this ~118-120 unit average vs. the previous ~81. For sigma_hat, I will use N=11 to capture the increased volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent through Period 26: mean increased from ~81 to ~116; volatility has increased significantly in the most recent 5 periods (std dev approx 35 vs historical 15).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 16. In the most recent 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand has risen to approximately 116 units, up from the initial baseline of ~80. Furthermore, volatility has increased significantly in the last 5 periods (std dev ~32). The current inventory state is low (on-hand = 5), and we rely heavily on the pipeline (522 units) which is consistent with the 4-period lead time. I am using recent_N=12 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this higher regime while maintaining some stability, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the recent spike in volatility (P24: 136, P25: 166, P27: 105). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $287.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 16. While earlier periods averaged ~81 units, the average from Period 16 to Period 28 is approximately 112 units. Recent volatility has been high (standard deviation ~31 since P16), with demand ranging from 59 to 166. In the last three periods (P26-P28), demand has cooled slightly (91, 105, 77), but significant stockouts occurred as recently as P25. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 21 units on hand and 534 in transit (covering roughly 4.7 periods of demand at the 112-unit rate), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=13, covering the start of the high-demand regime) to capture the current mean while smoothing recent noise. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=13 to reflect the increased volatility of this regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1) at current regime levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-28 is confirmed at mean ~112 units (up from ~81, +38%) with increased volatility (std dev ~31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $539.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a mean of ~81 to a higher, more volatile state. From P16 to P29, the average demand is approximately 114 units, but recent volatility is high (standard deviation ~29). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since my lead time is 4, I must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With demand accelerating in some recent periods (P25 at 166, P29 at 142) and a cluster of high demand, I will use the last 14 samples (starting from the changepoint at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current regime accurately. The on-hand inventory is low (29), but in-transit is healthy (441), which should arrive over the next 4 periods to meet the increased demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $465.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the high-demand regime from Period 16 to Period 30, the mean demand is approximately 119 units per period (standard deviation ~26). The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (promised = actual). Period 30 data confirms this regime continues with a demand of 132. The current on-hand inventory is 63, and there is a significant pipeline of 428 units. To ensure the base stock levels reflect the higher sustained demand and increased volatility seen since Period 16, I will use a recent_N approach with N=15 (covering Period 16 upwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of this higher demand regime while accounting for the increased variance to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained high-demand regime P16-P30: mean ~119, std dev ~26. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. In the last 15 periods (P16-P31), the mean demand is approximately 116 units with a standard deviation of roughly 26. Recent demand (P24-P31) has averaged ~123 units, showing sustained high volume. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (promised lead time). Based on the most recent regime length (starting P16, length 16 periods), I will use recent_N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this higher mean and increased volatility while filtering out the lower pre-regime-shift data. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is consistently higher than the initial phase. Data from P16 to P32 shows a mean of approximately 117 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 25. The most recent demand (P29-P32) shows values of 142, 132, 136, and 115, maintaining this elevated level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, meaning we must plan for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=17 (covering the shift since P16) provides the most representative mu_hat and sigma_hat for the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the pipeline and on-hand needs to prevent stockouts while balancing against the $1/unit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 32 confirmed: Mean ~117 units (+44% over baseline), Standard Deviation ~25 (~60% increase in volatility).

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand spiked to 158 units, exceeding our starting inventory (87) and resulting in a stockout. The demand regime from Period 16 onwards is confirmed with a higher mean (~117) and increased volatility (~25-30). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current pipeline inventory (545 units) comprises orders from Periods 30, 31, 32, and 33. Given the order of operations, the Period 30 order (153 units) will arrive during Period 34 AFTER the decision phase, followed by Period 31 (137 units) in Period 35. Our goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current decision period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N (N=18, covering the regime start at P16) to capture this higher demand and volatility while ensuring the OR backend targets the appropriate service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) to mitigate further stockouts.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~80 to ~117. In the most recent periods (P29-P34), demand has shown significant volatility with values ranging from 79 to 158. Period 34 demand was lower at 79, but given the high service level requirements (profit $4 vs holding $1), we must maintain protection against the higher end of the distribution observed in the P16-P34 range. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand (74) and in-transit (492) are relatively high, but significant arrivals are needed to cover the 5-period window (L+1). I will use N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire high-demand regime since Period 16.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 35, the mean is approximately 117 units with a standard deviation of roughly 27. This represents a significant shift from the initial baseline (around 80 units). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on 'Period conclude' messages (e.g., P31 order arrived P35). Currently, on-hand inventory is 99 units and in-transit is 425 units. Since the total lead time plus review period (L+1) is 5 periods, the required coverage is approx 117 * 5 = 585 units. Existing inventory (99 + 425 = 524) is slightly below this, but the OR backend's base-stock calculation will adjust for this gap. I am using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the full breadth of the current high-demand regime (P16-P35) while excluding the low-demand start.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~81 to ~116 units with increased volatility. Since Period 16, demand has fluctuated significantly, with recent periods (P33-P36) showing 158, 79, 112, and 57 units. This indicates high variance despite the average holding. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy (184 units), but with a lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure the pipeline (current on-hand + 393 in-transit) covers the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the sustained change in both mean and variance since Period 16, I will use a recent_N method with N=21 (covering Period 16 to Period 36) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this higher-demand, higher-volatility regime while ignoring the initial low-demand baseline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 16 from a baseline of ~80 to a higher mean of ~115-120 with increased volatility. Since Period 33, demand has leveled out but remained in this higher regime (P33-P37 demand: 158, 79, 112, 57, 120; Mean: 105.2). The current on-hand inventory is healthy (177) and we have a significant pipeline (327). Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across the entire history (L+1=5 periods). I will use the recent regime (last 22 periods since P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the sustained higher average and increased variance compared to the initial baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P34-P38: 79, 112, 57, 120, 94) shows a decrease in both mean and volatility compared to the high-demand period (P16-P33). The current average demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 92.4, down from the previous regime's ~117. On-hand inventory is healthy at 183 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked (347 units), representing roughly 3-4 periods of demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the cooling demand, I will transition to a more recent lookback window (N=10) to reflect this normalization while still accounting for recent variance. This will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering as we enter the final 10 periods of the game, reducing holding cost risk while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the current ~90-100 unit/period demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilizing: Mean demand from Period 34-38 has decreased to ~92 units (from ~117 in the P16-P33 regime). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following the high-volatility peak seen between Periods 16-33. From Period 34 to 39, demand has averaged approximately 93 units (79, 112, 57, 120, 94, 94), which is lower than the previous regime (~117) but higher than the initial baseline (~81). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 159 and 378 units in transit (expected arrivals over the next 4 periods), we are well-covered. I will use a recent_N approach for both demand (mu) and volatility (sigma) using N=6 to capture this current stable regime while filtering out the older high-demand noise. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is extremely stable.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 34. The average demand from Period 34 to 40 is approximately 91.2 units (79, 112, 57, 120, 94, 94, 85), which is significantly lower than the preceding high-demand regime of ~117 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 40. With 184 units on-hand and 268 units in-transit (total pipeline of 452), and a target base stock of roughly 547 units (5 periods * ~91.2 units plus safety stock), the current inventory position is healthy. However, to avoid overstocking as the game nears its end (Period 50), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Mean demand from Period 34-40 is 91.2 units, a decrease from the previous ~117 unit regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime following the peak observed between Periods 16-33. From Period 34 to 41 (8 periods), the mean demand is approximately 91.2 units, which is significantly lower than the previous ~117 unit average. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 143 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 267 units. To prevent overstocking and keep holding costs manageable while the demand is lower, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this stabilized demand regime. This will align the base stock level with the current consumption rate of ~91 units per period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 34. For the last 9 periods (P34-P42), the mean demand is approximately 89.6 units (calculated from: 79, 112, 57, 120, 94, 94, 85, 88, 77), which is a significant drop from the ~117 units seen during the P16-P33 peak. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 186 and in-transit at 230, the pipeline is well-stocked. To reflect the recent stable demand while acknowledging the volatility observed (std dev of ~20 in this recent period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (recent_N=9). This will prevent over-ordering as the game approaches its conclusion in Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Mean demand from Period 34-42 is 89.6 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~117 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 34. For the last 10 periods (P34-P43), the mean demand is approximately 89.3 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 18.5. This is a significant drop from the high-demand regime (P16-P33) where demand averaged ~117 units. The current on-hand inventory is 212 units, and there are 197 units in-transit, totaling 409 units of pipeline inventory. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current mean, 5 periods of demand is ~447 units. The backend's base-stock calculation will use my parameters to determine if the current 409 units are sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stabilized regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time L remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple cycles of arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stabilization (P34-P43): Mean demand ~89.3 units, significantly lower than the P16-P33 peak of ~117 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 34. The mean demand from Period 34 to 44 is approximately 89.3 units, a significant decrease from the peak regime of ~117 units observed between Periods 16 and 33. The most recent demand (P44) was 91 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by historical arrival data. Although Period 44 conclude shows 0 arrivals, this is consistent with the order placed in Period 40 being 0. Pipeline inventory (263 units) plus current on-hand inventory (121 units) is 384 units, which comfortably covers the expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon (approx 450 units total, but with high existing stock). I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=11 to capture this stable 'new normal' regime (P34-P44) and align with the lower average (~89) to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a 0.8 service level (implied by profit $4 vs holding $1).

The P44 '0' arrival represents the fact that no order was placed in Period 40 (ordered=0), so 'arrived=0' is expected for that slot. Calculating mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture this stable period (P34-P45) yields approximately 447 units for the 5-period window (1+L=5). Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N to reflect the recent volatility. We maintain L at the promised 4 periods as observed lead times remain consistent when orders are actually placed.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stabilized within the current regime that began around Period 34. The mean demand from Period 34 to 46 is approximately 91.8 units, with a standard deviation of 15.6 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as seen in the delivery of P42's order in P46). The order from Period 40 (0 units) did not arrive in Period 44 (as expected based on lead time), but this is logically consistent with an order size of zero. Pipeline inventory is currently high (346 units), while on-hand inventory is low (32 units). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering P34-P46) to capture this stable post-peak regime and prevent over-ordering relative to the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization regime P34-P46 confirmed: Mean ~91.8 units, Std Dev ~15.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $355.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~91.8 units since Period 34, with a standard deviation of ~15.6. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (9 units), and although in-transit inventory is high (392 units), we must ensure continuous coverage as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50). The order from Period 40 (0 units) did not result in an arrival in Period 44 as expected, but this is consistent with the order size. The order from Period 41 arrived in Period 45, and Period 42 arrived in Period 46, confirming the 4-period lead time is still active. I will use a recent window of 14 periods (P34-P47) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a stabilized regime since Period 34. Analyzing the most recent data (P34-P48), the mean demand is 92.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Although P48 saw a higher demand of 124, it remains within the expected volatility range for this regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current period (P49) is the penultimate period and on-hand inventory is 0, the goal is to maintain sufficient stock to cover demand for the final two periods (P49 and P50) while managing the pipeline of 415 units. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to reflect this stabilized post-peak regime (P34-P48).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization regime P34-P48 confirmed: Mean ~92.5 units, Std Dev ~17.5. P48 demand of 124 is a high-side outlier but consistent with recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $309.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be in a stabilization regime that began around Period 34. For the most recent 16 periods (P34-P49), the mean demand is approximately 91.8 units. The observation from Period 48 (124 units) was a high-side outlier but demand returned to 80 units in Period 49. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods, as evidenced by consistent arrivals (e.g., P45 order arriving at P49). Given the date is Period 50, I will maintain parameters based on this stabilized regime to balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost. Using recent_N with N=16 captures the post-spike stabilization period (from P34 onwards) for both mean and volatility.
