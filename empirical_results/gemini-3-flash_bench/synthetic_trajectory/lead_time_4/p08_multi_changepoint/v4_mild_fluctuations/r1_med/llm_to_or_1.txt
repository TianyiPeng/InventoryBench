Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance yet, but we are provided with 5 prior demand samples for 'chips(Regular)': [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. The average demand of these samples is 85.8 and the standard deviation is 25.4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since the backend computes base_stock for (1+L) periods of demand, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (current period + 4 periods lead time). I will use 'default' for L to start with the promised lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' which calculates the mean and standard deviation from all available historical samples (seeds). This provides a baseline until we observe actual lead times and current period demands.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 128 units, which are currently in-transit. Because the lead time is >= 1, the order has not arrived yet, resulting in 0 sales and 98 lost demand units for Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows Period 1: 84, P2: 55, P3: 79, P4: 85, and P5: 126. Note that the 'Period 1 conclude' message lists a demand of 98, which differs slightly from the sample provided (84), suggesting high variance or a slight upward shift. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time of 4, our 'pipeline inventory' covers us for the L+1 window, but we need to ensure the OR backend parameterizes for the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and standard deviations to capture the most relevant recent volatility while staying within the sample limit.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from Period 1 and 2 are still in transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, we expect the Period 1 order (128 units) to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Total demand so far (P1: 98, P2: 62) has resulted in lost sales due to zero starting inventory. Historical demand for the first 5 samples shows significant variance (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Currently, 260 units are in transit. The mean demand of the 5 samples is 85.8. For mu_hat, using the mean of all available history (N=5) covers the expected demand trend without overreacting to the single high P5 sample (126). For sigma_hat, using the full historical record is appropriate to capture the standard deviation over the lead time. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, we adhere to the promised lead time L=4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived' remains 0 in the history until Period 5 is concluded. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 389 units in-transit (128 from P1 + 132 from P2 + 129 from P3). Demand over the first 3 periods was 98, 62, and 68. Period 5 demand was provided in the historical samples as 126. Since the lead time is L=4, my parameters need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The total in-transit quantity of 389 units covers approximately 3 periods of historical demand (avg ~76/period). I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent samples, while keeping the lead time at 'default' (4) until actual arrivals provide evidence for a different L.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (128 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (this period). However, because arrivals occur after the decision phase, the confirmation of this arrival will only be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 488 units in-transit (orders from Periods 1-4). Demand has been relatively consistent, with a mean of 81.4 units over the first 5 samples (including the provided sample for Period 5: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126; average = 85.8). The demand in Period 5 (126) shows a significant spike. Given the lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for Period 5 plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the recent upward trend in demand and the default calculation for lead time until we observe actual arrivals to confirm any deviation from the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order placed in Period 1 (128 units) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the lead time is exactly 4 periods (5 - 1 = 4). Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 84, 55, 79, 85, 126 (average 85.8). Demand resolving in Period 5 (after arrival) was 84, leaving 44 units on hand. Current in-transit inventory is 371 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), meaning we have 132+129+99+11 = 371 units expected between Periods 6 and 9. Total coverage (on-hand + pipeline) is 415 units. Over a 5-period horizon (L+1), expected demand is ~429 units. The Period 5 demand spike (126) suggests a potential upward trend or high variance. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the full recent history and 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Concluded shipments from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly in 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6), confirming that the actual lead time currently matches the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 6 periods has been [98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56], averaging 77.3 units per period. Period 5 saw a slight spike, but Period 6 returned to lower levels. Using all samples (N=6) provides a stable estimate of the mean and volatility. Current inventory is 120 on-hand with 271 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Since L+1=5, and average demand is ~77, the base stock should target ~385 units. Total pipeline (120+271=391) is currently well-positioned. I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' with all available samples to maintain this steady state.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 & P2 orders both arrived in 4 periods).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 8. Historical demand samples (Period 1 to 7) are: 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85. There is no clear trend or seasonal spike visible yet; the average is approximately 78.4 units per period. The lead time (L) is confirmed to be 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving exactly in 4 periods. Since L=4, my parameters need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all available historical samples (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as the demand regime appears stable. On-hand inventory is 164 and in-transit is 172, providing a healthy pipeline against the expected demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a steady lead time of 4 periods, consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1 through 4. Demand shows a rising trend with the most recent sample at 115, compared to an early average of ~78. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P5-P8) average 85 units, but the jump to 115 suggests a potential upward shift or increased volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the latest demand profile while being responsive to the uptick. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect current demand variability. Lead time L is set to 'default', as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4 periods. The current pipeline (161) plus on-hand (148) is 309 units, which is roughly 3.6 periods of the recent average demand; the OR backend will decide if more is needed to reach the base stock target for L+1 (5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely starting Period 8: demand increased to 115 (+35% vs prior 7-period average).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on observations from P5 to P9. Demand analysis shows a potential increase starting around P8. Demand history: P1(98), P2(62), P3(68), P4(96), P5(84), P6(56), P7(85), P8(115), P9(88). The average of the last 5 samples is 85.6, while the average for P8-P9 is 101.5. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent slight uptick in variability and mean while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 due to the change in demand volatility. Lead time L is set to default (promised 4) as observations consistently align with the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P10). Demand analysis shows a potential regime shift starting P8, but recent demand dropped significantly in P10 (39 units), contradicting the earlier spike observed in P8 (115 units). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 79.1 units. Given the volatility (P8 was high, P10 was low), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the recent fluctuations while weighting the most relevant data. Since L=4, the engine needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. On-hand is 64 and in-transit is 363 (ordered P7-P10). These arrivals are expected in P11-P14. The parameter selection ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the recent average demand and volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical evidence. Demand analysis shows a recent shift; while Period 8 and 9 saw higher demand (avg ~101.5), Periods 10 and 11 decreased significantly (39 and 76). The rolling average for the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 79.5, which is close to the long-term average (80.1). However, since we are moving into the central part of the game and inventory is currently low (on-hand: 18), I will use the last 5 periods (P7-P11) to capture the recent volatility more accurately. \u03bc\u0302 will be calculated using recent_N=5 (avg 80.8), resulting in a forecast of (1+4)*80.8 = 404 for the lead time cycle. \u03c3\u0302 will also use recent_N=5 to react to the increased variance observed between periods 8 and 11. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand, while the OR engine's service level logic (q = 0.8) manages the inventory cost-profit tradeoff.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Analysis of the history shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history shows two distinct phases: Periods 1-7 had an average demand of approximately 78.8 units, whereas Periods 8-12 have shown higher volatility and an average demand of 79.0. Although a previous insight suggested a regime shift at Period 8, current data suggests a return to mean with high variance (demand recently dropped to 76 and 77 in periods 11 and 12). With 29 units on-hand and 349 in-transit, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N (N=5) for demand allows us to capture the recent volatility. Setting L to default as observations confirm it is stable at 4.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 8-13) shows an average demand of approximately 81.5 units, which is a shift from the earlier observed trend. Specifically, between Period 8 and 13, demand values were [115, 88, 39, 76, 77, 94]. While Period 10 was an outlier (39), the general level is slightly higher than the very first periods. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by all arrivals through Period 13). With (L+1) = 5 periods to cover, and an average demand around 81 per period, mu_hat should target approximately 405. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma (N=6 to encompass the period since the last regime shift mention) allows the OR backend to adapt to this recent variability while maintaining the confirmed 4-period lead time. On-hand is 60 and In-transit is 293 (total 353), which is slightly below the target of ~400-450, so the backend will likely trigger an order.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history from Period 8 to Period 14 shows a stable but higher average demand than the initial 7 periods. Excluding the outlier of 39 in Period 10, the demand consistently fluctuates between 76 and 115. The average of the last 7 samples (Period 8-14) is approximately 84.8, which is slightly higher than the promised lead time expectations. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival from Period 5 through Period 14. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (Periods 8-14). Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 275) plus On-hand (85) totals 360 units, which covers roughly 4.2 periods of the current average demand (85 units/period). Given L=4, the backend needs to cover L+1 (5) periods, so it will likely place a small replenishment order to reach the target base stock. The profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) suggests a service level (q) of 0.80, which the OR backend will use to determine the safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 15 periods. Although a regime shift was suspected in Period 9, the average demand from Period 8 to 15 is approximately 80 units (80.1), which is very close to the overall average (79.2). Thus, the initial suspected shift did not persist as a higher mean. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Period 16 starts with 42 units on-hand and 365 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15 are expected in P16, P17, P18, P19 respectively). To maintain a proper base stock covering L+1 (5) periods, I will use recent history (N=8) to capture the current variance and mean, which accounts for the recent slight fluctuations (e.g., P8 demand spike followed by lower P10 and P15). This provides a representative sample of the current demand pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shows a recent spike in Period 16 (133 units), confirming a shift towards higher volatility or a new demand level compared to the earlier baseline. Historically, lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the consistent 'lead_time was 4 periods' in the conclusion messages from Period 5 through Period 16). With the current on-hand inventory at only 1 unit and 311 units in transit, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the regime shift starting around Period 8, providing a more responsive forecast to the recent higher volume and variance without overreacting to the single Period 16 spike. Lead time L is kept at the default (promised = 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in Period 16 (133 units), continuing the high-demand regime observed since Period 8 (avg ~90-100 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of stockout (Ending Inventory Period 17 = 0) following a demand of 95 units, where only 70 could be fulfilled. On-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P13 arrived in 4 periods). Since Period 8, a new demand regime has been established with higher mean and volatility. In the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the average demand is roughly 87.7 units, but recent volatility (P16: 133, P17: 95) suggests we need to be more responsive. I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this recent regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation (which targets a service level around 80% given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1) accounts for the higher volume and recent stockout risk. The high In-transit amount (375 units) includes the large orders placed in P14 (102), P15 (102), P16 (38), and P17 (133). The P14 order is expected to arrive during the current period (P18 resolution).

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred Period 17 (sold 70/demand 95) due to high recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the system is recovering from a stockout in Period 17. The current on-hand inventory is very low (7 units), although a large amount (383 units) is in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every shipment since Period 5, so L is set to 'calculate' to use this historical average. Regarding demand, a regime shift was identified around Period 8, and volatility increased significantly in Period 16 (133 units). The demand since Period 8 has averaged approximately 93 units per period. To account for this higher demand and increased volatility while avoiding further stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the period from Period 8 to Period 18). This focuses the backend OR engine on the current high-demand, high-variance regime rather than the lower initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand and volatility, with a severe stockout occurring in Period 19 (demand was 166, only 109 units sold). Demand has shifted upwards significantly, averaging approximately 114 units over the last 5 periods (P15-P19: 55, 133, 95, 95, 166), compared to the earlier regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. To address the stockouts and higher demand level, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime and volatility. This will increase the base stock level to better cover the (L+1)=5 period demand window while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory and ordering caps.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike confirmed in Period 19 (166 units), the highest recorded to date. Five-period moving average (P15-P19) is now ~114 units, up from the ~90-100 unit range previously noted.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a consecutive stockout (P17, P19, P20 on-hand exhausted) due to a sustained upward shift in demand and increased volatility. The most recent demand (P19: 166, P20: 115) confirms the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (P15-P20 average ~113 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P16 order arriving in P20). To capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime, I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will adjust the base stock to cover (L+1) periods using the higher mean (~113) and the increased volatility observed since Period 15, ensuring the backend places sufficiently large orders to recover inventory levels and mitigate ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 15-20 average is 113.1 units, significantly higher than the early-game average (~80). This has led to three stockouts in the last four periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While the early-game average was ~80 units, the average from Period 15-21 is approximately 112.5 units (55, 133, 95, 95, 166, 115, 109). We have experienced three stockouts in the last five periods (P17, P19, P20) due to this increased demand and higher volatility (standard deviation of ~35 during the high-demand phase). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 21 (Order from P17 arrived in 4 periods). To ensure enough stock covers the L+1 (5 periods) duration, I am using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand mean (~112.5 * 5 = 562.5) and N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance. This will help the OR backend set a higher base stock to improve service levels and prevent further stockouts.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a higher regime since Period 15, with an average of approximately 119 units per period (P15-P22). Significant volatility and several stockouts (P17, P19, P20) necessitate a higher base stock. The five-period moving average through P22 is 108 units, but given recent spikes (166 in P19, 133 in P16), I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (regime starting at P15) to capture this sustained increase while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect historical performance, mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 to focus on the high-demand regime, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 to account for the increased volatility observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high since Period 15: Average demand (P15-P22) is ~119.1 units (standard deviation ~32). This represents a ~40% increase over the initial baseline (~85).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 has sustained a higher level and increased volatility (Period 15-23 average ~115 units, compared to the early-game average of ~85). Previous stockouts in Periods 17, 19, and 20 were driven by this shift and the 4-period lead time delay. Order arrivals are consistent with the promised 4-period lead time. With an on-hand inventory of 47 and a robust pipeline (469 units), I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (P15-P23) to capture this 'high-demand' regime. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 9 samples to account for the increased volatility (e.g., the 166-unit spike in P19), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $619.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-regime state since Period 15. The recent demand (Period 24) of 169 units matches the previous spike in Period 19 (166 units), confirming that volatility remains high. The average demand from Period 15 to 24 is approximately 124 units per period, a substantial increase from the early game (~85 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. To prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the last 10 periods (Periods 17, 19, 20), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (recent_N=10) to capture this sustained high average and increased variance. This ensures that the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) covers the (L+1) period horizon based on the current regime's performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 15-24 confirmed high average (~124 units) with significant volatility (spikes > 160 units). Service levels have been inconsistent, necessitating parameters keyed to this recent 10-period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $640.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 25 is approximately 126.4 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 36 units. This is a substantial increase from the initial game average of ~80. The recent five periods (P21-P25) have seen even higher volatility and demand, with three periods exceeding 160 units (P24: 169, P25: 167, P19: 166). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 25. To handle this high-demand/high-volatility regime and maintain a high service level (given the 4:1 Profit/Holding cost ratio), I will use the last 11 samples (P15-P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current sustained high-demand level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 15-25 confirmed high average (~126 units) with extreme spikes (>165 units). Recent trend (P24-P25) shows demand consistently exceeding 165 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward since Period 15, with very high demand observed in the most recent periods (P24: 169, P25: 167, P26: 168). This follows a previous shift identified around Period 8. The average demand since Period 15 is approximately 130 units, but the last three periods show a sustained level closer to 168 units. Consequently, the inventory is currently at 0 units on-hand, leading to stockouts in P25 and P26. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and align with this high-demand scenario, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 (representing the regime since Period 15) to capture the higher mean and increased volatility, while maintaining lead time at the 'calculate' level to account for the consistently observed 4-period delivery time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand plateau confirmed: Period 24-26 demand averaged 168 units, significantly higher than the already elevated P15-P23 average (~119). Parameters must continue to prioritize the recent high-volume regime (P15-present) to recover from consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 15 and intensified significantly from Period 24 onwards. Over the last four periods (P24-P27), demand has averaged 153.75 units (169, 167, 168, 111), which is much higher than the initial baseline of ~80. This has resulted in a critical stockout situation (on-hand inventory is 0 for the last three periods). While the most recent demand was 111, the average of the last 13 periods (P15-P27) is approximately 119 units, and the average of the last 4 periods is ~154 units. To recover from stockouts and prevent future ones, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the high-demand regime) to ensure the base stock levels are calculated against the elevated demand and volatility environment. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (avg ~120-150 units) confirmed since Period 15, leading to recurrent stockouts when ending inventory hits 0 in P25, P26, and P27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains highly volatile with a sustained high-regime average around 120-130 units since Period 15, occasionally spiking above 160 units (P24-P26). We are currently experiencing a string of stockouts (P25-P28) because arrivals (from lower historical orders) are insufficient to cover this newer demand level. With Period 29's on-hand inventory at 0 and a large pipeline (602 units), the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock level to provide a buffer against these volatility-driven stockouts. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the high-demand regime starting at P15) to ensure the backend projects the (1+L) demand using this elevated mean and variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P15-P29) has been characterized by a high-demand regime with significant volatility, averaging 115.5 units per period. While Periods 28 and 29 showed slightly lower demand (77 and 109 units), the system just recovered from four consecutive periods of stockouts (P25-P28). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 62 units with a large pipeline of 487 units. To optimize, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (the duration of the current high-demand regime) to ensure the OR backend captures the elevated mean and variance compared to the early-game data. 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time. This setting balances the need to maintain service levels for regular chips while accounting for the high levels of stock currently in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a higher mean after a period of extreme volatility and spikes. Following a series of stockouts between Periods 25-28, the inventory position has finally recovered due to large arrivals from orders placed in the high-demand phase. Current on-hand inventory is 137, with a healthy pipeline. Examining the last 15 periods (since the regime shift identified in Period 15), demand has averaged approximately 120 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) have seen a slight cooling to an average of about 114 units. Given the high stockout risk experienced previously, I will use a 15-period lookback (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime relative to the early game, while allowing recent moderate demand to prevent over-ordering and high holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $289.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-demand regime established since Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 117 units over the last 16 periods (P15-P31). Recent demand (P28-P31) has stabilized somewhat around 102 units, but significant spikes (up to 169 units) are frequent in this category. We are currently in a recovery phase following multiple stockouts between P25 and P28. On-hand inventory is now healthy at 191 units, and the pipeline is robust (351 units). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a high service level (80% quantile). I will use a recent_N of 17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire high-demand regime starting at P15, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the observed volatility while preventing excessive overstocking as demand appears to be plateauing around the 110-120 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 15-31 confirmed high average (~117 units) with significant volatility. Recent 5-period average (P27-P31) is 104.2 units, indicating a possible slight cooling from the extreme peaks (160+) seen in P24-P26.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 118 units. While there were extreme spikes in Periods 24-26 (averaging ~168), the most recent five periods (P28-P32) show a slight moderation, averaging 102.6 units. To avoid the recurrent stockouts seen previously while managing holding costs, I am shifting from modeling the extreme spike towards this more sustainable high-demand average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the high-demand regime from P15 to P32) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~118) and the significant volatility (std ~29) inherent in this period. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods, so I will continue using 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical performance (all deliveries have arrived in exactly 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains significantly higher than the initial baseline, with an average demand of approximately 119 units and high volatility. While the extreme spikes (>160 units) seen around Period 25 have somewhat subsided, the recent 5-period average (P29-P33) is 110.4 units, confirming a sustained elevated level compared to the early game. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 106, with 418 units in transit. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the critical fractal (q) is 0.8, requiring a service level that protects against stockouts during the lead time + review period (5 periods total). I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 19 periods (since the major shift at P15) to capture this higher mean and volatility while smoothing out the extreme P24-P26 peaks. L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times have consistently been 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high-demand regime that began roughly at Period 15, with a more recent peak period (P24-P26) followed by a slight cooling. The 5-period average (P30-P34) is approximately 106.6 units, while the average since P15 is ~116.5 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 120 units, and there are 429 units in-transit (orders from P31-P34). I will set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime since Period 15 (covering 20 periods from P15 to P34). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=20 to factor in the high volatility observed during this regime, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen earlier in the game.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high-demand regime that began significantly around Period 15, with a more extreme peak between Periods 24-27. Recent demand (P31-P35) has averaged 106.4 units, which is slightly lower than the extreme peak but significantly higher than the early game average. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (114 units), and the pipeline is substantial (399 units). I will use a N=10 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized high-demand regime (averaging ~105-110 units) without over-reacting to the extreme volatility of Periods 24-26, while still maintaining high service levels to avoid the stockouts seen in earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P31-P35 indicates stabilization at a high level (avg ~106) following the extreme volatility of P24-P30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 15, with an average of approximately 117 units. Most recently, from Period 31 to 36, the average demand is 114 units with a standard deviation of approximately 13 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With only 14 periods remaining in the game (ending at Period 50), I need to maintain a service level that prevents the stockouts observed in the Period 17-28 range while managing holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is 104 units, and in-transit is 386. I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the current stabilized demand levels (P31-P36) for setting mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 31, consistent with the previous insight (avg ~106). The most recent 5-period demand (P33-P37) average is 104.8 units (116, 90, 119, 114, 101), showing less volatility than the extreme peaks of P24-P26. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 100 units, and the pipeline (373 units) is well-aligned with expected demand across the lead time. Given the stabilization, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering P31-P37) to capture this stable high-demand state while filtering out earlier extreme volatility. Service level remains prioritized due to the high profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1), which the OR backend will handle via the critical ratio calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 31-37 average demand is approximately 106.3 units with reduced volatility compared to the P24-P30 window.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 31, averaging approximately 107.5 units per period (P31-P38) with significantly lower volatility compared to the earlier peak (P24-P26). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 101 units and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 352 units, the system is well-positioned. Using a 7-period lookback window (recent_N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat accurately captures this stabilized high-demand level while ignoring the historical extreme spikes that would otherwise inflate the safety stock and holding costs unnecessarily. The backend will use these parameters to maintain the base stock level relative to the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a relatively consistent high-demand regime following the extreme volatility seen between Periods 24-30. Over the last 9 periods (P31-P39), the mean demand is approximately 106 units with a significantly lower standard deviation compared to earlier spikes. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory (107) plus in-transit units (377) provides a healthy buffer against the expected (L+1) demand of ~530 units. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime (Period 31 to 39) while filtering out the previous extreme outliers, ensuring the OR backend maintains a high service level without excessive holding costs.

Recent demand (P31-P40) averages 105.7 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. Period 40 demand was 93. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting parameters to reflect this established stability to optimize inventory levels and avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining service levels. I am choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent and consistent performance window.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 101.4 units over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), down from the extreme peaks seen in the P24-P30 window. The current on-hand inventory is 106 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 362 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals occurring exactly 4 periods after ordering. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the backend needs to maintain a service level of approximately 80%. Using a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will capture this recent stabilization and slightly lower volatility while providing enough buffer for common demand fluctuations in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 32-41 average demand is 101.4 units, reflecting a cooling from the Period 24-30 peaks and aligning closer to the Period 15-23 regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable, moderately high regime after the extreme volatility seen between Periods 24-30. Since Period 32, demand has averaged approximately 101.4 units (P32-P42), a decrease from the earlier peak but higher than the initial baseline of ~80. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 134 and in-transit units remaining high (333), the inventory position is healthy. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=11 (Periods 32-42) to capture this stabilized 'post-peak' behavior, which prevents over-ordering based on old spikes while maintaining sufficient stock for the current ~100-unit average demand.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~90-100 units following the extreme volatility seen in the Period 24-30 window. The most recent 10-period average (P34-P43) is 95.6 units, while the 5-period average (P39-P43) is 81.6 units, showing a slight downward trend or 'cooling'. Given the on-hand inventory of 153 and in-transit inventory of 281 (total pipeline of 434), and the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, we are well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period horizon (expected demand ~450-500). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the stable regime starting roughly at Period 32, which balances the recent lower demand with the stabilization period mean to avoid over-ordering as the game approaches its conclusion.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 32-43 mean is 97.1 units, significantly lower than the P24-P30 peak (~120+). Volatility has also normalized.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 13 periods (P32-P44) with a mean of approximately 97 units and significantly lower volatility compared to the earlier peak period (P24-P30). Recent demand (P44) was 115, following a series of lower values (89, 66, 83). The current inventory position is healthy with 112 units on-hand and 291 in-transit. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=13 to capture this stabilized regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 4, which is consistent with all observed arrivals.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since approximately Period 32. Calculating the mean demand from Period 32 to Period 45 results in approximately 95 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 45) was 73 units, following 115 in Period 44, which is consistent with the stabilized mean of ~95 and the moderate volatility observed in this window. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 45 (ordered P41, arrived P45). With on-hand inventory at 125 and a significant pipeline of 327 units, the current stock position is healthy. Setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=14 (P32 to P45) captures this stable regime effectively, while recent_N for sigma_hat ensures the backend accounts for the current level of volatility to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs as the game nears completion (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P32-P46) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 95 units, significantly lower than the extreme peaks seen in the P24-P30 period. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15, roughly P32-P46) to capture this current normalized demand regime. This avoids being over-sensitive to the old P24-P30 volatility while maintaining a higher service level than the early-game baseline. The current inventory position (on-hand 76 + in-transit 327 = 403) is healthy relative to the expected demand of ~475 over the (L+1) period horizon, allowing the backend to smoothly bridge the gap towards the end-of-game (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly since Period 32. The average demand from Period 32 to Period 47 is approximately 96.6 units, with a standard deviation around 17.5 units. This is a noticeable cooling from the peak volatility seen around Period 25. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current 'on-hand' inventory is 48, but the 'in-transit' pipeline is very healthy at 391 units (which includes large orders from P44-P47). To avoid over-ordering as we approach the end of the game (Period 50), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the stable regime since Period 32, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for this more moderate mean and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the simulation is nearing its end (Period 50). The current demand regime has stabilized following the high-volatility period (P24-P30). The average demand over the last 15 periods (P33-P48) is approximately 95 units, significantly lower than the extreme peaks of 160+ units but higher than the initial baseline of ~80. The most recent demand (P48) was 110 units. On-hand inventory is low at 22 units, but pipeline inventory (in-transit) is very high at 386 units, reflecting large orders placed recently (P45=122, P47=120). Given the lead time of 4 periods, these large orders will arrive starting in Period 49 and 51, respectively. To avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods while ensuring the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable 'recent' regime of the last 15 periods (N=15). This captures the current mean (~95) and normalized volatility. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally limit new ordering because the pipeline inventory (386) is already very high relative to expected demand over the lead time (4+1 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $331.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 15+ periods following a peak in the P24-P30 window. Analyzing the most recent data (P32-P49), the average demand is approximately 93 units per period. The Promised Lead Time of 4 periods remains accurate and consistent, with every order since Period 1 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The system currently sits at a lower 'on-hand' inventory (49 units) but has a healthy 'in-transit' pipeline (370 units). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1, suggesting an 80% service level target), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 18 periods (P32-P49) to capture the current stable-but-lower demand regime compared to the mid-game spikes. L will remain at 'default' (4), and sigma_hat will use the same recent window to reflect normalized volatility.
