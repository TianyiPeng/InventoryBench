Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data yet other than the provided 5 seeds (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). The mean of these seeds is 85.8 and the standard deviation is 25.8. Promised lead time is 4. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat which will utilize all available samples (the seeds) and the promised lead time (L=4). Setting L to default ensures we cover the 4-period lead time plus the 1-period review cycle (L+1=5).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 128 units was placed, which is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5. Consequently, we had zero starting inventory and could not fulfill any of the 98 units of demand in Period 1, resulting in 98 lost sales. The historical data shows demand samples ranging from 55 to 126. Since we have only experienced one active game period and the initial stock was zero, we must continue to build inventory towards the target base stock. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on provided historical samples [84, 55, 79, 85, 126], the mean is roughly 85.8. For 5 periods, the expected demand (mu_hat) is approximately 429. I am using 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to calculate the initial parameters from the available data pool, which will adjust the order to account for the current 128 units in-transit.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 (totalling 255 units) are correctly shown as in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 (L=4). Demand for the first two periods was 98 and 62 (average 80). Since we are currently stock-out with 0 on-hand, we need to maintain a robust base stock to cover the lead time (L) plus the current review period (1). With only 2 data points of historical demand, it is too early to determine a new regime. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which utilize the available samples. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (Start of Period 6). Therefore, current stockouts and zero arrivals are expected behavior. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. The most recent sample (126) suggests a potential upward shift or high variance. Given total in-transit is 378 units (orders from P1, P2, P3: 128+127+123), the pipeline is well-stocked for the promised lead time. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and variance to capture the recent spike while maintaining steady coverage for the (L+1) window.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 508 units are in-transit (P1: 128, P2: 127, P3: 123, P4: 130). Historical demand samples are [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. There is a noticeable upward shift in Period 5 demand to 126, compared to the previous average of ~76. While this might be a spike, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent increase while maintaining the promised lead time (L=4) to ensure the pipeline is correctly calculated for the (L+1) horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1552.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [84, 55, 79, 85, 126] (based on provided 'Historical Demand Data' snippet), while the 'Game History' reflects actual observed demand of [98, 62, 68, 96, 84]. The mean of the visible game history demand is 81.6 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 5, the order from Period 1 arrived, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Currently, we have 44 units on hand and 380 units in transit (ordered in P2, P3, P4). Since the promised lead time holds (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Average demand (1+L) * 81.6 = 408. My current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 424, which is slightly above the expected bash stock requirement. I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately after the initial startup periods.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $949.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift starting around Period 5. The mean demand for Periods 1-4 was approximately 81, whereas Periods 5-6 averaged around 70, but the initial provided samples showed Period 5 demand as 126. Re-evaluating historical demand data: P1: 84, P2: 55, P3: 79, P4: 85, P5: 126 and concluding messages show P5 demand was 84 and P6 was 56. There is some variance, but the mean is currently around 85. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (promised = actual). Total demand to cover is (L+1) = 5 periods. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.95, which requires a high service level. Current status: On-hand 115, In-transit 297 (Orders from P3, P4, P6). I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the overall demand average and volatility while acknowledging the confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1462.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we currently have 153 units on-hand and 215 units in-transit. The demand history (Periods 1-7) averages 78.4 units per period (98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85). However, the initial demand samples provided for Periods 1-5 (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) differ from the 'conclude' messages, suggesting a higher volatility or a shift. I will prioritize the 'conclude' history as it represents the ground truth for this simulation. The mean demand of the last 7 periods is approx 78.4. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). 5 * 78.4 = 392 units. Current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 153 + 215 = 368 units. The system is slightly understocked relative to the target base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mean and sigma to capture the specific demand trend observed since the start, and 'default' for L since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2017.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms that actual lead time is indeed 4 periods (orders from P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). Current on-hand is 168 and in-transit is 171. The demand history across 8 periods shows a mean of 83 units/period (98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115). Period 8 saw a spike to 115, but there isn't enough sustained evidence for a regime shift yet. I will use L=4 and set mu_hat based on the average of all available demand samples (N=8) to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock level covering (1+L)=5 periods of demand. This approach provides enough buffer for the lead time while minimizing unnecessary holding costs given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1592.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). No order was placed in P5, which explains why 'arrived=0' in P9; however, the order from P6 is expected to arrive during P10. Demand has stabilized over the last 9 periods with a mean of ~83.5 units. The current on-hand inventory is 80, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 288. To maintain the target service level (95% critical ratio based on $19 profit and $1 holding cost), I will use the last 5 periods of demand history (P5-P9) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as P1-P4 show zero sales due to stockouts but provide valid demand samples. Using N=5 for demand captures the recent mean of ~85.6 units and prepares for the 5-period cycle (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $656.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10 concludes) confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. The order from Period 5 is notably missing (should have arrived in P9 conclude), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. However, the order from Period 6 arrived exactly on time in Period 10, indicating the lead time of 4 remains stable for successful shipments. Demand shows a significant shift starting around Period 8; the initial 5 periods had a mean of 81.8, while the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a mean of 76.6 with a notable drop in the most recent period (P10=39). Given the missing shipment from P5 (approx 0 units arrived), on-hand inventory is 85, and in-transit is 364. To maintain high service levels while accounting for the recent drop in demand and the lead time of 4, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime and stick to the default lead time which aligns with the observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential lost shipment: Period 5 order (0 units) did not arrive in Period 9 as expected. Subsequent order from Period 6 arrived on time in Period 10.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 80 units/period (last 11 periods: ~79). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on concluded periods 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11. Although the order from Period 5 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival in Period 9, the orders from P6 and P7 arrived correctly in P10 and P11. Currently, on-hand inventory is 50. Total in-transit is 367, which covers the expected demand for the lead time pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods * ~80 = 400). The current in-transit plus on-hand (417) is slightly above the base stock requirement for stable demand. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the overall demand distribution and use the default lead time (4) as it has been consistent.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12). Note that the Period 5 order of 0 units was technically 'lost' or not applicable, but subsequent orders arrived as scheduled. Demand has remained relatively stable: the mean demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 79.7 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), the mean is 79.2 units, indicating no major regime shift. Therefore, I will use L=4 (promised/calculate), and a 12-period lookback (recent_N) for demand (mu) and volatility (sigma) to capture the stable baseline. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring sufficient on-hand inventory while accounting for the current in-transit pipeline (338 units).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 82 units with 293 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is consistently observed in successful arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13). The order from Period 5 is definitively lost, as it did not arrive by Period 9 and subsequent orders have arrived. Recent demand over the last 8 periods (since the lead-time arrival stabilization) averages 78 units. Given upcoming demand needs to be covered for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), the base stock level targets approximately 390 units. Current pipeline (82 + 293) is 375, which is close to the target. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current demand mean of 78 (total 390 for 5 periods) and default for others to allow the OR backend to balance the service level with the observed lead time of 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (last 5 periods: 88, 39, 76, 77, 94, 95) shows a mean demand of approximately 78 units per period, which is lower than the early period demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed for non-lost orders (P6 arrived in P10, P7 in P11, P8 in P12, P9 in P13, P10 in P14). A shipment from P5 appears lost, but subsequent shipments arrived on time. I am using recent_N=9 for demand estimation (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the current demand regime which seems to have stabilized after some volatility. L is set to default as the lead time is performing as promised (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $949.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a fluctuating but relatively stable pattern. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has been [76, 77, 94, 95, 55], averaging 79.4. Including the early periods (P1-P5) and the middle sequence, the overall mean is approximately 79.8. I will use a recent_N of 10 periods (P6-P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the most relevant variance after the initial startup phase and reflects the consistency of the demand. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P1-P4, P6-P11) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. While the P5 order (which was 0 units anyway) didn't result in an arrival, it hasn't disrupted the delivery cycle for subsequent periods (P6-P11 orders arrived exactly on time). Thus, L=4 remains the most accurate estimate. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Current on-hand is 96, with 335 in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15), covering the pipeline for the next 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2507.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 13-16) shows a slight upward trend, particularly Period 16 with a high of 133 units. The 5-period average (Periods 12-16) is 88.8 units, while the 10-period average is 77.2 units. Given the recent spike, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this upward movement in the forecast. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across almost all successful deliveries. There was one lost shipment from Period 5 (ordered 0 units essentially, or failed to arrive), but since then, deliveries have been stable at 4 periods. With L=4, mu_hat needs to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) will allow the OR backend to adjust to the increased volatility and mean observed in the most recent window while maintaining the 4-period lead time assumption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1748.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 95 units, and we had a stockout (sold 92, 0 units on-hand), following a high demand period in P16 (133 units). The current in-transit inventory is 387 units, consisting of orders from Periods 14 (97), 15 (109), 16 (43), and 17 (138). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the observation that arrivals are consistently concluding at L=4 (e.g., Period 13 order arrived in Period 17), we expect the Period 14 order (97 units) to arrive during Period 18 and be visible in Period 19. The demand history shows a mean around 83 units, but recent periods (16 and 17) have seen a spike (avg 114 over those two). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the recent upward trend and variance without being overly reactive to a single outlier. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time remains stable and confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1803.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current on-hand inventory is extremely low (2 units), and a stockout occurred in Period 17. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met for delivered orders, although a shipment from Period 5 was lost. The demand over the last 18 periods has averaged approximately 86 units, with Period 16 showing a spike to 133 units. Since we must cover (L+1) periods of demand (5 periods), and the current pipeline is 420 units (covering roughly 4.8 periods of average demand), we need to maintain a steady order flow to replenish the on-hand stock and prevent future stockouts. Demand shows moderate volatility (std dev approx 24), so I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (excluding the zero-starting periods 1-4) to capture the stable demand regime while accounting for recent variability. L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2109.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend recently, with the last period (P19) reaching a peak of 166 units, compared to a historical average around 80-90. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is approximately 122 units. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 402 units in transit, but we just experienced two stockouts in the last three periods due to this demand spike. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To ensure we capture this growth and minimize lost sales (which are much costlier than holding costs given the $19 vs $1 margin), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to highlight the shift. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased volatility accompanying the demand spike. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4 as deliveries have been consistent with that timeline since the lost shipment in P9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~85 to ~122 (+43%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 21. Data since Period 16 confirms a significant demand regime shift: average demand has increased from ~85 to ~121 (samples: 133, 95, 95, 166, 115). Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0) with a high stockout risk, as demand is frequently outstripping arrivals. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent 'conclude' messages (P12-P16 orders arrived in P16-P20). To capture the recent higher demand level and ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock to cover (L+1) periods (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to focus on the current regime. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Significant sustained demand increase since Period 16 (avg ~121 vs ~85 previously).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2042.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a higher regime starting around Period 16. Over the last 6 periods (16-21), the average demand is approximately 118.8 units (133, 95, 95, 166, 115, 109), whereas the prior average was approximately 81 units. This represents a ~47% increase. To ensure the OR backend reacts to this sustained shift, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival messages (Period 17 order arrived in Period 21), so L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed history. Current on-hand inventory is low (29) due to the demand spike, but there are 570 units in transit (orders from P18, P19, P20, P21), which should normalize the position as they arrive over the next 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1781.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrival in Period 22 from an order placed in Period 18). Demand analysis shows a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand from Period 1 to 15 was approximately 81 units, whereas the average demand from Period 16 to 22 has increased to approximately 115.7 units. The last two periods show a slight stabilization but remain higher than the initial baseline (Period 21: 109, Period 22: 97). Given this sustained increase, I will use a recent N=7 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures this updated demand profile starting from Period 16. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as historical data consistently confirms the 4-period lead time. This will ensure the base stock levels are high enough to prevent the stockouts observed in Periods 17, 19, and 20, while the backend's capping mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed sustained since Period 16: average demand increased from ~81 to ~116 (+43%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1567.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last 8 periods (Period 16-23), the average demand is 112 units per period (compared to ~80 previously), despite some volatility. I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining stability. The lead time (L) has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 21, 22, and 23), so I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize these historical observations. On-hand inventory is currently 67, and there are 522 units in transit, which should sufficiently cover the lead time pipeline, but the elevated mu_hat ensures the base stock stays ahead of the higher demand level.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a sustained regime shift starting around Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 24 is approximately 118, compared to an earlier average of approximately 81. Recent volatility is also notably higher, with values ranging from 86 to 169. Period 24 demand was particularly high at 169. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 77 and significant pipeline inventory (411 units), the priority is maintaining the service level given the higher demand regime while avoiding excessive holding costs. I will use the last 9 periods (Period 16-24) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current higher-demand environment. L=4 remains the appropriate lead-time estimate.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant sustained increase starting around Period 16. Comparing the first 15 periods (mean ~80) to the last 10 periods (mean ~116), there is a clear upward shift with high volatility (spikes up to 169 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by recent arrivals (P20 and P21 orders arrived exactly in P24 and P25). To handle the current demand regime, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean (~116) and increased variance observed over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). Given the higher profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate for this higher-demand phase to avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime sustained at higher level: P16-P25 average demand is ~116 units compared to the pre-P16 average of ~81 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3185.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained at a higher level since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26 (11 samples), the average is approximately 127.3 units per period. The most recent five periods (P22-P26) show an even higher average of 137.4 units. Given this trend, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the full scope of this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed arrivals (P22 order arrived in P26). On-hand inventory is critically low (7 units) while in-transit inventory is high (494 units). Using the recent_N method ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand state while the OR backend's capped policy prevents excessive over-ordering by accounting for the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime sustained at a high level: Period 16-26 average demand is 127.3 units compared to the pre-P16 average of ~81 units (+57%). Recent 5-period average (P22-P26) reached 137.4 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1615.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P27) shows a significant increase to an average of ~126 units per period, compared to the pre-P16 average of ~81. Over the last 5 periods (P23-P27), the average is even higher at ~140 units. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and the Period 27 demand of 111 resulted in a stockout. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To avoid further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods (the higher regime since P16) to capture the trend, and sigma_hat using the same period to account for the increased volatility (std dev in this regime is approx 35). This ensures the base stock calculation (L+1 periods) reflects the current ~125-140 unit demand level rather than the historical average.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P16-P27): average demand is ~126 units (+55% vs early history). Volatility has also increased during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1292.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 28, the mean is approximately 122.3 units per period (1590 total demand / 13 periods). Recent volatility has also increased significantly, especially since Period 24, with demands of 169, 167, 168, 111, and 77. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and combined with missed sales in the last two periods, there is an urgent need to maintain a high base stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture this distinct high-demand regime (P16-P28), and 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2010.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is approximately 121.3 units, compared to the pre-P16 average of ~81. Over the most recent 10 periods (P20-P29), the average demand is 120.8, confirming a sustained high-demand level. Volatility has also increased during this high-demand phase. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods since the single lost shipment from Period 5. Based on this evidence, I am using N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific high-demand regime, and N=10 for lead time to ensure stability around the promised 4-period mark. The current on-hand inventory is 61, and we have a large pipeline of 568 units, so the parameters will help the OR backend manage order levels to prevent excessive overstocking while meeting the higher demand mean.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 15 periods (P16-P30) shows a sustained higher average demand of approximately 121.5 units, compared to the earlier baseline. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P26-P30) have maintained this level with an average of 113.8 units, though with high variability. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P25, P26, P27, P28, P29, P30 all arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). I will use N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand phase. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current market reality (+50% vs early history) to prevent stockouts, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio which favors higher service levels.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the recent 16 periods (P16-P31), the average demand is approximately 120.6 units (sum=1930 / 16), compared to the earlier average of ~81 units. The most recent 5-period average (P27-P31) is 104.2, but this includes Period 28 which had a low demand due to inventory stockouts affecting the 'sold' quantity vs 'demand' (though 'demand' is stated as 77). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the high-demand regime is sustained and shows higher volatility, I will use a N=16 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current state accurately while accounting for the increased volume. Current on-hand is 199 with 401 in-transit, which aligns with covering the lead time plus current period (L+1=5) at the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level since Period 16: avg approx 121 units (P16-P31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime since Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 32 is approximately 119.5 units, compared to the pre-regime average of approximately 81 units. The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) have shown an average demand of 102.6, suggesting the initial spike has slightly leveled off but remains significantly higher than the early periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally target a high service level. To capture this sustained higher demand while acknowledging the recent stabilization, I will use a N=17 (from P16 to P32) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to cover the current regime.

The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher level (average ~121 units) compared to the initial periods. Over the last 5 periods (P29-P33), the average demand is approximately 110 units, while the average since P16 is 121.2 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P29 arrived in P33). I will use recent_N with N=18 (P16 to P33) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects the sustained increase in both volume and volatility. The inventory position (On-hand: 186 + In-transit: 406 = 592) is being compared against a target covering the next 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 34 (19 samples), the average demand is approximately 119.5 units per period. Recent performance (last 5 periods, P30-P34) shows a slightly lower average of 106.6, suggesting the regime has stabilized around the 115-120 range. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (except for one lost shipment and early initialization). To optimize the base stock for the next (L+1) = 5 periods, I will use recent_N with N=19 for mu_hat to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness. Sigma_hat is also set with N=19 to account for the increased volatility seen in this new regime. On-hand plus in-transit inventory (196 + 418 = 614) is being managed by the OR engine against these parameters to maintain service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 116.4 units per period, compared to the early history average of ~81 units. While there was a peak in demand between Periods 24-27 (avg ~154), the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35) have stabilized to an average of 107.6 units. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher demand regime that started at Period 16, while allowing the OR backend to account for the increased volatility observed in this segment. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 31-35), so I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize these observed lead times.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 36, the average demand is approximately 115.3 units per period, which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~81 units. The most recent 5 periods (P32-P36) show an average of 107.4, while the 10-periods (P27-P36) show 115.3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=21 (covering the entire new regime from P16-P36) for mu_hat to capture this sustained level without overreacting to minor recent dips. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=21 to reflect the current regime's volatility. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, which is the promised value; therefore, I will use the 'default' method for L. The inventory position (On-hand: 174 + In-transit: 405 = 579) currently covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the 115-unit rate, which is appropriate for a 4-period lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 22 periods (P16-P37), the average demand is approximately 114 units, which is significantly higher than the initial periods' average of ~81. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the average demand is slightly lower at 108 units, but shows consistent behavior with moderate volatility. Lead times have been highly stable at exactly 4 periods since the start (excluding one lost shipment in P9). I will use the recent_N method with N=22 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained high-demand regime while filtering out the early low-demand phase. For lead time, I will use the 'calculate' method as the 4-period lead time is consistently observed.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shifted around Period 16 and has stabilized into a higher-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16 to 38), the mean demand is approximately 114 units per period. The average of the last 10 periods (Periods 29-38) is slightly lower at 109 units, while the peak during this regime was around 125. The lead time has remained very consistent at 4 periods since the single lost shipment anomaly at Period 9. With on-hand inventory at 166 and in-transit at 405 (orders from P35-P38), the total pipeline covers nearly 5 periods of forecasted demand. However, to maintain the targeted service level (profit $19 vs. holding $1) and accommodate the sustained higher demand mean, I will use a recent_N window (N=23) that matches the current regime length to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses data reflective of the current market state without the influence of the lower-demand early history (pre-P16).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, higher-level regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Period 16 to Period 39), the average demand is approximately 114.7 units with a standard deviation of about 26.6 units. The most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) show a slightly lower mean of 101.2 units, but this includes a low outlier of 77 in Period 39. Given the consistent history since P16, I will use a window of N=24 (P16-P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory levels (On-hand: 171, In-transit: 434) are healthy, covering expected demand over the next 5 periods (1+L).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher level than the early history. Over the last 15 periods (P26-P40), the average demand is approximately 107.4 units per period, with a standard deviation of 22.8. In the more recent 10 periods (P31-P40), the average is 104.8. Given the critical service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, the OR engine needs accurate mu and sigma to prevent stockouts while maintaining manageable holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out the much lower early-game data. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased mean and volatility observed since Period 16.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a higher mean since Period 16. However, looking at the most recent history from Period 32 to Period 41, the average demand is approximately 101.3 units, which is lower than the peak period (P16-P31 avg ~121). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P37-P41) show an average demand of 93.6. This suggests a slight cooling or stabilization at a level between the initial low and the previous high regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P37 order arrived in P41). On-hand inventory is healthy at 222 units, and pipeline inventory is 356 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most relevant demand mean (101.3) and variance for the current period, balancing the higher historical regime with the recent moderation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Period 32-41 average demand is 101.3 units, compared to the Period 16-31 average of ~121 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift towards lower stability compared to the peak observed around Period 27. Specifically, the average demand from Period 32 to Period 42 is approximately 99 units, a drop from the ~121 average observed between Periods 16-31. Most recently, the demand in Periods 39-42 has been even lower (77, 93, 83, 66), averaging 79.75 units. This suggests the demand regime mentioned in the Period 42 Carry-over insight is continuing or potentially trending lower. Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand + in-transit = 512), while the desired base stock for 5 periods (L+1) at a projected mean of ~80-100 units suggests a target range of 400-500. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a high service level (~95%), I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (Period 32-42) to capture the current lower but stable regime (avg ~99). Lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1417.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 32-43) has transitioned into a more stable regime with a mean of approximately 96.5 units, down from the previous high-demand regime (~121 units). Specifically, the last 4 periods average ~76 units, indicating a potential deceleration. On-hand inventory is healthy at 274 units, which covers about 2.8 periods of recent mean demand. Pipelines include orders from Period 40 (71), 41 (78), and 43 (42), for a total of 191 units. Lead time is stably at 4 periods. Given the cooling demand, I will use a recent 12-period window (P32-P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the shift toward more moderate consumption (avg ~96), preventing excessive stock accumulation while maintaining high service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a lower level: Period 32-43 average demand is 96.5 units, significantly lower than the P16-P31 average of ~121 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 32. The average demand from Period 32 to Period 44 is approximately 98.2 units (N=13), which is a significant drop from the high-demand regime observed between Periods 16-31 (~121 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 230 units, and in-transit inventory is 203 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With the current mean around 98.2, the total requirement for (L+1) periods is approximately 491 units. Since 'on-hand + in-transit' is 433 units, the system will naturally order to bridge this gap while the cap prevents over-ordering. I will use recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime accurately. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1152.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level recently. Since Period 32, the average demand has been approximately 97 units. Specifically, from Period 41 to 45, demand values were 83, 66, 89, 115, and 73, averaging 85.2. This is a significant decrease from the P16-P31 peak of ~121. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat (covering the period from P32 onwards) to capture this lower stable mean while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=14 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent 'conclude' messages (P41, P40, P39, P38). Inventory levels are healthy (On-hand: 235, In-transit: 247), which comfortably covers the lead time demand, allowing the OR backend to optimize the order size downward to minimize holding costs given the lower demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level since Period 32: Period 32-45 average demand is approximately 98 units (+21% vs pre-P16, but -19% vs P16-P31 peak).

chips(Regular): ordered=67, arrived=0, starting on-hand inventory=235, demand=114, sold=114, ending on-hand inventory=121

Daily Reward (R_t): $2045.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting around Period 32. While the period 16-31 peak averaged ~121 units, the average from Period 32 to 46 has stabilized significantly lower, at approximately 98.4 units. Most recently (P42-P46), demand has averaged 91.4 units. I will use N=15 for mu_hat to capture this lower 'post-peak' regime which began at P32. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by multiple arrivals including P41 arriving at P45). The arrived=0 in Period 46 is consistent with the order of 0 units placed in Period 42. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 121, but pipeline inventory should be maintained to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1517.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 32. The average demand from Period 32 to Period 47 is approximately 97.4 units, compared to the peak average of ~121 units observed between Periods 16-31. Most recently, the 5-period average (P43-P47) is ~95 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). Note that the order from Period 42 was 0, explaining the 'arrived=0' in Period 46. I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat starting from the stabilization point at Period 32 (N=16) to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining enough data for stable standard deviation. L is set to calculated as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods since early in the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2038.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 32. Analyzing the last 17 periods (P32-P48), the average demand is approximately 98.4 units. More recently (P44-P48), the mean is 99.2. Therefore, I will use a recent_N of 17 to capture this stabilized regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the Period 42 order (0 units) being the only anomaly, though the Period 43 order arrived on time in Period 47. We are currently at Period 49, heading into the final period of the game (Period 50). With 52 units on-hand and 387 in-transit, we need to ensure we don't over-order in this final phase while maintaining a service level based on the current regime's mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1726.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 32, with an average demand of approximately 96 units over the last 18 periods (P32-P49). The very recent demand (last 5 periods) is roughly 99 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, although a temporary disruption was noted previously (Period 42 order was 0, resulting in no delivery in Period 46). On-hand inventory is 79 units with 378 units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 to capture the current stable regime since Period 32. Sigma_hat will also use N=18 to reflect the variance of this specific demand environment. L is set to calculated as the behavior is consistently 4 periods.
