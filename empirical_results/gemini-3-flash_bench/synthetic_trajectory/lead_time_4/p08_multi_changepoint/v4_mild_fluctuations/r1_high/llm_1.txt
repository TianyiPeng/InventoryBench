The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive in Period 5 (1+4=5) and be visible in Period 6. To cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (Periods 1 through 5), I need to account for approximately 5 periods of demand. Using the historical mean (85.8), the expected demand over 5 periods is ~429 units. Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I must order enough to cover this window. Given the variance and the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a slightly higher safety stock is justified. I will target a total pipeline inventory of 475 to account for the increasing trend seen in the historical Period 5 data (126).",

Historical demand for chips (Regular) shows a mean of approximately 86 units (84, 55, 79, 85, 126 over the first 5 samples) with a potential upward trend or high variance (Period 5 reached 126). My goal is to maintain a pipeline that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Total projected demand for a 5-period window is roughly 430-500 units. Currently, there are 475 units in transit (ordered in Period 1). Since I have no on-hand stock and actual lead time is likely 4, I will not see fresh stock until Period 5. I will place an order of 100 units now to start a rolling pipeline that accounts for future demand cycles, as the 475 units already in transit will likely be depleted quickly once they arrive given the accumulation of missed demand and ongoing consumption.",

In-transit is 575 (475 from P1 + 100 from P2). Total pipeline (0 on-hand + 575 in-transit) must cover demand for L+1 periods (P3, P4, P5, P6, P7).

Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units (recent periods 40-44 average ~89, but the long-term stable mean since P30 is ~105). Currently, there are 161 units on-hand and 370 units in-transit. The in-transit breakdown based on the 4-period lead time is: Period 41 order (100) arrives in P46, Period 42 order (100) arrives in P47, Period 43 order (120) arrives in P48, and Period 44 order (50) arrives in P49. Total available inventory for the remaining 6 periods (P45-P50) is 161 (on-hand) + 370 (in-transit) = 531 units. Expected total demand for P45-P50 using the ~105 mean is 630 units. To satisfy this demand and minimize the risk of stockouts in the final period, I need approximately 630 - 531 = 99 units. I will order 100 units to cover this gap and maximize total profit.",

With a lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 50. Total sales are resolved at the end of Period 50, after which the game ends.

In the final period, the objective is to maximize profit and satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs, as inventory left at the end of Period 50 yields no future value. On-hand inventory is currently 155 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 50) would only arrive in Period 54, which is beyond the game's duration. Therefore, no further units should be ordered.
