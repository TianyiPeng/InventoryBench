Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0, and there is no historical lead-time data yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85, which averages 97.2 per period. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Since there is no 'conclude' message yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters based on the 5 available samples to establish a baseline forecast. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and order enough to satisfy demand over the lead time plus current period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 126 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. This order is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The demand in Period 1 was 156, but since starting inventory was 0, zero units were sold. Historical demand samples (n=5) show a mean of 97.4 and a standard deviation of 16.9. Since there are only 5 historical samples and no completed lead time observations yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data. This approach estimates demand and volatility based on the full sample set until more specific lead-time or demand-shift data is observed in the conclude messages.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), demand has been observed for two periods (156, 117), but we have had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (126 units) are expected to arrive in P5, and P2 orders (155 units) in P6. Consequently, 'In-transit' is 281. Since no orders have concluded yet, we cannot infer a change in the actual lead time, so we stick to the default L=4. For demand estimation, we have very limited data (n=5 historical + 2 periods), and demand seems relatively stable around the mean of 115. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while we wait for inventory to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 441 units) are in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 (for the P1 order) at the earliest, per the leads definition (N+L arrival). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected given the lead time. Demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows 156, 117, 90 across the first three periods, with additional historical data providing 110, 116, 74, 101, 85. The average demand across all available samples (including the concluded game history) is approximately 106 units per period. Since there are no observed lead times yet to contradict the promised 4 periods, I will use the default lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent fluctuations while maintaining a stable base for the OR backend to calculate the inventory position (covering L+1 = 5 periods of demand).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5's arrival resolution phase (the current period). Thus, no 'conclude' messages show arrivals yet, which is expected behavior for L=4. In-transit inventory (598 units) correctly reflects orders from P1-P4 (126+155+160+157). On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals haven't occurred yet. Demand across P1-P4 has been consistently missed (sold=0) due to lead time. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the start of P5) is: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85. Average demand is ~97.2 units per period. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available history since the demand appears relatively stable without any confirmed seasonal or regime shifts yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1754.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the first order from Period 1 arrived exactly as expected in the Period 5 conclude message (lead_time = 4). No orders are currently delayed or lost. Demand history (110, 116, 74, 101, 85 from seeds and 156, 117, 90, 77, 94 from game history) shows some volatility but no clear sustained regime shift. The current in-transit inventory is high (483 units) because orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all still in the pipeline. With a lead time of 4, the target window is L+1 = 5 periods. The average demand across all available data (10 samples) is ~102. Including the first arrival, we have 32 units on hand. To maintain stock for the lead time duration, the OR backend needs parameters that reflect the confirmed lead time and the consistent but variable demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent patterns while acknowledging the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1933.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: the P1 order arrived in P5 (L=4) and the P2 order arrived in P6 (L=4). Therefore, we expect the P3 order (160 units) to arrive in Period 7 and the P4 order (157 units) in Period 8. Current on-hand is 81. Historical demand for periods 1-6 are [156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106]. There was an initial high demand (156) which has stabilized. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 96.8, and the shift from P1 to later periods suggests a more stable regime. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this stability while smoothing out the initial spike. For L, I will use 'calculate' since the evidence consistently points to the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 focuses on the current demand environment (approx 97 units/period) while accounting for necessary safety stock across the (L+1)=5 period risk horizon.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The history confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods (orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived in P5, P6, and P7 respectively). In-transit inventory (302 units) comprises orders from P4 (157), P5 (11), and P6 (134). These are expected to arrive in P8, P9, and P10. Demand has fluctuated between 74 and 156. The most recent three periods (P5-P7) show mean demand of 108.33, while the overall mean of all 7 periods is 109.28. There is no clear evidence of a significant regime shift yet, as demand stays within a stable range. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the updated volatility and mean after the initial stockout-affected periods. Since L=4 is confirmed and consistent with the promised lead time, I will use the 'default' method for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1007.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of the game history confirms that the actual lead time L is exactly 4 periods (as seen in successful arrivals for orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4), which matches the promised lead time. The demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility without a clear seasonal or structural trend in the first 8 periods (average demand \u2248 103.6). Inventory is currently healthy with 209 units on hand and 298 units in transit (orders from P5, P6, and P8). To calculate the base stock, I will use L=4 and set mu_hat based on the average of all available historical demand samples (N=8) to smooth out the noise observed in recent periods (ranging from 64 to 156). Sigma_hat will also be derived from the full sample set to capture total observed volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock for a high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1520.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8, and P5 arrived P9). Demand data for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 9 periods shows a mean of 102.8 units and a standard deviation of 27.9. There are no clear seasonal shifts or regime changes identified yet, as demand oscillates around the mean without a sustained trend. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand statistics since the start of the game. Calculating (1+L)*mean(102.8) results in a mu_hat around 514, which balances against the current pipeline (389 in-transit + 133 on-hand = 522). This approach ensures we maintain enough inventory for the lead time while avoiding excessive holding costs given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which naturally pushes the service level target higher.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2193.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by 6 consecutive arrivals (P5-P10). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability without strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality. Demand samples range from 64 to 156, with a average of approximately 104 units per period across all 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 144, and in-transit inventory is 345 (orders from P7 to P10). With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A base stock level targeting ~520 units (5 * 104) is appropriate. Since Pipeline Inventory = 144 (on-hand) + 345 (in-transit) = 489, the backend should order approximately 31 more units to reach target. Using 'default' for L and mu_hat/sigma_hat will utilize the full historical average, which is stable enough for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2356.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the order placed in Period 7 (0 units) concluded with an arrival of 0 units, which is consistent with the order quantity, but it confirms the lead time remains 4 periods. The on-hand inventory has dropped to 19 units following a demand of 125 in Period 11. Demand is roughly stable with a mean of ~106 units over the last 11 periods. However, recent demand (last 3 periods) has averaged ~111 units. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 453) consists of orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11 (153 + 102 + 90 + 108 = 453), which are expected to arrive in Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, I will stick with the default lead time. For demand, I'll use a slightly more recent window (N=11) to capture the trend since the start of the simulation while acknowledging the early zero-sales periods were due to stockouts, not zero demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 92 units with 450 units in transit. Reviewing the history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by the P8 order arriving in P12). However, a shipment placed in Period 7 (0 units) means nothing arrived in Period 11, which explains the dip in inventory. The demand shows no significant recent regime shift, with a mean of approximately 103 units over the last 12 periods. The total pipeline covers 5 periods (L+1), which for a mean demand of ~103 requires a base stock around 515. Currently, on-hand + in-transit = 542, suggesting we are slightly above the base stock but consistent with safety stock levels. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand and sigma to capture current volatility while ignoring the initial noise of the first two periods where sales were lost due to lead-time delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2486.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 6 to Period 13 shows an average of approximately 105.5 units per period, with relatively consistent volatility. Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P12, and P13 (P11 had no arrival because P7 ordered 0 units). Currently, there is an 'In-transit' quantity of 372 units, which accounts for orders placed in P10 (90), P11 (108), P12 (150), and P13 (24). These are expected to arrive over the next four periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 60 units and the demand is steady, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand mean and standard deviation from the most recent stable regime (Periods 6-13). This balances the need for service level without over-adjusting for the minor fluctuations seen in the early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1770.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4. A missing shipment was observed in Period 11 (the order from Period 7 for 0 units was actually a zero-order, so 'arrived=0' is expected), meaning the supply chain remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 54 and in-transit is 430. Demand over the last 14 periods (including provided samples P1-P5) shows a stable regime: samples are 110, 116, 74, 101, 85, 156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125, 64, 87, 123, 125, 80, 134, 96. Calculating the mean of the last 10 periods (P5-P14) gives 103.4. Calculating the standard deviation over the same period gives approx 22.0. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect this current consumption rate and volatility, providing the OR backend with enough data to set a base stock that covers the 5-period lead-time-plus-review-cycle (L+1).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 92. In-transit inventory is 440, consisting of orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15. The shipment from Period 7 (0 units ordered) technically 'concluded' in the sense that no units arrived on Period 11 as expected, which explains the low on-hand inventory at Period 11 conclude. All other shipments from Periods 1-11 have arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering, confirming the promised lead time of 4 is stable. Demand over the last 15 periods has been relatively stable with no clear regime shifts or seasonal spikes identified in the 'Period_N' date markers. The mean demand is approximately 100 units. Since the lead time is stable at 4, L is set to default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=15 to capture the full history of the currently stable demand regime while allowing for slight fluctuations in the calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1518.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods and the observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P12 order arrived P16). Shipment for P7 (ordered 0) is logically 'arrived=0', and P11 arrived on schedule in P15. Demand history for chips(Regular) shows relatively stable consumption with a mean around 100-110 units. Recent samples (P6-P16) suggest a slight decrease or stabilization compared to the very early periods, with mean demand ~101 units. I will use N=11 (from Period 6 to 16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most stable recent demand regime. Service level target is high (~95%) because profit ($19) is much higher than holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as stable at 4 periods across 16 periods of data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2142.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 62 units, and there are 411 units in-transit. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods, as established in the carry-over insights and confirmed by the arrival of the Period 13 order in Period 17 (lead_time = 4). Demand over the last 17 periods has shown significant fluctuations but remains within a range of 64 to 156. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 116. Given the stability of the lead time at 4 periods, I will continue using the promised lead time (method: default). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the demand behavior since Period 6, which avoids the very high demand from Period 1 and focus on more recent levels. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers demand over L+1 (5) periods, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2830.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by historical data (all arrivals from P1 through P14 have arrived with a lead time of exactly 4). Demand over the last 18 periods has fluctuated but shows a relatively stable mean. Recent demand in Period 18 spiked to 152, but the average over the last 10 periods is approximately 106.7. Pipeline inventory is currently 383, consisting of orders from P15 (118), P16 (80), P17 (65), and P18 (120). The P15 order is expected to arrive during P19. With on-hand inventory at 58, the total position (58 + 383 = 441) is being managed against a lead time of 4 and next-period demand. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and variance to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average, as demand seems to have stabilized after the initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3344.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, demand spiked to 238, which is more than double the historical average, resulting in an out-of-stock situation (ending inventory 0). This suggests a possible demand regime shift or a significant seasonal peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity is 416, which covers orders from Period 16 (80), 17 (65), 18 (120), and 19 (151). To address the stockout and the sudden demand increase, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the recent volatility and the spike, while maintaining the L=4 based on historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 19 (238 units, +130% vs average). Monitoring to see if this is a sustained regime shift or a one-time event.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1520.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are out of stock (ending on-hand: 0) due to a massive demand spike in Period 19 (238 units) followed by insufficient arrivals in Period 20. The demand in Period 20 returned to a more normal level (94 units), suggesting the Period 19 spike was likely a transient one-time event rather than a sustained regime shift. However, following our stockout, we need to ensure we rebuild inventory to meet ongoing demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the Period 19 spike heavily skews the variance and mean, I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current demand environment while including the spike's influence, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat to prevent the OR engine from over-reacting to the single outlier in Period 19, which would otherwise result in excessive holding costs. The historical standard deviation excluding Period 19 is approx 27; with the spike it's much higher. I'll set sigma_hat based on the stable period volatility to maintain a high service level without excessive safety stock for a rare event.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand spike at Period 19 (238) confirmed as transient; Period 20 demand returned to 94 (near long-term average).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently recovering from stockouts triggered by a high demand spike in Period 19 (238 units). Although demand normalized in Period 20 (94) and Period 21 (136), leading to on-hand inventory hitting 0, we have significant in-transit inventory (639 units) scheduled to arrive. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The average demand across all 21 periods is approximately 113.8 units. Period 19's spike is treated as an outlier as confirmed in carry-over insights. To prevent over-ordering while ensuring recovery, I will use a recent_N window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the last 10 periods (Avg \u2248 121, including the spike) to provide slightly more buffer for recovery than the long-term average (Avg \u2248 114) without aggressively chasing the Period 19 outlier. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand inventory is 0 for the last four periods) due to a significant demand spike in Period 19 (238 units) followed by continued high demand in Periods 21 (136) and 22 (179). While Period 20 briefly returned to normal (94), the subsequent two periods suggest a possible regime shift or sustained high-volatility period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have been stocking out, we are losing sales and underestimating true demand (sold units < demand units in P19-P22). I will increase mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent trend of higher demands while addressing the stockout risk. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to account for the increased variance seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift suspected from Period 19: mean demand has increased from ~100 to ~150 (+50%) over the last 4 periods, resulting in a persistent stockout since Period 19.

=== Period 23 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $2489.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted since Period 19. While the long-term average (P1-P18) was 107.5, the average of the last 5 periods (P19-P23) is 155.8, a 45% increase. Although the Period 19 spike (238) was transient, the base demand has clearly stabilized at a higher level (94, 136, 179, 132). This shift caused stockouts from P19 to P22. We are currently back in stock with 19 units on-hand after a large arrival (151 units), but to avoid further stockouts and satisfy this higher demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat must be adjusted. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this new regime for both mean and volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by the 'conclude' messages (P19 order arrived P23).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 19: mean demand increased from ~108 to ~156 (+45%) based on last 5 periods (P19-P23).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 25. The data confirms a sustained lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since Period 19, there has been a significant demand regime shift. The average demand from Period 1 to 18 was approximately 107.7 units. From Period 19 to 24, the demand has been: 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131, averaging 151.6 (+41%). This shift caused persistent stockouts from Period 19 to 22. In Period 24, we received a large shipment (243 units) which restored our on-hand inventory to 131. To account for this new higher demand regime and its volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 49.5 for P19-P24 versus \u2248 25.3 for P1-18), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the behavior since Period 19. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the increased demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), while balancing the relatively high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift starting at Period 19. Previously, demand averaged around 108 units; however, from P19 to P25, the average has increased to approximately 147.8 units (238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131, 125). Although P19 was a massive spike, subsequent demand has remained consistently higher than the pre-P19 average, except for P20. The current on-hand inventory is 131 with 687 units in-transit. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through P25. To capture this new demand regime while smoothing out the extreme P19 outlier, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the period from the initial spike to the present, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the ~148 unit average demand across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~108 to ~148 (+37%) based on last 7 periods (P19-P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 19 is confirmed and stable. Analyzing the demand from Period 19 to Period 26: [238, 94, 136, 179, 132, 131, 125, 139]. The mean of these 8 observations is approximately 146.75, which is significantly higher (+36%) than the previous mean (~108). The inventory system has recovered from the stockout that occurred between P19-P22, with on-hand inventory now at 136. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P22 arrival in P26). I will use N=8 for 'recent_N' to capture the new regime's mean and variance precisely for the OR backend, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current demand profile while accounting for the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~147 (+36%) based on 8 periods of data (P19-P26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3033.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift starting at Period 19. Before Period 19, the average demand was approximately 108 units; since Period 19 (9 periods of data), the mean demand has risen to 149.2 units, a roughly 38% increase. Recent activity (Period 27 demand of 169) confirms this higher level is sustained. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving on schedule from Period 23. Current on-hand inventory is 178, and pipeline inventory is 547. To address the new demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to capture the higher mean (approximately 150 units/period). This covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). Sigma_hat is also set using the recent N=9 to account for the increased volatility seen during this high-demand phase. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (~95%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~108 to ~149 (+38%) over the last 9 periods (P19-P27).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 19. Initial long-term demand (P1-P18) averaged ~108 units, but since P19 (excluding the outlier of 238), it has stabilized at a higher level. Monitoring the last 10 periods (P19-P28), the mean demand is approximately 144.9 units (1449 total / 10 periods). The recent observation in Period 28 (106 units) is lower but still consistent with a high-variance environment around a shifted mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 312 and 481 in-transit (reflecting large orders from P25-P28), we are well-positioned to meet this higher demand regime. I will continue to use a recent_N window of 10 for mu_hat to capture this sustained higher demand level while budgeting for the established lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~145 (+34%) based on 10 periods of data (P19-P28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2716.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that occurred at Period 19 is now well-established over 11 periods (P19-P29). The average demand in this new regime is approximately 146 units, compared to the pre-P19 average of approximately 104 units. Period 29 demand was 156, supporting this higher average. Lead times remain stable and consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 248 units, and with 473 units in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand levels. I will continue using recent_N (N=11) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current regime (P19 onwards). This ensures that mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased demand and variance observed since the shift, while the backend OR logic maintains the appropriate service level for a high-profit item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~104 to ~146 (+40%) based on 11 periods of data (P19-P29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3078.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 19. Previous analysis (up to Period 30) showed the mean demand increased from ~104 to ~146. Calculating the mean for the most recent 12 periods (P19-P30) specifically: (238+94+136+179+132+131+125+139+169+106+156+171) / 12 = 148.0. This confirms the stabilized higher demand level. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With L=4, the system must cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. The backend formula uses (1+L) * mean, so using recent_N=12 for mu_hat correctly captures this new average. sigma_hat is also updated using the same window to reflect the current volatility in this higher demand regime. On-hand inventory is healthy at 171, and in-transit is 533, which aligns with the lead-time pipeline expectations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~148 (+42% vs baseline) based on 12 periods of data (P19-P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2328.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 19 remains sustained. Over the 13-period window from Period 19 to Period 31, the average demand is approximately 146.5 units, compared to the pre-shift average of approximately 104 units. This represents a ~41% increase. Recent demand in Period 31 was 131 units, following 171 in Period 30. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 161 and a large in-transit pipeline of 589 units, the priority is to maintain parameters that cover the (L+1) window (5 periods) while accounting for the higher mean and volatility. I will use recent_N with N=13 (the length of the new regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current behavior effectively without being over-influenced by the lower historical demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand regime shift at Period 19 consolidated; mean demand ~147 (+41% vs baseline) based on 13 periods (P19-P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 19 remains stable. Analyzing demand from Period 19 to Period 32 (14 samples), the mean demand is approximately 147.1 units per period, a significant and sustained increase from the pre-P19 average of ~104. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 177 units, and in-transit inventory is 535 units. Given the transition and higher demand variance in this new regime, I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering the entire new regime P19-P32) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current demand distribution and volatility, while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4 periods to align with consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 stable: mean demand ~147 (+41% vs baseline) through Period 32 (14 samples).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2479.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 remains stable. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P19-P33), the mean demand is approximately 146.4 units per period, which is a significant increase from the pre-P19 average of ~104. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33. Current on-hand inventory is 124 units, and in-transit inventory is 608 units (covering orders from periods 30, 31, 32, and 33). These in-transit units are expected to arrive in Periods 34-37. To maintain the inventory position for the new demand level, I will continue using a recent window that captures this higher demand regime (N=15). This ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock using the updated mean and variance, effectively balancing the high service level required by the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 stable: mean demand ~146 (+40% vs baseline) based on 15 samples (P19-P33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2962.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 continues to be stable. Over the last 16 periods (P19-P34), the mean demand is approximately 147.2 units, compared to the pre-P19 average of approximately 104 units. The standard deviation during this new regime is approximately 34.6. Lead times remain consistent and stable at 4 periods. Since the shift is well-established (16 samples), I will continue using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 to capture this higher demand average and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current market reality, maintaining a high service level while managing holding costs for the 116 units currently on hand and the substantial pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 stable: mean demand ~147 (+41% vs baseline) through Period 34 (16 samples).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 remains stable. Analyzing the 17 periods from P19 to P35, the mean demand is approximately 146.5 units per period, compared to the pre-P19 average of ~104. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods, with the P31 order arriving exactly in P35. With 161 units on hand and 569 units in transit, the system has sufficient inventory to cover the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will continue using recent_N with N=17 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time is stable at the promised value of 4.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 appears to have slightly softened or stabilized. Initially, we observed a jump from ~108 to ~156, but recent periods (P34-P36) show values of 162, 132, 121. The mean of the 18 samples from P19 to P36 is approximately 146.1. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P32 order arriving in P36). With on-hand inventory at 160 and in-transit at 574, we are well-positioned. Using N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entirety of this current higher-demand regime while excluding the previous lower-demand baseline. This will provide the OR engine with a stable forecast for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 stable: mean demand ~146 units across 18 samples (P19-P36), representing a ~40% increase over the initial baseline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 is well-established, with mean demand stabilizing around 146-147 units over the last 19 periods (P19-P37). Most recently, demand in Period 37 was 156 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order exactly 4 periods later. Pipeline inventory is currently 529 units (orders from P34, P35, P36, P37), and on-hand inventory is 161. Since the regime is stable, I will continue using N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full character of this higher-demand period (P19-P37). This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean and volatility while the backend's OR logic manages the replenishment against the pipeline.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 19. Before Period 19, mean demand was approximately 104 units; since Period 19, the mean has stabilized at approximately 146.5 units based on 20 samples (P19-P38). The most recent demand (Period 38) was 147 units, right at this new average. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P30-P34. To ensure the OR backend captures this higher demand regime specifically while ignoring the lower historical baseline, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=20 (covering the period from the shift to the present). For L, I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize the observed stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=20 to capture the volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 stable: mean demand ~147 units across 20 samples (P19-P38), representing a ~41% increase over the initial baseline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new high-demand regime since Period 19. The mean demand from Period 19 to Period 39 is approximately 149 units per period (calculation: 3122 total units / 21 periods), a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~104. Lead time remains stable and consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 121 and in-transit at 537, the total pipeline is 658 units. To ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) window, I will use recent_N with N=21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the localized statistics of this current regime. This reflects the sustained mean of ~149 while maintaining the necessary buffer for volatility observed in this period range.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 19, increasing from an average of ~104 to ~147 per period. For Period 41, the last 22 samples (P19-P40) yield a mean of 147.2. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by consistent arrivals from P1 through P36 orders. Current on-hand inventory is 92, with 608 units in transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). To accommodate the sustained higher demand mean and variance observed since P19, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods using the 'default' method, and mu_hat/sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=22 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime while excluding the lower-demand baseline from early periods. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) based on current market behavior.

The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 remains stable.

Recent demand in Period 41 was slightly lower (119), but given the historical variance and the established shift, this is not yet evidence of a new regime. Lead times remain consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 85, with a healthy pipeline of 648 units. I will continue using N=23 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~146 mean demand level and its associated volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 19, with a mean demand of approximately 147 units and a standard deviation of 29 units. The most recent period (P42) saw a high demand of 190. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is currently high (605 units in-transit). Given the shift at P19, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 (covering Periods 19-42) to capture the current regime more accurately for the backend OR engine. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased mean and volatility observed since the shift, while the high in-transit volume will naturally scale back the immediate order size.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 remains stable. Analyzing the demand from Period 19 to Period 43 (25 samples), the mean is approximately 144.9 units. The most recent demand (P43=116, P42=190, P41=119) shows continued volatility around this mean. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P39 order arrived P43). Given the current on-hand inventory of 79 and a high pipeline (661), the OR backend needs to maintain the base stock level reflective of this higher demand regime to avoid stockouts, while considering the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime since P19, providing a stable estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 remains the dominant pattern, with demand stabilizing around a mean of ~147 units. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is 144.2 units, confirming the carry-over insights of a sustained higher level compared to the initial baseline (~104). Lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods, with the arrival in Period 44 (ordered Period 40) perfectly matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 151 units on-hand and 538 in-transit (covering orders from P41, P42, P43, and P44). To maintain this stability and account for the observed demand level, I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat (covering the entire current regime since P19) and recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to capture the variance of this regime. Lead time remains at the default (promised) value of 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a higher mean of approximately 147 units since the regime shift at Period 19. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 147.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation, it is critical to maintain service levels without overstocking at the end. I am using recent_N=27 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire post-regime-shift period (P19-P45) to ensure a robust forecast of the current demand level. The on-hand inventory is 133 and in-transit is 542, totaling 675 units, which is slightly less than the expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (base stock approximately 147 * 5 = 735), justifying continued ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift at Period 19 is well-established, with the mean demand stabilizing around 146-150 units. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the average demand has been approximately 147.8 units, confirming the persistence of this higher demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 74, with 603 units in transit (comprising orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). Since the game is nearing its end (Period 47 of 50), I need to maintain sufficient stock to cover the remaining periods while being mindful of the 4-period lead time. An order placed now (P47) will arrive in P51, which is outside the 50-period horizon. Therefore, the parameters should focus on managing the inventory already in the pipeline and on-hand. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current demand regime (P27-P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher mean and associated volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the simulation (Period 48 of 50). The demand regime has been stable since Period 19, with a mean of approximately 147 units. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P43-P47) has averaged 148.2 units, confirming this stability. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 115, and in-transit inventory is 560 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current Period 48, orders placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is beyond the game's end at Period 50. Therefore, our primary goal is to manage existing stock and in-transit units to cover demand for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). However, the OR backend requires parameters to function. I will use 'recent_N' with N=29 to cover the entire stable regime since Period 19 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L. The pipeline inventory (560) + on-hand (115) = 675, which is more than enough to cover the expected demand of ~441 (3 * 147) for the remainder of the simulation without risking excessive holding costs from new orders that won't arrive in time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2652.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 19, increasing from a baseline of ~108 to a stabilized mean of approximately 147 units. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the mean demand is 143.1 units, while the mean since P19 (30 samples) is 146.7. Standard deviation since the shift is approximately 28. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P44 order arrived P48). I will set L to 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=30 to fully capture the post-shift regime behavior while filtering out the pre-shift low-demand period. Pipeline inventory is currently 664 units, and on-hand is 46.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3118.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 19 remains stable. Mean demand from Period 19 to Period 49 (31 samples) is approximately 149.5 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~104 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the shift is well-established and stable over more than 30 periods, I will use recent_N with N=31 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current 150-unit average while accounting for the observed volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 stable: mean demand ~150 units across 31 samples (P19-P49), confirming a structural increase of ~44% over the initial baseline.
