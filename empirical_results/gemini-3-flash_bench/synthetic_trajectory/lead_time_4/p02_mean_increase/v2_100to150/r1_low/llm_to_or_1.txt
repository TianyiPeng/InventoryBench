Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance yet. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. The provided demand history for Periods 1-5 shows an average demand of approximately 97.2 units (110, 116, 74, 101, 85). Since we are currently making the decision for Period 1, we must forecast demand to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using the 'default' method for L takes the promised value of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, 'default' uses the available global stats. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which is appropriate for a balanced regular SKU like this before specific trends emerge.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 126 units based on the initial demand samples (average ~97), but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 as demand (139) exceeded on-hand stock. The historical demand data (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) averages 97.2, but the most recent realized demand in P1 was 139, which is significantly higher than the average. This could indicate a higher baseline demand or initial volatility. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (L+1 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 (using the provided historical samples) to stabilize the forecast while accounting for the recent variability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the standard deviation of the last 5 samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Orders were placed in Period 1 (126 units) and Period 2 (146 units), totaling 272 units in-transit. No arrivals are expected yet according to the promised lead time (P1 order should arrive in P5 resolution, visible in P6). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts for P1 and P2 (demand 139 and 114 respectively). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including samples provided) is 110, 116, 74, 101, 85, with an average of 97.2. However, the game history for P1 and P2 shows demand of 139 and 114. Using the available history (110, 116, 74, 101, 85, 139, 114), the mean is approximately 105.6. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture all available data points (5 samples + 2 concluded game periods) to stabilize the forecast, and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as we have no evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time or total history volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4 means arrival occurs during Period N+L, and becomes visible in Period N+L+1). Consequently, all demand encountered so far (Periods 1-3) has resulted in lost sales because on-hand inventory remains 0. Currently, 413 units (orders from P1, P2, and P3) are in transit. Historical demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~123 units (139, 114, 117). Using N=3 for demand parameters as it covers the observed history. Since no orders have reached the arrival phase yet, there is no evidence to override the promised lead time of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The total in-transit quantity is 559 (sum of orders from P1-P4: 126+146+141+146). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is scheduled to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have been 0 for the first 4 periods due to lead-time delay. Historical demand samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) show an average of 97.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. There is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or lost shipments as the first order is not yet due to have 'concluded'. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available history and the promised lead time of 4, as the demand appears relatively stable without a clear regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 24 units. Total in-transit is 433 units (orders from P2, P3, and P4). No order was placed in P5 because the backend's default logic likely saw the large pipeline vs. on-hand. Historical demand over the first 5 periods is: 139, 114, 117, 112, 102. Mean demand is approximately 117. Standard deviation is approximately 13.5. Since L=4, the planning horizon is L+1=5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~585 units. Current inventory + In-transit = 24 + 433 = 457 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the slight downward trend in recent periods while maintaining a stable base for the lead time horizon. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promise.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2's order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). This confirms the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. Demand for the last 6 periods has been: 139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102. The mean demand is approximately 114.3. Given the high parity between profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (the median). To cover demand during lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5), I will use the mean of the last 6 observations. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most stable recent demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms that orders from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, Period 2 in Period 6, and Period 3 in Period 7, all with a lead time of exactly 4 periods. Current demand shows a slight downward trend over the last three periods (102, 102, 60), following an initial range of 112-139. However, the sample size for the 'lower' demand is small (3 periods). The mean demand over 7 periods is approximately 106.6. With L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory is 149 (on-hand) + 363 (in-transit: P4, P6, P7 orders) = 512 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should be the median (z=0) of the lead-time demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the overall mean while respecting the recent lower demand trend, and L='calculate' since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods consistently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-203.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5-8 (orders from Periods 1-4). Demand shows a clear downward trend: Period 1-6 average was ~114, while Period 7-8 dropped significantly to 60 and 46 respectively. Given this regime shift, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent lower demand more heavily while still keeping the model responsive (P6 demand was 102). Pipeline inventory is currently 238 (orders from P6, P7, P8), which plus on-hand 249 is 487 units. With lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current 5-period average is approx 420. Setting L=4 (default) as lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: Average demand decreased from ~114 (P1-6) to ~53 (P7-8) (-53%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular). The Carry-Over Insights and Game History indicate a significant demand shift. From Periods 1-6, demand averaged ~114 units. From Periods 7-9, demand has been erratic but generally lower, though Period 9 saw a jump back to 125. Calculating the average of the last 3 periods (P7-P9) gives (60+46+125)/3 = 77. This is higher than the previous estimate but still lower than the initial phase. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. We have 124 units on hand and 238 in-transit (P6 order of 127 arrived? No, P1-P4 arrived. P6-P8 orders totaled 127+90+21=238). Note that the P6 order (127 units) is due to arrive in Period 10's arrival phase (visible in Period 11). To adapt to the fluctuating demand while respecting the recent shift, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent context (avg 77). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility seen in Period 9 (standard deviation of 60, 46, 125 is ~42). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers (1+4) periods of demand while minimizing holding costs given high storage costs (holding=1.0, profit=1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recovery from the temporary mid-period dip (Periods 7-8). The demand in Period 9 (125) and Period 10 (113) aligned back with the initial demand levels (mean ~115). Since the temporary dip was not sustained, I am reverting the demand forecast to use a longer window to capture the stable mean of ~100-115. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6). Note that no order was placed in P5, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported for Period 9 (order P5 + 4 periods). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to include the initial high demand and the recent recovery, while acknowledging the dip. This helps the OR backend maintain a sensible base stock despite the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovered to original levels (~115) in Periods 9-10 after a brief 2-period dip; the previous 'regime shift' insight from Period 9 is now considered a temporary anomaly rather than a sustained shift.

In Period 12, we observe that the previous 'dip' in demand (Periods 7-8) was followed by recovery in Periods 9-10, but Period 11 saw another drop to 71 units. Given this volatility, using the full historical average (approx. 100 units/period) is more stable than reacting to individual fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7). We have 157 units on hand and 195 in transit (ordered in P8, P10, and P11). Total pipeline is 352 units. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the 'default' method which utilizes all samples (P1-11) to stabilize against the recent noise, as there is no clear sustained regime shift following the recovery in P9-10. This ensures we don't overreact to the P11 dip while maintaining a safety buffer for the base stock calculation.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current context shows that demand has stabilized following a temporary dip in Periods 7-8. Recent demand (Periods 9-12) has averaged 101 units, which is consistent with the long-term historical mean. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (P5 through P12 conclusions all show L=4). However, there is a potential missing shipment: the order from Period 5 (placed for 0 units) resulted in no arrival in Period 9, which is expected. The order from Period 6 arrived in Period 10, but the pipeline inventory is currently 315 units, indicating multiple pending orders (P9: 0, P10: 23, P11: 151, P12: 141). My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 (5) periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the post-initial-startup stability while smoothing over the Period 7-8 anomaly. For sigma_hat, N=10 will be used to better reflect the recent volatility which is slightly higher than the start but less extreme than the dip periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are stock-out (on-hand: 0) because nothing arrived in Period 13 (expected, as P9 had 0 order). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (observed in P10, P11, P12). Recent demand has fluctuated: P7-8 was a dip (~53), while P9-13 has averaged 100.2 units (125, 113, 71, 95, 97). Demand seems to have stabilized around 100 per period after the P7-P8 anomaly and the earlier P1-P6 levels (~114). I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5) to capture this current average. The pipeline inventory is high (389 units), consisting of orders from P10 (23), P11 (151), P12 (141), and P13 (74), which are scheduled to arrive in P14, P15, P16, and P17 respectively. Despite the current stock-out, the pipeline should cover the (L+1) window soon. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples to reflect the current post-dip demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-anomaly: Periods 9-13 mean is 100.2 units.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, with 478 units in transit. Demand has been volatile but shows a stable mean around 100 units recently (Periods 9-14 mean is ~94; full history mean is ~98). The most critical observation is that the order from Period 11 (151 units) is due to arrive this period (Period 15), meaning it will be available for next period's stock. Current in-transit includes orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14. Given the stockout in P13-14, we need to ensure the pipeline is sufficient. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the demand pattern since the 'anomaly' ended, providing a mu_hat that reflects the current ~100 unit/period demand across the lead time + review period (L+1=5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P14, P15) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. The demand history shows a period of volatility between P7-P14, but has recently stabilized. Excluding the Stockout periods where demand was not fully satisfied (P13, P14), the demand values are: P9(125), P10(113), P11(71), P12(95), and P15(103). The mean of these recent representative samples (N=5) is approximately 101.4. I will set L to 4 and use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the demand behavior since the recovery from the P7-P8 dip. The holding cost and profit are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% from the OR engine's perspective, though the capped policy will help prevent over-ordering.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 26, and in-transit inventory is 286 units. Historical data confirm the actual lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods. Since my decision in Period 17 covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I need to forecast total demand for this window. Recent demand has shown volatility: Period 16 saw a spike (163), following a lower demand in Period 14 (61) and a moderate one in Period 15 (103). The mean demand over the last 8 periods (Periods 9-16) is approximately 103.6 units, while the mean over the most recent 3 periods is 109 units. Given the recent spike, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current volatility while grounding the mu_hat estimation in a stable recent mean. This allows the backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current inventory position and the 5-period demand horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 16 (163 units), departing from the previous 5-period average of ~88 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 368 units in-transit. Recent demand has surged significantly in the last two periods (163 in P16 and 167 in P17), compared to a previous 5-period average of ~88. This represents a clear regime shift or a seasonal peak. The promised lead time remains 4 periods, which is consistently supported by the arrival history (P13 order arrived in P17). To capture this surge, I will use a short lookback window (recent_N=3) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this higher demand level (~144 average over P15-P17) and increased uncertainty. Setting L to 'calculate' leverages the stable history of 4-period delivery. This aggressive adjustment is intended to prevent further stockouts given the current inventory position of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg increased from ~88 to ~165 (+87.5%) over the last two periods (P16-17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Demand in the last three periods (P16: 163, P17: 167, P18: 186) averages 172 units, which is a nearly 100% increase from the prior Period 11-15 average of ~86. The Carry-over Insights already flagged this shift at Period 18. This high demand has resulted in zero ending inventory for the last two periods, despite arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 460 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new elevated mean (approx 172 units/period, or 860 units across a 5-period window). I'm also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from 86 to 172 (+100%) over the last 3 periods (P16-18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the demand environment remains in a high regime that began around Period 16. The average demand for the most recent four periods (P16-P19) is approximately 174.25 units (163, 167, 186, 181), confirming the shift noted in previous carry-over insights. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 653 units in-transit. Based on the consistent 'Period X conclude' messages, the actual lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods. The order placed in Period 15 was 0 units, which explains why 'Period 19 conclude' shows 0 arrivals. To cover demand over the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), and accounting for the OR backend's mechanics, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to reflect the current, slightly higher volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) is grounded in the current market reality of ~175 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high demand regime (P16-P19): Mean demand increased to 174.25 units, representing a sustained ~100% increase from the P9-P13 average.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 176.2 units, which is a substantial increase compared to the earlier baseline. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P17-P20) because the supply has not yet caught up to this new demand level. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. My goal is to set parameters that reflect this high-demand regime to allow the OR backend to place larger orders and rebuild the inventory buffer. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility period (P16-P20).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P20) average demand confirmed at 176.2 units (+100% vs P9-P13); high volatility (std dev ~10.4 during this period).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from an average of ~90 to ~167 units per period. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has been: 163, 167, 186, 181, 184, 137. This averages to 169.7 units. The drop to 137 in Period 21 is a slight cooling but still well above the pre-P16 levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P17 arrived P21). Current inventory is low (On-hand: 19), and we have high in-transit (725). The OR backend uses (1+L) periods for base stock. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures this new high-demand regime. For sigma_hat, N=6 also captures the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P21) average at 169.7 units; Period 21 saw a slight cooling (137) compared to the 180+ peak, but remains in the high tier.

The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16.

I will use N=7 to capture this regime accurately. The promised lead time L=4 is consistently observed in the history (most recently P18 order arrived on P22). With an on-hand inventory of 48 and in-transit inventory of 626 (orders from P19, P20, P21, P22), the pipeline is currently well-stocked to meet this higher demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to ensure the OR backend reacts to this sustained high-demand level while maintaining the standard lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P22) confirmed: mean demand 170.4 units, representing a ~70% increase compared to the P9-P13 average.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 persistent through Period 23, with current demand levels averaging approximately 172 units over the last 8 periods (P16-P23). Recent demand observations are 181, 184, 137, 175, and 175. This confirms that despite a one-period dip (137), the mean remains elevated. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (P19 arrived on P23). On-hand inventory is 66 with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 612 units, which reflects previous aggressive ordering to match the demand shift. To maintain the service level while avoiding excessive inventory buildup, I am using a recent regime length of N=8 (P16-P23) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current high-demand environment better than the total historical average.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P23) confirmed with mean demand of ~172 units (+72% vs. P9-P13 average).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean is approximately 172 units with a standard deviation of about 14.7. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (P20 order arrived P24). Consequently, I am setting L to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (covering the regime from P16-P24) to capture this sustained high mean (approx 172 * 5 = 860 for the 1+L window). For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current volatility appropriately. This approach ensures the inventory covers the pipeline and upcoming demand peaks given the high holding and profit costs are equal (critical ratio 0.5), targeting a base stock near the median demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P24) confirmed: mean demand remains stable at ~172 units (+72% vs. P9-P13 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 25 is approximately 172.4 units, representing a significant and sustained increase compared to earlier periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by recent arrivals (P21 order arrived in P25). Current inventory levels (On-hand: 38, In-transit: 634) are being managed based on this high regime. Given 10 periods of consistent high demand, I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific regime perfectly while excluding older, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is calculated against the most relevant mean (~172) and volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P25) stabilized: mean demand is 172.4 units, with lead time consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues, with the mean demand from Period 16 to Period 26 being approximately 170 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply slightly in Period 26. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 719 units, which includes orders from Periods 23 (179), 24 (177), 25 (173), and 26 (190). The order from Period 23 is expected to arrive this period (Period 27), as lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Since demand shifted significantly at Period 16, I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture this regime's mean and volatility while excluding the lower-demand history. Lead time L remains at the promised default of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips remains in the high-demand regime established around Period 16. The most recent demand (Period 27) was 199 units, slightly above the regime average of ~172. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27 (4-period lag). Currently, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 671 units in-transit (orders from Periods 24, 25, 26, and 27). To calculate the base stock requirements for the (L+1) period window (5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full scope of the high-demand regime from Period 16 onwards (Periods 16-27), providing 12 samples for mean and variance. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained 170+ demand level while accounting for recent volatility (std dev ~17.5 in this window). The OR engine will subtract the 671 pipeline units from the calculated base stock to determine the Period 28 order.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P27) consolidated: mean demand ~174.6 units (+75% vs. pre-P14 levels), with sustained higher volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 17.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P16-P28), the mean demand is approximately 172.5 units with a standard deviation of roughly 18.0. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P28 of the P24 order. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (14 units) following high demand in P27 and P28. The in-transit inventory (685 units) is substantial, covering nearly 4 periods of future demand at the current average rate. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use N=13 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for this sustained shift while ignoring the pre-P16 lower demand levels.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P28) stabilized: mean demand ~172.5 units with std dev ~18.0; Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high regime that started at Period 16. Analyzing the recent 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is approximately 173.6 units with a standard deviation of 18.2. Period 29 demand spiked to 200, resulting in zero ending inventory. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 671 (covering orders from periods 26, 27, 28, and 29), the cumulative pipeline is significant. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=14 to capture this sustained high demand period accurately while maintaining L at the stabilized value of 4. This configuration ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher volume and the consistent lead time observed in history.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 171.7 units with a standard deviation of about 19.3. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P23, P24, P25, and P26 conclude messages (arriving with L=4). Although demand in Period 30 was slightly lower (150), the overall trend remains high. I will set L to 4 and mu_hat based on the last 15 periods to calculate the base stock for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5). Setting sigma_hat to the standard deviation of the last 15 periods will appropriately account for the heightened volatility observed in this high-demand regime, ensuring a high service level given the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P30) mean demand 171.7, std dev 19.3. Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the window from Period 16 to Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 170.5 units with a standard deviation of 19.4. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history, with no evidence of lost shipments or significant drift. Current on-hand inventory is low (18 units) and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 689 units. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns the base stock closely with mean demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture this entire settled high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 4.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16.

Current on-hand inventory is 45 with 646 units in transit (covering orders from P29, P30, P31, and P32). I will use N=17 for both demand and volatility to capture this sustained regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed 4-period lead time. Parameters are designed to maintain a high service level (~90+%) given the equal profit and holding cost weights (q = 0.5 leads the OR to target the mean, but the cap and safety stock logic require robust sigma estimates).

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the recent 18 periods (P16-P33), the mean demand is approximately 166 units, though there has been a slight cooling in the last few periods (P30-P33 mean = 144). Period 33 demand was particularly low at 110 units, suggesting either a potential downward shift or high variance. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level (q=0.5), making the base stock equal to the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use recent_N=18 for mu_hat to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime while allowing the recent cooling to moderate the forecast. Sigma_hat will also use N=18 to capture the characteristic volatility of this regime. Current on-hand is 94, and in-transit is 649 (covering expected arrivals for P34-P37), meaning the system is well-positioned to handle transitions.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P33) average softened slightly to 166 units (down from ~172); Period 33 saw a local low of 110 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 166-172 units. Recent periods (P33 and P34) have shown a slight softening (110 and 142 units respectively), lowering the most recent regime mean slightly. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 149 and in-transit at 545, total pipeline inventory is 694. Given a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Based on the high-demand regime (starting P16, though including recent softer samples), I will use the mean and standard deviation from the last 19 periods (P16-P34) to capture the current regime characteristics while acknowledging the recent slight volatility. This period's inventory level is relatively healthy, so we maintain the standard policy calculations.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began at Period 16 (mean ~172) appears to have softened slightly starting around Period 33. The demand over the last three periods (P33-35) was 110, 142, and 149, averaging 133.7, which is significantly lower than the previous regime mean of ~170+. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture this gradual cooling while maintaining enough safety stock to prevent stockouts, as lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. The profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1) implies a 50% service level target, which typically results in base stock close to the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: mean demand decreased from ~172 (P16-P32) to ~134 (P33-P35) over the last 3 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear downward shift from the high-regime average of ~172 units (P16-P32) to a more moderate level over the last four periods (P33-P36: 110, 142, 149, 116), averaging approximately 129 units. This represents a ~25% decrease. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this more recent demand level using recent_N=4 to capture the softening while maintaining sufficient stock for potential variance. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Inventory levels are currently healthy (on-hand 174, in-transit 535), so a moderate base stock adjustment is appropriate to avoid overstocking while demand finds its new equilibrium.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~172 (P16-P32) to ~129 (P33-P36) over the last 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has confirmed a downward shift from the high-demand regime (P16-P32 avg ~172) to a more moderate level. Over the last five periods (P33-P37), demand values have been 110, 142, 149, 116, and 111, resulting in a recent mean of 125.6 units. This shift is significant and sustained enough to adjust parameters using N=5 for mu_hat. Volatility has also noticeably decreased alongside the mean, so I am using N=5 for sigma_hat to capture this lower variance and avoid over-ordering based on previous high-volatility regimes. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37 (lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is 225 with significant in-transit stock (373), which is sufficient to cover about 4.7 periods of current demand. Setting parameters to reflect the lower mean (125.6 * (1+4) = 628) and reduced volatility ensures the backend targets a lower base stock, preventing excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~172 (P16-P32) to 125.6 (P33-P37), a ~27% reduction.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has confirmed a downward shift starting around Period 33. The average demand decreased from ~172 (P16-P32) to approximately 125.6 (P33-P37), a ~27% reduction. The most recent demand (P38) was 143, which is slightly higher than the recent average but still significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as evidenced by consistent arrivals (P34 order arriving in P38). With on-hand inventory at 175 and 310 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 35, 36, and 38), the pipeline is sufficient. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (P33-P38) while allowing for the slight volatility seen in the latest period. This approach reduces the base stock to align with the lower demand, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $1 profit/$1 holding cost balance (target 50% cycle service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~172 (P16-P32) to 128.5 (P33-P38), a sustained ~25% reduction.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 33. The mean demand from Period 33 to Period 39 is approximately 127.3 units, a significant decrease from the previous average of ~172 units. In Period 39, demand was 156, showing some variability but staying within the established softened range. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 154 units, with 333 units in-transit (orders from P36, P38, P39). I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (P33-P39) precisely while ignoring the previous high-demand peak. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 33, entering a lower consumption phase compared to the peak seen in Periods 16-32. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 33 to Period 40 is approximately 137.5 units, which is a significant reduction from the previous ~172 units average. However, demand in the most recent periods (P39-P40) has rebounded slightly to 156 and 173 respectively. This suggests the 'softened' regime might be volatile or recovering. I will set N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime (P33-P40) while acknowledging the recent uptick. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P36 order arrived at P40). Our current position (on-hand 126 + in-transit 353 = 479) is relatively healthy against a forecast of ~137.5/period over a 5-period horizon (L+1), but we must maintain consistent ordering to avoid stockouts if demand continues to recover toward previous highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: avg demand decreased from ~172 (P16-P32) to ~137.5 (P33-P40), a ~20% reduction. Recent demand (P39-P40) shows a potential return to higher levels (>150).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, demand was 176 units, which is a strong confirmation of the 'return to higher levels' noted in the previous observation. The demand regime shift that began at Period 33 (softening to ~125.6-137.5) appears to have ended or reversed starting around Period 39. Over the last three periods (P39-P41), demand has been 156, 173, and 176, averaging 168.3 units. This is very close to the stable high-demand regime observed between P16 and P32 (~172 units). Therefore, I am resetting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recovery while maintaining responsiveness to recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P37 order is still in transit as expected, while P36 arrived on time in P40). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the transition from the dip back to high demand, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovered starting Period 39: Mean demand for P39-P41 is 168.3, returning to levels seen in the P16-P32 high-demand regime, effectively ending the P33-P38 dip.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has fully recovered to high levels after a temporary dip between Periods 33-38. The mean demand for the most recent four periods (P39-P42) is 175.5 (156, 173, 176, 197), consistently matching the previous high-demand regime of ~172. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, verified by the Period 38 order arriving in Period 42. Currently, there is an inventory shortage (0 on-hand) due to the low order volume placed during the temporary demand dip (e.g., Period 38 only ordered 30 units). However, there is a large pipeline of 679 units. To capture the current high-demand state while accounting for recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-recovery statistics.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery confirmed: Mean demand for P39-P42 is 175.5 units, returning to the high-demand levels observed in P16-P32.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has returned to high levels since Period 39. Over the last five periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged 174.2 units (156, 173, 176, 197, 169), which aligns with the high-demand regime observed between Periods 16-32. The brief dip in Periods 33-38 (mean ~125) is now treated as a completed anomaly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P39 order in P43. Currently, the system is facing a stockout with zero on-hand inventory, despite having 720 units in transit (representing orders from P40-P43). To recover and maintain service levels in this high-demand environment, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current recovery mean (~174) and sigma_hat using the same window to address recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime fully recovered: mean demand for P39-P43 is 174.2 units, consistent with the P16-P32 levels (~172).

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the high-demand regime, with the average demand for the last five periods (P40-P44) being approximately 169.6 units. This confirms the recovery noted in the Carry-Over Insights. However, Period 41 was a stockout, and Period 42-43 had very low starting on-hand inventory due to the 'zero' arrival in Period 41 (which corresponds to the 'zero' order placed in Period 37). Looking at the pipeline, we have orders from P41 (176), P42 (180), P43 (199), and P44 (151) currently in transit. The order from P41 is expected to arrive during the resolution of the current period (P45). To sustain this high-demand regime (avg ~174 in the recovered state) and account for recent volatility, I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (P39-P44) to capture the full recovery profile (mean ~167.3). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the high-demand regime identified in Periods 16-32. Since Period 39, demand has averaged 168.9 units (156, 173, 176, 197, 169, 133, 185), consistently higher than the Period 33-38 dip. The most recent demand (P45) was 185 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Inventory management is currently tight; we have 23 units on-hand and 629 in-transit. To ensure we capture the current high-demand phase (approx. 170 units/period) while accounting for volatility (std dev approx 20), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to reflect this recovery. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of high demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to and stabilized within the high-demand regime identified originally in Period 16, following a temporary dip between Periods 33-38. The mean demand from Period 39 to Period 46 is approximately 165.5 units (156, 173, 176, 197, 169, 133, 185, 135). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 42 order in Period 46. With the game ending at Period 50, the effective planning horizon is decreasing. Current on-hand inventory is 68, and in-transit is 647. Pipeline inventory needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat (capturing the stabilized recovery since Period 39) and a corresponding recent_N of 8 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (approx 23.4).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P39-P46) mean demand is 165.5, confirming full recovery from the P33-P38 dip to levels consistent with the long-term high regime.

Daily Profit: $181.00, Daily Holding Cost: $86.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in its high-demand regime, which recovered around Period 39. Over the last 9 periods (P39-P47), the average demand is approximately 167.2 units, with a standard deviation of about 21.6. Period 47 specifically saw demand of 181 units, consistent with this regime. The lead time is very stable at exactly 4 periods, with the P43 order arriving in P47 as expected. My current on-hand inventory is 86, and I have 561 units in-transit (P44-P47 orders). To maintain high service levels during this established high-demand phase (profit $1 vs holding $1 implies a 50% critical fractile, but the backend OR policy naturally handles the safety stock calculation), I will use the last 9 periods to parameterize the OR backend, reflecting the most recent sustained recovery and current volatility.

Daily Profit: $137.00, Daily Holding Cost: $100.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (starting Period 39) continues to be the dominant pattern, with a mean demand of approximately 165 units over the last 10 periods (P39-P48). Demand in Period 48 was 137, which remains well within the expected volatility (std dev ~20) for this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 100 units with 600 units in-transit (orders from P45, P46, P47, P48). Since we are in Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, the orders placed now will arrive in Period 53 (P49+4), which is outside the game's duration. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current state. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable high-demand regime (P39-P48) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 39, following a temporary dip. The mean demand over the last 11 periods (P39-P49) is approximately 166.7 units with a standard deviation of about 22 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P45 order in P49. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (10 units), while a significant amount is in-transit (622 units). Given that the backend base-stock calculation incorporates the (1+L) factor, I will use a recent_N approach with N=11 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime metrics. This ensures the OR backend balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% cycle service level) using the most relevant recent demand profile.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P39-P49) solidified: mean demand ~166.7 units, std dev ~22.3. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.
