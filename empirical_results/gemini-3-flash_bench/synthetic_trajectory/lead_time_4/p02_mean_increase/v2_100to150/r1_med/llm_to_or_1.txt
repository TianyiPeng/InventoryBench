Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) averages 97.2 units per period with a standard deviation of 16.7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory and the lead time is 4, we must place an order that covers demand for the next L+1 (5) periods. Using the mean (97.2 * 5 = 486) and standard deviation (16.7 * sqrt(5) = 37.3), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method to focus on the available sample set (N=5) and allow the OR engine to calculate the base stock to achieve the optimal service level (q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 126 units which are now in-transit. The demand in Period 1 was 139 units, but since there was no on-hand inventory, sales were 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 126 units in-transit. Given only one data point for demand (139) and the historical samples provided (110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the mean demand of the historical samples is approximately 97.2. Adding Period 1 demand (139), the updated mean is 104.16. Since we have very little evidence of a regime shift yet, I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' with N=6 (including Period 1) to capture the slightly higher recent demand in our mu and sigma calculations. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed Period 2, it is expected that arrivals from Period 1 (earliest order) have not yet occurred (expected arrival in Period 5 conclude, visible in Period 6 START). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 269 units in-transit (126 from P1 + 143 from P2). Demand for P1 and P2 was 139 and 114 respectively. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) show an average of 97.2 units per period. Since we are in the early stages and promised lead time is 4, I will use recent_N=3 for demand and sigma to capture the initial variance while maintaining the default lead time (4). Note that all demand so far has been lost due to zero stock, which is normal for the start of a simulation with L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced lost sales for Periods 1-3. Total in-transit is 427 (126 + 143 + 158). The historical demand for Periods 1-3 was 139, 114, and 117 respectively. Including the pre-game samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the mean demand across all 8 periods is approximately 107. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My parameters use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize all available historical data points for the initial steady-state forecast, as there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or demand regime shifts.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no shipments have arrived yet, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time. Total in-transit is 568 units (126 from P1 + 143 from P2 + 158 from P3 + 141 from P4). Historical demand over the first 4 periods is {139, 114, 117, 112}, with an average of approximately 120.5 units per period. Since there are no observed arrivals yet, I will use the default promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable demand observed so far and apply it to the (L+1) = 5 period window required by the OR engine. This ensures we maintain a base stock that covers demand until the next possible order arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed in Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 24 units, and we have 501 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 110, 116, 74, 101, 85 (average 97.2, std dev ~16.5). However, the demand observed within the 'conclude' messages (which might include a shift or variance due to timing) is 139, 114, 117, 112, 102. Averaging the 'conclude' demand samples (P1-P5) gives 116.8. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My goal is to maintain a base stock that accounts for this 5-period window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand cluster while acknowledging the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived end of P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory system has stabilized after the initial lead-time gap. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 65, and in-transit is 443 (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Historical demand samples are [139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102], averaging approximately 114.3. The trend shows a slight decline/stabilization around 102 in the last two periods. Since lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers these 5 periods of demand (~570 units) while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory. Given the stability of the demand and lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (all available samples post-initialization) and 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend use the confirmed historical average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is [110, 116, 74, 101, 85, 102, 102, 60]. Demand appears relatively stable but shows a slight downward trend and lower variance in the most recent periods (Periods 5-7). The established lead time is 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (all ordered 4 periods prior). Current on-hand is 163, and in-transit (pipeline) is 375 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), totaling 538 units which covers roughly 5 periods of average demand (~100 units/period). I will use L=4 (promised/confirmed). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent stable-to-slightly-lower demand (approx 512 for L+1=5 periods). For sigma_hat, N=5 will provide a conservative but realistic volatility estimate for the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-74.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Looking at historical arrivals, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Regarding demand, there is a clear downward shift starting around Period 7. Demand from P1-P6 averaged ~115 units, whereas P7 and P8 saw 60 and 46 units respectively. The average of all samples (P1-P8) is ~99 units. Given the recent drop, using the recent 3 samples (P6-P8) yields an average of ~69 units, which is a safer forecast to prevent overstocking given the current high on-hand inventory (258 units) and holding costs. I will set L to 4, mu_hat to reflect the recent lower demand regime (N=3), and sigma_hat similarly to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 7: average demand dropped from ~115 to ~53 units per period based on last two observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. A significant demand shift was previously noted starting Period 7, but Period 9 demand (125) represents a sharp rebound compared to Period 7 (60) and Period 8 (46). Averaging the last 3 periods (60, 46, 125) gives a mean of ~77, whereas the overall average is ~102. Given this volatility, I will use a larger N=5 for demand to stabilize the forecast against the recent spike while still acknowledging the overall downward trend from the start. On-hand + In-transit (192+175=367) is substantial, so I choose parameters that will likely result in small or zero orders to avoid excessive holding costs until the inventory levels normalize against the new demand reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand volatility increased; Period 9 spike (125) interrupts the low-demand regime seen in P7-P8. Need broader window to estimate stable mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Regular chips has shown significant variability recently. After an initial high average of ~115 (P1-P6), there was a brief drop to ~53 (P7-P8), followed by a return to high demand in P9 (125) and P10 (113). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 164 and 220 units currently in transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10), the total pipeline is 384 units. Given the recent resurgence in demand, I will refocus the forecast on the most recent 4 periods (P7-P10, mean ~86) to capture this rebound without being overly biased by the extremely high early numbers or the short-lived trough. Setting L to the confirmed value helps the backend calculate baseline targets, while using recent_N for both mean and sigma reflects the volatile regime transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: The low-demand phase (P7-P8) was temporary; P9-P10 confirm a return to a high-demand regime (avg ~119 for last two periods), invalidating the drop recorded in P9.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are dealing with high demand volatility but a stable lead time of 4 periods. Since the arrival confirms the promised lead time (orders from P1 through P7 have all arrived exactly in 4 periods), I am using 'default' for L. Demand analysis shows a possible shift: P1-P6 averaged ~115 units, P7-P8 dropped significantly (~53 units), and P9-P11 show a recovery with high variance (125, 113, 71). The mean of the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 83 units, while the mean of the last 3 (P9-P11) is 103 units. Given the carry-over insight that P9-P10 signal a return to high demand, I will use a window of N=5 (covering the drop and the recovery) to balance against overreacting to the P11 dip (71 units). Holding cost is $1 vs $4 profit, so the backend service level (80%) is appropriate given current inventory levels (183 on-hand + 250 in-transit).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the order from Period 8 (0 units) concluded. For the upcoming Period 13 decision, we are awaiting arrivals from orders placed in Periods 9 (0 units), 10 (130 units), 11 (120 units), and 12 (47 units). Total in-transit of 297 units correctly matches the pipeline. Demand has shown significant variance lately: P7=60, P8=46, P9=125, P10=113, P11=71, P12=95. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 85, while the earlier high-demand regime (P1-P6) averaged 114. Given this volatility and the absence of clear calendar cues, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture the current mixed-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by previous arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) after a stockout in Period 13 where demand (97) exceeded available inventory (88). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Inventory reconciliation: Orders from Period 8 (0 units), Period 9 (0 units), Period 10 (130 units), Period 11 (120 units), Period 12 (47 units), and Period 13 (99 units) are in-transit. The delivery from Period 8 (size 0) should have arrived during Period 12, explaining why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 12/13 concludes despite the 4-period lead time. An arrival of 130 units (from P10) is expected during Period 14 (visible in P15). Demand has been volatile: P7-P8 (~53), P9-P10 (~119), P11-P13 (~88). Currently, the demand seems to be stabilizing around a mean of ~100 units. Given the inventory gap (total pipeline is 396 units, which roughly covers 4 periods of demand at 100/period), I will use a recent window (N=5: Periods 9-13) to capture the current demand level of ~100 units per period. I will maintain L at the default (4) as the 4-period lead time remains consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~100 units/period (avg of P9-P13 is 100.2) following volatility in P7-P10.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 69 units with 400 units in-transit. Historically, lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P10 arrived in P14). I have identified a disruption in the arrival stream: orders from P8 and P9 (ordered in consecutive periods) have not arrived as of P14/P15, while the later P10 order arrived. This indicates that the P8/P9 orders are likely lost. The demand regime has stabilized around 100 units/period (average P9-P13 is 100.2, though P14 dipped to 61). To handle the inventory gap caused by lost shipments and maintain service levels, I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for demand to capture recent behavior (approx. 97 units/period) and stick to the promised lead time of 4. This will target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (approx. 485-500 units).

Carry-over insight: Shipment loss suspected: Orders from Period 8 and Period 9 have failed to arrive by Period 14, despite more recent Period 10 arriving on schedule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 16, we face a situation where shipments from Period 8 and Period 9 are definitively lost, as shipments from Period 10 and 11 have already arrived (both with a lead time of 4). This confirms the 'Shipment loss suspected' insight from Period 15. The inventory pipeline of 288 units consists of orders from Periods 12 (47), 13 (99), 14 (134), and 15 (8). Recent demand has stabilized: the last 5 periods (P11-P15) show an average demand of 85.4 units, though looking at the broader post-volatility window (P9-P15), the average is 95 units. To ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) window (5 periods), I will use the recent 7-period average (P9-P15) for demand forecasting to account for the stabilized yet occasionally fluctuating demand. I'll maintain L=4 as the established lead time.

Carry-over insight: Shipment losses confirmed: Orders from Periods 8 and 9 never arrived, while subsequent orders from P10 and P11 arrived with standard 4-period lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, our on-hand inventory is 0 following a demand spike of 163 in Period 16. Analyzing the pipeline, we have confirmed losses for orders placed in Period 8 and 9. Orders from Period 10, 11, and 12 arrived on time with a 4-period lead time. We are currently waiting on orders from Period 13 (arriving Period 17 resolution), Period 14 (arriving Period 18 resolution), Period 15 (arriving Period 19 resolution), and Period 16 (arriving Period 20 resolution). Total in-transit is 373 units. The demand regime has shown high volatility recently, with the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging ~104 units, but P16 alone was 163. I will use the recent 5-period average (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance and the higher demand floor. Since lead time appears stable at 4 periods despite the historical losses, I will use the calculated method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased specifically in Period 16 (163 units), requiring a more responsive sigma_hat to avoid stockouts during demand spikes.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 0 after stockouts in Periods 16 and 17. Demand has spiked significantly in the last two periods (163 in P16, 167 in P17), deviating from the previous average of ~100. This suggests a new high-demand regime or a seasonal peak. With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. The in-transit inventory is high (439), but since we are currently stocked out, we must ensure future orders account for this higher mean and volatility. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend (P14-P17) while discounting the older, lower demand periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite previous lost shipments in P8-P9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: demand surged from an average of ~100 to ~165 (+65%). High demand persists for 2 consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 163, 167, and 186, averaging approximately 172 units/period. This represents a significant shift from the previous average of ~100. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and have been losing sales. The inventory in-transit (513 units) includes large orders from P17 (165) and P18 (208), which are expected to arrive in P21 and P22 respectively, assuming the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. With L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods), mu_hat must reflect this new average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this sustained surge (172 * 5 = 860). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this spike, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~172) sustained for 3 periods (P16-P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is firmly established (Period 16-19), with an average demand of 174.25 units over the last 4 periods (163, 167, 186, 181). Previous shipments from P8 and P9 are confirmed losses, but the current lead time has stabilized back to the promised 4 periods (as seen in P14-P19 conclusions). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while there is a large pipeline (698), we have faced stockouts for four consecutive periods due to a surge in demand following a small order in Period 15. To recover and maintain a service level consistent with a $4 profit / $1 holding cost ratio (~80% critical ratio), I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new high-demand state (~174/period * 5 periods = 870). I'm using the standard 4-period lead time calculation. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility within this high-demand cluster.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~174) confirmed for 4 consecutive periods (P16-P19), a 74% increase over the previous ~100 avg.

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is confirmed and sustained. Demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) has been consistently elevated: 163, 167, 186, 181, 184 (average ~176.2). This represents a significant shift from the previous average of ~100. Despite regular arrivals with a 4-period lead time, we are currently experiencing stockouts (On-hand: 0) because the pipeline inventory ordered during the lower-demand period was insufficient. To recover and maintain service levels, mu_hat must reflect this new average. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this specific regime (176.2 * 5 = 881). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to capture the volatility within this high-demand block. Lead time L is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~176) now sustained for 5 consecutive periods (P16-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues, though Period 21 saw a slight dip to 137. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 169.6. We are currently experiencing significant stockouts because on-hand inventory is failing to meet these spikes, and we only just recovered to a non-zero ending inventory in Period 21. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is 80%, meaning we should prioritize meeting demand over minimizing holding costs. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime while including the recent dip to avoid over-ordering if demand is softening. Sigma_hat is also set to N=6 to reflect the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~170) sustained for 6 consecutive periods (P16-P21), despite a dip in P21 (137).

The demand regime has shifted to a significantly higher level starting at Period 16. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged 170.4 units, compared to the previous average of ~100. Although Period 21 saw a slight dip (137), Period 22 returned to 175, confirming the sustained high-demand state. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods for completed shipments (P10 through P18 have all arrived at L=4). I've used N=7 for mean and volatility estimates to fully capture this recent high-demand regime while excluding the previous lower-demand data. The stockouts observed between P16-P20 were primarily due to the suddenness of the regime shift and lead time lag, but inventory positions are now recovering as the larger orders placed during the shift begin to arrive.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~170) sustained for 7 consecutive periods (P16-P22).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is firmly established, with demand averaging approximately 172.5 units over the last 8 periods (P16-P23: 163, 167, 186, 181, 184, 137, 175, 175). Period 23 saw demand of 175, consistent with this trend. Lead times are stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P19 order arriving at the end of P23). Current on-hand inventory is 79, and the pipeline is substantial (631 units in-transit). To maintain the current regime without over-ordering as the OR backend's cap takes effect, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=8 for mu_hat correctly captures the current high-demand average (~172.5), which multiplied by (1+L=5) sets a base stock around 862. Given 79 on-hand + 631 in-transit = 710 pipeline, this targets an order of ~150 units, aligning with recent demand and preventing stockouts while accounting for holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~172.5) now sustained for 8 consecutive periods (P16-P23).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a clear high-demand regime beginning at Period 16. The average demand for the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is approximately 171 units per period, consistently higher than the previous period's average of ~100. Recent periods confirm this trend: P22 (175), P23 (175), and P24 (172). Lead times have consistently returned to the promised 4 periods following the confirmed losses of P8 and P9 shipments. The strategy remains focused on maintaining sufficient inventory to meet this high baseline while managing the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 16-20. I will continue using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime (P16 to P24 = 9 periods) and stick with the calculate method for L as lead times are currently stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~171) now sustained for 9 consecutive periods (P16-P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $678.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' continues, with demand averaging approximately 171 units over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). The most recent demand was 184 units. Current on-hand inventory is 58, and there is a significant pipeline of 642 units. Lead times have been stable at 4 periods since the disruptions observed around P8-P9. To maintain sufficient stock levels while accounting for the current high-demand plateau, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L). I've set N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (P16-P25), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers 5 periods (L+1) of this elevated demand (roughly 171 * 5 = 855 units base stock). This will balance the high service level required for a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio against the risk of overstocking if demand mean fluctuates slightly.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~171) now sustained for 10 consecutive periods (P16-P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' continues, with a demand of 144 in Period 26. Since Period 16, the average demand has been approximately 169 units per period. I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 to capture this entire high-demand regime (P16-P26) to calculate the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) for the base stock calculation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P22 order arrived in P26). With on-hand inventory at 34 and a large pipeline inventory (712), the backend OR logic will correctly calculate the order needed to reach the base stock level required for a (1+L)=5 period horizon. Using 'recent_N' ensures the parameters reflect the current high-demand reality rather than the historical lower average.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~169) now sustained for 11 consecutive periods (P16-P26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $785.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained and shows significant peaks, such as the 199 units observed in Period 27. Demand from P16-P27 averages approximately 171.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is very low (11 units), but in-transit inventory is high (670 units), reflecting the larger orders placed recently to combat the regime shift. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will continue using recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and volatility to capture the elevated behavior of this 12-period sustained regime (P16-P27), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~171) now sustained for 12 consecutive periods (P16-P27), with a recent high of 199 in P27.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is firmly established, starting at Period 16. Over the last 13 periods (P16-P28), demand has averaged approximately 170.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. The most recent demand (P28) was 163, and the peak was 199 in P27. The current lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to consecutive arrival confirmations up to Period 24 (observed at P28 conclude). With On-hand inventory at 23 and a significant In-transit pipeline of 697 units (covering orders from Periods 25, 26, 27, and 28), I will maintain the base stock logic focused on the recent high-demand regime. Using N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this specific regime while ignoring the previous lower volatility period. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), protecting against the observed high consumption rates.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~171) now sustained for 13 consecutive periods (P16-P28).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains consistently high, averaging approximately 172 units since Period 16 (14 periods). The most recent demand (Period 29) was 200, matching the upper end of this regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 696 units in transit. Lead times have been stable at 4 periods since the disruptions in Periods 8 and 9. I will continue using recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained high-demand behavior while providing enough responsiveness to the recent upward pressure (demand of 200 in P29 and 199 in P27). L=4 is reliable based on recent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~172) now sustained for 14 consecutive periods (P16-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 172 units per period over the last 15 periods. The most recent demand (P30) was 150, slightly below the recent average but within expected variance for this regime. Lead times have remained highly consistent at 4 periods since the shipment losses in P8-P9. Total in-transit inventory (710) plus current on-hand (40) equals 750 units. With L=4 and an average demand (mu) of ~172, the expected pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand, roughly 860 units. I am using 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this sustained high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher mean and the observed volatility (+/- 15-20% swings) to minimize stockouts while accounting for the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~172) now sustained for 15 consecutive periods (P16-P30).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime for chips(Regular) has been sustained since Period 16, with the average demand remaining stable at approximately 172 units over the last 16 periods. Period 31 demand was 153 units, which is slightly below the recent mean but well within the high-demand regime. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at exactly 4 periods since the initial recovery from lost shipments in early periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (21 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (721 units). Given the high demand and the 4-period lead time, I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=16 to capture the current regime's mean and use 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period arrival pattern is stable. Sigma_hat will also use N=16 to reflect the volatility of this specific high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~171) now sustained for 16 consecutive periods (P16-P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Over the last 17 periods (P16-P32), the average demand is approximately 171 units per period. The last five periods (P28-P32) show a mean of 166 units, indicating the regime remains consistent. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods since the shipment losses in P8-P9. We will use a 17-period lookback (recent_N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this entire high-demand regime, ensuring our base stock covers the current mean and observed volatility while balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio. Current on-hand is 59 with significant in-transit stock, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to maintain this service level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~171) now sustained for 17 consecutive periods (P16-P32).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime for chips(Regular) has been sustained since Period 16 (18 periods) with an average of approximately 171 units per period. However, Period 33 shows a notable dip to 110 units, which is the lowest demand since the regime began. While this could be a single-period outlier, I'll use a slightly more responsive average (N=10) for mu_hat to account for potential cooling, while keeping sigma_hat responsive to the recent volatility (standard deviation remains high during this peak). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on recent consistent arrivals (P22-P29). Pipeline inventory is high (657 units), and with on-hand at 119, the total system inventory is 776, which covers roughly 4.5 periods of the current high-demand average (~171). The OR backend will calculate the base stock to maintain this coverage.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16 and has remained at a higher level ever since. For the last 19 periods (P16-P34), the average demand is approximately 166 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. Despite a slight softening in the most recent periods (P33-P34 avg 126), there is not yet enough evidence to conclude the high-demand regime has ended. I will use recent_N with N=19 to capture this entire high-demand phase. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is healthy (181), and there is significant stock in-transit (548) covering the next few periods, so maintenance of the current base stock logic is appropriate.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently shifting away from the high-demand peak (~171 units/period) observed from Period 16-32. The last three periods (P33-P35) have shown lower demand: 110, 142, and 149, averaging ~134 units. This suggests the peak has concluded. I will adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window of N=5 (covering P31-P35) to capture this cooling trend (average ~134). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent consistent arrivals (P29-P31 orders arriving on time in P33-P35). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 177 units, and pipeline inventory is substantial (546 units), reflecting the larger orders placed during the previous period. Transitioning to a recent window for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help reduce over-ordering as demand moderates while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 33: High-demand peak (~171) has subsided; recent demand (P33-P35) averages ~134 units (-22%).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (~172 units/period between P16-P32) has clearly shifted. A new lower-demand regime started at Period 33. The demand for the last four periods (P33-P36) is 110, 142, 149, and 116, resulting in an average of 129.25 units/period. This represents a significant and sustained decrease from the previous average. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 208 and in-transit at 433, we are currently well-stocked. To avoid excessive holding costs during this lower-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new regime. This will lower the target base stock and prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: High-demand period (P16-P32, avg ~172) has ended. New lower-demand regime (P33-P36) averages ~129 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward from an average of ~172 units (Period 16-32) to ~125 units (Period 33-37). Recent demand observations are 110, 142, 149, 116, and 111. The current on-hand inventory is 258, with 314 units in transit. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. Given the lower demand regime and high existing inventory levels (on-hand + in-transit = 572), I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the last 5 periods (avg = 125.6) to prevent excessive overstocking. Sigma_hat is set to default (using all samples) to provide a safety buffer against the high historical volatility observed in this SKU.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P33-P37) average confirmed at ~126 units/period, a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime of ~172.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift initiated in Period 33 is now well-established. Over the last six periods (P33-P38), demand has averaged 128.5 units/period (110, 142, 149, 116, 111, 143), which is significantly lower than the previous regime (~172). I am setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. Current on-hand inventory (210) plus in-transit stock (352) is 562 units. With an expected lead time of 4 periods and a mean demand of approximately 128, the target base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) should be around 640-650 units. The pipeline is currently slightly under this level despite recent lower ordering, so the OR backend will likely place a moderate replenishment order to maintain the service level for the new regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P33-P38) average stabilized at ~129 units/period, down from ~172.

Daily Reward (R_t): $427.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following the high-demand peak (P16-P32). Since Period 33, demand has averaged approximately 130.6 units per period (P33-P39 samples: 110, 142, 149, 116, 111, 143, 156). The most recent demand (156 in P39) is higher than the previous few periods but still aligns with the post-peak average. Lead times remain stable and consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 197 units, with 324 units in-transit (orders from P36, P37, P38, P39). To align with the current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to capture this new 'normal' since Period 33. This balances the need to reduce overstacking from the previous high-demand period while maintaining sufficient safety stock for recent volatility (std dev of P33-P39 is approx 18).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P33-P39) confirmed: average demand is ~131 units/period, a ~24% reduction from the P16-P32 peak (~172).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. After a lower-demand period (P33-P39, avg ~131), Period 40 saw a spike to 173. This suggests the demand might be returning to the previous high-demand levels (avg ~172) or simply exhibiting higher volatility. To be responsive yet stable, I will use a N=8 window (P33-P40) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the most recent stabilization period plus the latest spike, resulting in a mean demand of approximately 136 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P31, P32, P33, P34, P35, P36 all arrived with lead_time=4). The backend OR will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers (4+1) periods of demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 40 (173 units), potentially ending the lower-demand regime (P33-P39 avg ~131).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a significant upward shift over the last two periods (P40: 173, P41: 176), compared to the previous regime (P33-P39) which averaged ~131 units. This suggests the lower-demand period has ended, returning to high levels seen earlier. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to an under-shipment in P41 (only 42 units arrived from a P37 order). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To prevent prolonged stockouts during this potential new high-demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to quickly capture the upward trend (avg ~168 per period). Sigma_hat is also updated using N=3 to account for the heightened volatility and capture the current demand spike, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher service level to restore on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 40: Demand returned to high levels (avg ~175 for P40-P41), ending the lower-demand regime observed from P33-P39 (~131 avg).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted back to a high-demand state starting at Period 40. The average demand for the last three periods (P40-P42) is approximately 182 units (173, 176, 197), which is a significant increase from the ~131 units observed in the P33-P39 window. This return to high demand aligns with the historical peak regime (P16-P32), which averaged ~172 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to quickly capture the current upward trend. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to account for the increased volatility associated with the regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 40: High-demand levels returned (avg ~182 for P40-P42), ending the lower-demand regime of P33-P39 (~131 avg).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted back to a high-demand phase (avg ~182 for P40-P42), following a brief lower-demand period (P33-P39). This shift has led to immediate stockouts, with Period 43 ending at 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp return to high demand and the current stockout situation, I need to adjust mu_hat to reflect this new regime (N=4, covering P40-P43: 173, 176, 197, 169) to maximize the service level for the upcoming lead time plus review period. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility of this phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 40: High-demand levels sustained for 4 periods (P40-P43 avg ~179).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 40, returning to a high-demand state. For the last five periods (P40-P44), demand has averaged 169.6 units (173, 176, 197, 169, 133). While Period 44 saw a slight dip to 133, this follows a string of very high demand days. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the shift from P40 onwards) to capture this higher mean (~170) while allowing the OR backend to recalculate variance (sigma_hat) based on this same recent window. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on recent conclusions (P40-P44 all arrived with L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 40 confirmed: average demand is ~170 units/period (P40-P44), reverting to levels similar to the P16-P32 peak after a brief lower-demand period (P33-P39).

Daily Reward (R_t): $717.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again in Period 40, returning to high levels. Over the last 6 periods (P40-P45), demand has averaged 172.1 units (173, 176, 197, 169, 133, 185), which is consistent with the high-demand regime observed between Periods 16-32 (~172 units). Period 44 saw a brief dip to 133, but Period 45 returned to 185. I'm using N=6 for mu_hat to capture this current high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), pipeline inventory is very high (684 units). Since orders placed now (P46) will arrive in P50 (the final period), I will maintain the base stock to cover expected demand but remain mindful that any inventory left after P50 resolution will incur holding costs without further sales opportunities.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~172) sustained for 6 consecutive periods (P40-P45) following the brief dip in P33-P39.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that resumed in Period 40 remains sustained through Period 46. For the last 7 periods (P40-P46), demand has averaged 166.8 units (173, 176, 197, 169, 133, 185, 135). I will set N=7 for mu_hat to capture this current regime while accounting for recent fluctuations. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P42 order arrived at the end of P46). Inventory levels are being managed after a period of stockouts; 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 will help set a buffer against the observed volatility within this high-demand phase (ranging from 133 to 197). This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current high-activity level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~167) sustained for 7 consecutive periods (P40-P46) following the P33-P39 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $626.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-demand state. For the period P40-P47, the average demand is 168.6 units. While P46 saw a dip to 135, P47 immediately returned to a high of 181. Current on-hand inventory is 98 units, and the pipeline is substantial (601 units). The lead time has consistently stayed at the promised 4 periods. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50) while being mindful that orders placed now will arrive in Period 52, which is outside the game window. However, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic requires consistent parameters to manage the existing pipeline and current on-hand against the demand forecast. I will use a recent_N of 8 (covering the current high-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current mean of ~169 and its associated volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a high-demand regime since Period 40. For the last 9 periods (P40-P48), demand has averaged approximately 165 units. Although there have been fluctuations (197 in P42 vs 133 in P44), the sustained average is significantly higher than the P33-P39 dip (~131). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 147 units on hand and 603 units in transit, the inventory position is adequate, but we must maintain parameters that reflect the current high-demand reality. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stats of this current regime (P40-P48), and allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a (4+1) period horizon. This ensures we cover the expected demand of ~825 units (165 * 5) plus a safety buffer while account for the units already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~165) sustained for 9 consecutive periods (P40-P48) following the P33-P39 dip; volatility remains moderate but requires updated sigma estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $691.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that resumed at Period 40. From P40 to P49, the average demand is 167.3 units per period. Although there is some volatility (e.g., a high of 197 in P42 and a low of 133 in P44), the mean has remained consistently high. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the entirety of this current high-demand regime (P40-P49). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current stability/volatility of this period. Lead time L is maintained at the default promised 4 periods, as arrivals have been consistent with the 4-period promise since the losses in P8-P9. Total pipeline inventory is high (617), but current on-hand is low (65), necessitating accurate parameter settings to ensure incoming shipments cover the next (L+1) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~167) sustained for 10 consecutive periods (P40-P49) with stable 4-period lead times.
