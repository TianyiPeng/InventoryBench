Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 97.2 (110, 116, 74, 101, 85). The promised lead time is 4 periods. In-transit and On-hand inventory are both currently zero. To ensure we have enough stock considering the 4-period lead time (covering the 4 periods of delivery + the current decision period, totaling 1+L = 5 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the mean of the available historical samples (N=5). The system is in its initial state, so no lead-time drift or lost shipments can be confirmed yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 126 units which are now in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we expect that order to arrive during Period 5 and be reflected in the Period 6 start observation. Historical demand for the first 5 samples shows a mean of 97.2 (110, 116, 74, 101, 85). However, the observed demand in Period 1 was 139, which is significantly higher than the initial history. Given we have a total of 6 samples now (5 historical + P1), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 to include this recent high value while still smoothing over the history. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4 as no arrivals have occurred yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has been 139 (P1) and 114 (P2), with provided pre-game samples showing a mean of 97.2 over 5 periods. Combining all 7 samples gives an average demand of 112.7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected to arrive in P4 resolution and be visible in P5's start), we continue monitoring for lead-time accuracy. Currently, on-hand is 0 and 269 units are in transit (126 from P1, 143 from P2). The backend requires parameters for Period 3's order decision. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture recent higher demand levels (avg ~110), and 'default' for lead time and sigma, which leverages the backend's standard calculations for the promised lead time of 4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. The goal is to set OR parameters to optimize inventory for Period 5. 

1. Lead Time Analysis: Promised L=4. Period 1's order is expected to arrive in Period 5's arrival resolution phase (visible at the start of Period 6). Current arrivals are 0, which is normal for L=4. No evidence of lost shipments yet. Lead time estimate remains at 4.

2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand across Periods 1-3 (and seed data for P1-P5) ranges from 74 to 139. 
- Mean of P1-P3: (139 + 114 + 117) / 3 = 123.3.
- Seed data (P1-P5): (110+116+74+101+85) / 5 = 97.2.
Combining these, recent demand shows higher volatility and slightly higher mean than the seed data. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current trend (Period 1-3 average is 123). Since L=4, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat will use the 123 average multiplied by 5.

3. Inventory: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 407 (Orders from P1, P2, P3: 126+143+138). With a lead time of 4, we expect the pipeline to start arriving next period. The OR backend will calculate the order based on the deficit between base stock and pipeline inventory.

4. Parameters: 
- L: Default (4).
- mu_hat: recent_N (N=3) to focus on the observed demand in the game so far.
- sigma_hat: recent_N (N=3) to account for the actual observed variance.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (total 553 units in-transit). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (126 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the current on-hand inventory of 0 and arrived=0 in previous periods is consistent with the promised lead time of 4. Demand has been relatively stable, with historical samples of 110, 116, 74, 101, and 85 (mean \u2248 97.2). Since we are in the early stages and have not seen any arrivals yet, I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and the mean of all 5 available demand samples to set parameters. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * mean_demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1914.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (from Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds so far. Average demand over the last 5 periods is 116.8 (139, 114, 117, 112, 102). There is a slight downward trend in demand, but the sample size is small. The backend OR logic uses (1+L) periods of demand to set the base stock. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Total pipeline (24 on-hand + 482 in-transit = 506) is currently quite high relative to expected demand (5 * 116.8 = 584). I will use the default lead time and standard statistical methods to allow the OR engine to stabilize based on the full history of 5 demand points.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) averages 97.2. Observed demand in the last 6 periods (139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102) averages 114.3. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods based on Period 1 and Period 2 orders arriving in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Currently, we have 65 units on hand and 435 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). The backend OR engine uses a base stock policy covering (L+1) periods, which is 5 periods here. Using recent_N=6 for demand forecasting captures the actual realization since the game start. Mu_hat should cover (1+L) periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $997.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from the 'conclude' messages for Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms an actual lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods (orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived in P5, P6, and P7 respectively). Demand history: P1:139, P2:114, P3:117, P4:112, P5:102, P6:102, P7:60. There is a slight downward trend in demand, particularly the drop to 60 in P7. However, with only 7 data points, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent behavior (averaging approximately 99 units per period) while maintaining some stability. The inventory position is currently 143 (on-hand) + 419 (in-transit) = 562 units. Setting L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods) with mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (avg ~99 * 5 = 495) suggests we are currently well-stocked, but we must maintain the base stock to cover through the lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $631.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a steady lead time (L=4) as orders from P1-P4 have all arrived exactly on schedule. A notable demand shift occurs starting Period 7: demand dropped from an average of ~114 (P1-P6) to an average of 53 (P7-P8), roughly a 53% decrease. This coincides with a large on-hand inventory (243) and significant in-transit (287). To prevent overstocking and high holding costs while demand is low, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent downturn (including P6, P7, P8). Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: average demand decreased from ~114 to 53 (-53%) over the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2202.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a significant drop in Periods 7 and 8 (60 and 46 units), demand spiked back to 125 units in Period 9. The average demand across these last three periods is 77 units, which is significantly lower than the initial baseline (~114). I will use N=3 for demand and standard deviation to capture this new, lower-but-volatile regime. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1-P5 arrive every cycle exactly 4 periods later), so I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize these observations. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 173 + In-transit: 232) are high relative to the recent demand average, which should result in smaller or zero orders via the OR backend to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile but shifted: Average demand Periods 7-9 is ~77 units, compared to ~114 in Periods 1-6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1991.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile but distinct shift around Period 7. While early periods (1-6) averaged ~114 units, the subsequent periods (7-10) have seen a drop and then a recovery, with values of 60, 46, 125, and 113. The average for the last 4 periods is 86 units, which is significantly lower than the overall historical average but captures the recent upward trend from the Period 8 low. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 156 units and in-transit is 272 units (covering orders from Periods 7-10). To set the OR parameters, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and its volatility, and set L to default since it aligns with the observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean after Period 6: Mean demand for Periods 7-10 is ~86 units, compared to ~114 units in Periods 1-6.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift after Period 6. Historical demand for Periods 1-6 averaged ~114, whereas Periods 7-11 averaged ~83. Current on-hand inventory (207) plus in-transit stock (295) equals 502 units. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is high (~95%), necessitating a base stock that covers L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (avg 83, std ~32). This results in a mu_hat of approx 415 (5*83), which is comfortably covered by current pipeline inventory, likely resulting in a zero or small order to maintain efficiency while protecting against the lower demand mean.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a clear regime shift starting Period 7. Before P7, mean demand was ~114. From P7 to P12, demand has been more volatile but generally lower: [60, 46, 125, 113, 71, 95], averaging ~85 units. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the system calculates (1+L) * mean, and L=4, we are aiming for (1+4)=5 periods of coverage. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this lower demand regime (P7-P12). This will provide a more accurate mu_hat for the OR engine to calculate the base stock and order amount, preventing excessive holding costs from over-ordering based on the higher initial demand period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing a lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 7, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift compared to Periods 1-6. In the first 6 periods, the mean demand was approximately 114.6 units. From Period 7 to 13, the mean is approximately 86.8 units (60, 46, 125, 113, 71, 95, 97). This indicates a lower demand regime. The carry-over insights correctly identified this shift. I am choosing a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime and its associated volatility. While Period 13 reports 0 arrivals, this is consistent with the order placed in Period 9 (which was 0). We expects the order of 136 units from Period 10 to arrive in Period 14. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods based on history, so L=default (4) is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed lower: Mean demand for Periods 7-13 is ~87 units compared to ~115 in Periods 1-6.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted after Period 6. For Periods 7-14, the mean demand is approximately 83.5 units, compared to ~115 in Periods 1-6. Period 14 demand was 61, continuing the trend of lower/volatile demand. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving consistently around that window (except for the zero arrival in Period 13, which corresponded to the zero order in Period 9). On-hand inventory is 104 units and pipeline inventory is 375 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (1 + L). With a mean of ~83.5, the required base stock is around 417 units. Our total position (On-hand 104 + In-transit 375 = 479) is currently slightly above the base stock requirement, but we must account for the lower recent demand mean (N=8, covering Periods 7-14) to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1811.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted after Period 6. From Period 7 to 15, the mean demand is approximately 85.7 units (Sum: 60+46+125+113+71+95+97+61+103 = 771 over 9 samples), compared to the initial mean of ~114 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P10 arrived P14, P11 arrived P15). Order P9 (ordered 0) effectively resulted in no arrival at P13, which is consistent. We have 146 units on hand and 272 in transit. Given the lower stabilized mean, I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Setting L to default (4 periods) is appropriate as observations consistently match the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3074.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16). There is a confirmed demand regime shift after Period 6. From Period 7 to 16, the average demand is 93.4 units, which is significantly lower than the Period 1-6 average of ~114. However, recent demand shows high volatility (e.g., P16 demand was 163). I am using recent_N=10 to capture this lower mean regime while accounting for the recent spike. With On-hand inventory at 23 and 342 units In-transit, the pipeline is high, mostly due to orders placed in Periods 13-16. These orders (93, 97, 42, 110) are expected to arrive in Periods 17-20. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use N=10 to reflect the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 7-16 averaged ~93 units, a ~18% decrease from the first 6 periods, but with increased volatility (range: 46-163).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked to 167 units, depleting all on-hand inventory and resulting in a stockout (only 116 units sold). This spike confirms a shift from the lower demand regime (~93 units) observed since Period 7 towards a higher volatility or level, as recent demands have been 103, 163, and 167. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 13 order. Pipeline inventory is currently 401 (orders from Periods 14-17), with a 97-unit shipment expected to arrive in Period 18. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stabilized but volatile demand since the Period 7 regime shift, which now includes these recent high-demand periods. This will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to better protect against stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/volatility increase confirmed at Period 17: recent demand (P16: 163, P17: 167) significantly exceeds the previous Period 7-15 average of ~85 units, leading to stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently experiencing a significant demand spike and a stockout situation. Demand in Period 18 reached 186 units, following 167 in P17 and 163 in P16, which is more than double the average seen in the P7-P15 period (~87 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (P14 order arrived in P18). To recover and prevent further lost sales, I need to adjust the OR parameters to reflect this higher demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand trend (averaging ~172 units over the last 3 periods), ensuring the base stock level targets this higher volume. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time of 4 periods matches the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 16-18 average 172 units, a 100% increase compared to the P7-P15 baseline. Continued stockouts occurred in P17 and P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $798.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 163, 167, 186, and 181, averaging 174.25 units per period. This is a significant jump from the previous baseline. We have experienced stockouts for three consecutive periods (P17, P18, P19) because arrivals (based on orders from the lower-demand period) were insufficient. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since my current on-hand inventory is 0 and I have 622 units in transit (matching orders from P16-P19), I must ensure the OR backend uses a forecast reflective of this new high-demand regime. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 focuses on the 174.25 average. I will also increase sigma_hat using the same N to account for the increased volatility seen in this new peak, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to stop the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~174) confirmed across Periods 16-19, causing stockouts due to lagged arrivals from the previous lower-demand regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand for the most recent five periods (P16-P20) is approximately 176.2 units, a substantial increase from the previous baseline. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 since Period 17) because arrivals reflect previous, lower order quantities (based on the lower demand regime). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover from the stockouts and satisfy this higher demand level, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime. Setting L to 'default' uses the confirmed 4-period promised lead time. This will raise the base stock level significantly to account for (L+1) periods of high demand, while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Periods 16-21, demand increased to an average of ~170 units (163, 167, 186, 181, 184, 137), compared to the prior Period 7-15 average of ~87 units. Although Period 21 saw a slight cooling to 137, the last 6 periods average 169.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 15 and a large in-transit pipeline of 747 units (from aggressive recent orders), we must maintain high parameters to bridge the supply gap until the large orders from Periods 18-21 arrive. I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this high-demand regime, which provides a mu_hat covering the (L+1) period horizon based on recent consumption levels.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Periods 16-21 average ~170 units, a ~95% increase from the P7-P15 baseline. Volatility remains high.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the mean demand is approximately 170.4 units (163, 167, 186, 181, 184, 137, 175), showing significantly higher volume compared to the earlier baseline. Lead time is consistently behaving at the promised 4 periods. With only 7 units on-hand and 735 in-transit (reflecting previous aggressive orders made during the stockout phase), we need to ensure the base stock levels reflect this new mean to maintain a high service level while the pipeline catches up. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime drift while being responsive to the high volatility seen in this period (standard deviation is roughly 16.5).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stable: Average demand from Period 16 to 22 is ~170 units (range 137-186), necessitating higher base stock levels than earlier periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. For the last 8 periods (P16-P23), mean demand has been approximately 172 units, which is a nearly 100% increase from the prior regime (P7-P15 avg ~87). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is recovering after several stockouts, but to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), we must remain aggressive. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this new high-demand regime specifically. This ensures the base stock reflects the current 170+ unit market reality rather than the historical 90-110 unit average.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 24, the mean is approximately 171.1 units (163, 167, 186, 181, 184, 137, 175, 175, 172). This is a significant shift from the previous baseline of ~93 units. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, with the Period 20 order arriving in Period 24. We currently have 46 units on hand and 696 units in-transit. The OR backend uses the promised lead time (L=4) for its base stock calculation of (1+L). Using recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this high-demand regime (Periods 16-24) while filtering out the lower demand from earlier periods. This should maintain a service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~171) is now well-established (Periods 16-24), showing consistent volume and lower volatility compared to the initial transition phase.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is approximately 172.4 units, representing a significant increase from the middle-period baseline (~90 units). Lead times have consistently remained at 4 periods, confirmed by sequential arrivals from P17 through P25. Current on-hand inventory is 56, with a substantial pipeline of 671 units. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), a high service level is required. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this established high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand periods. This ensures the base stock reflects current market reality and mitigates stockout risks observed during the transition phase.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains stable and sustained. Analysis of the last 11 periods (P16-P26) shows an average demand of approximately 170 units, which is significantly higher than the earlier P7-P15 baseline. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Inventory levels are recovering from the stockouts seen between P17-P20, as the higher orders placed during that peak are now arriving. The current on-hand inventory of 67 units plus the pipeline of 705 units is being managed to meet this higher demand (mu_hat target around 850 units for L=4). I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime and its associated volatility while ignoring the outdated lower-demand historical data.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 27, the average demand is approximately 172.25 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrivals (orders from P22 and P23 arrived as expected). The current on-hand inventory is 41 with 669 units in-transit. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), a slightly higher safety stock is warranted to prevent stockouts observed in the early transition phase (P17-P20). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this high-demand regime precisely (Period 16 to Period 27). The lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P27) stable at ~172 units/period; lead time confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 172 units since Period 16. Period 28 saw a demand of 163, following demand of 199 in Period 27. The mean demand for the last 13 periods (P16-P28) is approximately 171.4 units. Lead-time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 52 and high in-transit quantities (697 units), the pipeline is well-stocked. We use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, stable regime which began at Period 16 (28 - 16 + 1 = 13 samples available). L is set to calculate to maintain the 4-period historical average. This strategy ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate while pipeline inventory prevents over-ordering.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high-demand regime beginning at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 29, the average demand is approximately 173 units per period. The standard deviation in this period is roughly 19.5. The lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5 through 29). Currently, on-hand inventory is 21 and 700 units are in-transit. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5 periods). Given the high demand and the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, a high service level is preferred. I will use the last 14 samples (Period 16-29) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime accurately.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 173 units over the last 15 periods (P16-P30). Recent demand shows some fluctuation (P27: 199, P28: 163, P29: 200, P30: 150), but remains consistently high. Lead time is reliably confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of shipments from Periods 22 through 26. To capture the current regime most accurately while allowing for the observed variance, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 15 periods (N=15) since the demand shift occurred at Period 16. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies maintaining a robust base stock to avoid stockouts, which were a significant issue earlier in this regime transition.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P30) remains stable with a mean of ~173 units per period and a lead time of 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, with a high mean of approximately 173 units per period. The recent demand history (Periods 16-31) shows a consistent pattern with some volatility (range roughly 137-200). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as seen in the arrival data. At the start of Period 32, we have 44 units on-hand and a significant pipeline (731 units), which accounts for orders placed from Period 28 to 31. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N lookback of 16 periods (Period 16 to 31) to capture the current high-demand regime's mean and variance. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on the relevant distribution rather than the long-term historical average which includes the lower demand period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. In the most recent 16 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is approximately 171 units with relatively moderate variance compared to the initial transition. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 82 units and a substantial pipeline (676 units) consisting of orders from Periods 29 to 32. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is maintaining a high service level to prevent stockouts while the system is in this high-demand phase. I will continue using recent statistics (N=17) to capture this regime accurately for the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1946.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~85-93 to ~172 units per period. Recently, there has been a Slight cooling or increased variance in demand, with Period 33 showing a lower demand of 110. However, most samples since Period 16 support a mean near 170. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this established high-demand regime while allowing for the recent fluctuation. I will use N=18 to cover the period range from P16 to P33. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the ~170 average demand across the lead-time plus review period (1+L = 5 periods).

Recent demand (P31: 153, P32: 164, P33: 110, P34: 142) shows a slight cooling or fluctuation around a slightly lower mean, but the broader regime since P16 remains the most relevant. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 206 and in-transit at 571, the total pipeline is 777. Given a 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5), and a mean demand around 170, the expected demand over the lead time is ~850. I will use a recent window of 19 periods (since the regime shift at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures this high-demand environment while allowing for recent fluctuations. The backend OR logic will then determine the necessary order to reach the target base stock, while the internal cap helps mitigate over-ordering if demand is slightly softening.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P34) remains the dominant pattern with a mean of ~170 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 166.5 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P31-P35) show a slightly lower average of ~143.6 units, but given the critical role of maintaining a high service level (Profit: $19 vs Holding Cost: $1), it is safer to base the forecast on a slightly longer recent window to avoid under-stocking. I will use a window of N=20 for mu_hat to capture the current regime's mean (~166.5) and N=20 for sigma_hat to account for the overall volatility of this regime. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival history (P31 order arriving in P35). Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 16 continues to be the dominant pattern, with a slight cooling in the most recent periods (P33-P36 demand: 110, 142, 149, 116). The mean demand since Period 16 is approximately 166 units, but the last 4 periods average 129 units, suggesting either a temporary dip or a new secondary shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat (averaging Period 22-36) to capture the higher volume established while beginning to incorporate the recent softening. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Pipeline inventory (550) plus on-hand (241) is substantial, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering to prevent excessive holding costs given the recent demand slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand softening: Period 33-36 average demand is 129 units, compared to the Period 16-32 average of ~174 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear softening over the last five periods (P33-P37), averaging approximately 126 units per period, compared to the previous high-demand regime (P16-P32) which averaged ~174. Specifically, the last two periods (P36, P37) recorded demands of 116 and 111, suggesting a stabilization at this lower level. Currently, there is 291 units on-hand and 493 units in-transit. With lead time stable at 4 periods, total pipeline inventory plus on-hand covers more than enough for the L+1 window (~630 units needed vs ~784 available). I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the softening demand (approx 125.6 * 5 = 628) and use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the slightly lower but still present volatility. L remains at the promised and confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: Periods 33-37 average demand dropped to ~126 units (a ~28% decrease from the P16-P32 average of ~174).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2459.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downwards starting around Period 33. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P33-P38) is approximately 123 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~170. This downward trend is sustained and significant enough to warrant a pivot in parameters. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this lower mean while acknowledging the volatility observed (range 110-149). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to reduce on-hand inventory, which has climbed to 258 units, while maintaining a safe service level for the new, lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: average demand decreased from ~170 to ~123 (-28%) based on local window P33-P38.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2727.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 33, moving from an average of ~170 to a lower mean. Based on periods 33-39 (N=7), the average demand is 132.5 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 237 units, with 316 units in transit. Since we are entering the final 10 periods of the game (total 50), I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of N=7 to reflect this softening demand trend and ensure we don't over-order, which would lead to high holding costs as the game concludes. L is kept at 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~133 units (based on P33-P39), approximately a 22% reduction from the P16-P32 high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3079.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a softening period. Analysis of the most recent eight periods (P33-P40) shows a mean demand of approximately 137 units per period, which is a clear step down from the ~174 units seen during the high-demand peak (P16-P32). The latest demand observation of 173 in Period 40 suggests volatility remains, but the consensus since Period 33 supports a lower average. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this regime change (P33-P40). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory of 208 and in-transit units of 337 are being managed to align with this lower expected demand to minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift at Period 33: Mean demand for P33-P40 has settled at ~137 units, a ~21% decrease from the previous high-demand regime (P16-P32 avg: ~174).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 33. The mean demand for the most recent 9 periods (P33-P41) is approximately 141 units, which is a decrease from the peak high-demand regime (P16-P32 avg: 174) but higher than the initial softening observed. Period 40 and 41 saw a return to higher demand levels (173, 176), suggesting volatility remains high or a slight upward correction within this regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 136 and a significant pipeline of 409 units, focusing on the recent 9-period stats (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a balanced forecast that accounts for the current 141-unit average while respecting recent volatility. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 33 with a mean of ~141 units (P33-P41), showing a ~19% reduction from the P16-P32 peak but with higher volatility in the most recent two periods (avg 174.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2584.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 40. While there was a 'softening' observed between Periods 33-39 (averaging ~136 units), the last three periods (P40-P42) have seen demand surge back to 173, 176, and 197 units respectively (avg 182). This has resulted in a stockout at Period 42 ending. The order from Period 38 was for 0 units, and Period 39 was for only 68 units, creating a significant inventory gap as these reach their arrival window. The pipeline inventory is currently 592, which includes orders from P39 (68), P40 (165), P41 (176), and P42 (183). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the recent volatility and the return to high demand levels while discounting the exceptionally low demand from P33 and the zero-order impact from P38. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand transitioned back to high levels starting Period 40: P40-P42 average demand is ~182 units, reversing the softening observed in P33-P39. This caused a stockout in P42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1292.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back to a high-demand regime. After a brief softening (P33-P39, avg ~133), demand for the last four periods (P40-P43) has jumped to 173, 176, 197, and 169 (avg ~179). This sudden resurgence combined with a zero arrival in Period 42 (from the Period 38 zero-order) resulted in stockouts in Period 42 and 43. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit pipeline (720 units) consists of orders from P40 (165), P41 (176), P42 (183), and P43 (196). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the return to high demand and recent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this 'bounce back' regime (P40-P43) and ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to recover and meet the current high demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand returned to a high-volume regime starting Period 40: P40-P43 average demand is ~179 units, comparable to the P16-P32 peak (~174) and significantly higher than the P33-P39 lull (~133).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a high-volume regime. After a brief softening (P33-P39 avg ~133), demand from P40-P44 has averaged 169.6 units, closely mirroring the previous high-demand peak (P16-P32 avg ~174). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since P40, demand values have been: 173, 176, 197, 169, 133. The low demand in P44 (133) follows several high periods, suggesting high volatility rather than a new downward shift. Because the system is recovering from stockouts in P42 and P43, and the 'In-transit' quantity (755) includes several large recent orders (P41: 176, P42: 183, P43: 196, P44: 200), the base stock calculation must account for this renewed high demand to prevent further stockouts while avoiding over-ordering as these large shipments arrive. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this return to high volume (P40-P44), and default lead time (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand returned to high-volume regime at Period 40: P40-P44 average demand is ~170 units, matching the P16-P32 historical peak and reversing the P33-P39 softening (~133).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a high-volume regime starting at Period 40. The average demand from Period 40 to Period 45 is approximately 172 units (samples: 173, 176, 197, 169, 133, 185), which aligns with the historical high-demand peak observed between Periods 16-32 (~174 units). The previous 'softening' period (P33-P39) is no longer representative. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this recent high-demand stabilization, and sigma_hat using the same window to address the current volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (23), but there are 726 units in transit, including a zero order from P38 and a missed arrival from P42 which resulted in a stockout. Setting parameters to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (target service level ~95%).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime returned at Period 40: Mean demand P40-P45 is ~172 units, consistent with the P16-P32 peak (~174) and significantly higher than the P33-P39 dip (~133).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the high-volume regime first observed between Periods 16-32. Since Period 40, the average demand is approximately 172 units (last 7 periods), which is significantly higher than the temporary dip seen between Periods 33-39 (avg ~133). While demand in Period 46 dropped slightly to 135, the overall trend supports maintaining a high base stock to avoid the stockouts experienced in Periods 42 and 43. Current on-hand inventory is 71, and 735 units are in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture this return to high demand while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent window (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-Period 39 regime (+5 periods of lead time buffer). L is set to calculate to use the stable historical performance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P40-P46) mean demand is ~173 units, comparable to the P16-P32 peak (~174) and significantly higher than the P33-P39 dip (~133). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back into its high-volume regime since Period 40. The mean demand for the most recent 8 periods (P40-P47) is approximately 168.6 units, which is consistent with the long-term high-demand baseline observed between Periods 16-32. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), and orders placed now (P48) arriving in Period 52 (after the game ends), the primary objective is to utilize the existing pipeline inventory (657 units) and current on-hand (86 units) to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing further holding costs. Calculating mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) captures the return to high demand while avoiding the bias of the earlier P33-P39 dip. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to capture the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2454.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back to a high-volume regime since Period 40. Analysis of the demand from Period 40 to Period 48 shows a mean of approximately 172 units/period (P40: 173, P41: 176, P42: 197, P43: 169, P44: 133, P45: 185, P46: 135, P47: 181, P48: 137). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P43-P48). Currently, there are 149 units on-hand and 642 units in-transit. To ensure we cover demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), the backend policy will calculate a base stock target. Given the return to high demand and some volatility (standard deviation remains significant), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (covering the transition back to high demand starting at P40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime without being skewed by the brief P33-P39 dip. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the historical 4-period lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3484.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand pattern (P40-P49) confirms a return to the high-demand regime, averaging 167 units per period, which is significantly higher than the P33-P39 dip (~133). While there is periodic volatility (ranging from 133 to 197 in the last 10 periods), the mean has stabilized. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P45's order in P49. With on-hand inventory at 107 and a substantial pipeline of 618 units (covering orders from P46-P49), the strategy is to maintain the current demand forecast using a 'recent_N' approach to capture the high-volume regime while smoothing out the short-term fluctuations observed in the last 10 periods. Selecting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a stable estimate of this current regime's mean and variability.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P40-P49) stable: mean demand for the last 10 periods is ~167 units, confirming a sustained return to peak levels after the P33-P39 softening. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.
