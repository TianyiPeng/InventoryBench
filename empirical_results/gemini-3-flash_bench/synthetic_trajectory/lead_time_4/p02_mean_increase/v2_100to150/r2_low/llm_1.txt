The promised lead time is 4 periods. My pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is currently 0. To prevent stockouts, I need to cover the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period's demand (Total = L + 1 = 5 periods). Using the historical average demand of ~97 units, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 485 units. Since there is no on-hand inventory or orders in transit yet, I will place an initial order of 485 units to establish a pipeline that covers the lead-time window.",

Since I need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand and the pipeline already contains roughly 3-4 periods of demand at the current rate (485 / 150 \u2248 3.2), I will place a smaller supplemental order to account for the Period 1 demand spike and build a safety buffer for the next 5 periods.",

The promised and actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. My objective is to maintain a pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) that covers demand for L+1 periods (5 periods). Given the game ends at Period 50, orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive in time to satisfy demand (since L=4, P47 order arrives P51). Therefore, I must ensure inventory is sufficient for the remaining periods without over-ordering near the end. Total periods left = 6 (P45-P50). Total expected demand = 150 * 7 (including current P44) \u2248 1050 units. Current total inventory (On-hand 29 + In-transit 615) = 644. To reach the 1050 target, I need roughly 406 more units. Distributing this across the remaining ordering periods (P44-P46) suggests approximately 135-150 units per period. I will order 155 to maintain a small safety buffer against variability while ensuring I don't exceed the end-of-game requirements.",
