Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical data for the last 5 periods shows demand for chips(Regular) as [88, 148, 80, 84, 103]. The mean of these samples is 100.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 27.9. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock level. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (implying the base stock should roughly equal the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period, L+1). I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately while acknowledging the lead time components (1+L).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order of 147 units (placed in Period 1) is in transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase). Since we started with 0 inventory and lead time is \u2265 1, we could not satisfy Period 1's demand (99). The historical demand for Period 1-5 suggests a mean demand of approximately 100.6 units per period. For Period 2, I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and the mean of the available historical samples (Period 1-5) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since there is no evidence yet of lead-time shifts or demand regime changes, I will use default or calculation-based methods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have observed demand for 5 periods (including historical data) ranging from 80 to 148, with an average of approximately 101 units. In-transit inventory is 289 units (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P6 start message. Thus, the current 'arrived=0' in P1 and P2 concludes is normal. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we haven't received any shipments yet, we are currently losing all demand. To recover and cover future demand, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock level. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand statistics to capture the most recent averages (mean ~101). Given L=4, mu_hat calculation is (1+4)*101 = 505. This helps ensure the pipeline covers more than the immediate deficit.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 with 0 on-hand inventory and 400 units in-transit. The game history shows demand is steady around 100 units (samples: 99, 100, 99). Orders placed in Period 1 (147 units), Period 2 (142 units), and Period 3 (111 units) have not arrived yet. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect the Period 1 order to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing lost sales because on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 4 (calculated from HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA provided in the prompt) is 84. The mean of the first 5 samples provided in the prompt is (88+148+80+84+103)/5 = 100.6. I will use the default promised lead time (L=4) as we have not yet reached the arrival window for the first order. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the initial behavior, which averages approx 100 per period. This results in a required base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~500 units). Since 400 units are in-transit, the OR backend will order to close the gap to the base stock level.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. According to the lead time rules, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Evidence from Period 1 to 4 shows arrivals are 0, which is consistent with a lead time of at least 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 485 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Demand has been remarkably stable, ranging from 99 to 104 over the first 4 periods (mean ~100.5). For Period 5, I will use the default promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), since we have a very stable recent demand pattern, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current mean of approximately 100.5 per period. Over (1+L)=5 periods, this totals ~502.5. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the low volatility seen in the game history (std dev ~2.4). The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that accounts for the pipeline and ensures we start meeting demand once arrivals begin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the conclusion of Period 5, the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time). This confirms L=4. Demand history shows relative stability (99, 100, 99, 104, 90), with an average of approximately 98.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 57, and we have 356 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, 5). Given the target base stock logic (L+1 periods of demand), we need to cover demand until the order placed now (P6) arrives at the start of P11. With L=4, mu_hat should target (4+1)*~100 = 500 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the stable demand mean and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as the lead time is performing as promised and variance is low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2). This validates L=4. Demand analysis: Samples for P1-P6 are 99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131. The average is approx 104. Period 6 saw a slight peak (131), but there is not yet enough evidence for a sustained regime shift. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)). This means the OR backend will aim for the median demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate the observed lead times and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to use all historical data, as there is no clear evidence of a shift that negates the early samples. Current on-hand (68) and in-transit (293) total 361 units, which covers about 3.5 periods of average demand (104 * 3.5 = 364), aligning with a policy aiming for a lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing the 'conclude' messages: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4), Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4), and Period 3 order arrived in Period 7 (L=4). The actual lead time is consistently 4. Demand history shows values: 99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131, 71 (excluding initial seed samples, prioritizing actual period demand). Mean demand is approximately 99 units. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory position: On-hand (108) + In-transit (318) = 426 units. Total expected demand for 5 periods is ~495. I will use 'default' for L (which is 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=7 to capture the actual game history established so far, allowing the OR engine to calculate the safety stock based on the observed variance and profit/holding cost ratio (q=0.5, z*=0).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (consistent over the first 3 arrivals).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Operating at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as verified by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 100 units over the last 8 periods (min 71, max 131). The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 303) plus on-hand (86) totals 389 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. With an average demand of ~100, the baseline requirement is ~500 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it matches the observed data and 'default' for mu/sigma to utilize the full historical average, which is stable around 101 units per period.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 9 (104 sold, 111 demand). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 all arrived with lead_time=4). Historical demand across the first 9 periods shows a mean of approximately 101.3. For Period 10, demand is expected to remain stable. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 (5) periods of demand. With L=4, mu_hat should target approximately 507 total units (101.3 * 5). The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is currently 398 units. The OR backend will order the difference between the base stock and this pipeline. I will use recent_N for demand parameters to capture the stable but slightly fluctuating demand observed since Period 1.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in the last two periods, resulting in lost sales. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the arrival history (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 104 units over the first 10 periods. Since on-hand is zero and we have significant in-transit inventory (428 units), the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using the average demand of 104, the target base stock is approximately 520 units. With 428 units in transit and 0 on hand, the backend will order roughly 92 units plus any safety stock. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~104 units over the last 10 periods (excluding the first few samples). Analysis of arrival history (P5 through P11) consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, we have 37 units on hand and 386 units in transit (ordered in P8, P9, P10, and P11). In P11, we satisfied all demand (99 units) but left with a slim on-hand inventory. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (mu_hat). We will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (post-initial-fluctuation) and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to accurately reflect short-term volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the conclusion messages.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable. Since Period 1, the mean demand has hovered around 103 units per period. I've observed 8 completed order arrivals (from orders placed in Periods 1 through 8), all confirming a lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, in Periods 9, 10, and 12, the ending on-hand inventory hit zero, indicating stockouts and lost sales because demand exceeded the available arrivals. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 422, which corresponds to orders from Periods 9 (113), 10 (109), 11 (94), and 12 (106). Since 113 units from Period 9 should arrive during Period 13, I will maintain the base stock logic. I will use the last 12 samples (all history from P1-P12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there are no distinct regime shifts identified yet. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate given the consistency.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 113.8 units over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), up from the initial phases. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time (proven by 9 arrivals from P5-P13). With lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory is critically low: on-hand is 0 and recent periods (P9, P10, P12, P13) reached zero ending inventory, indicating stockouts or near-stockouts when demand slightly exceeds arrival. To ensure better service levels given a Profit/Holding ratio of 1.0 (implying a 50% target cycle service level in the base-stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) and standard deviation (N=5) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history. L remains 'default' (4).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, the system is facing frequent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 5 out of the last 6 periods). Demand has slightly increased and become more volatile, with the last 10 periods averaging ~109 units compared to the initial 5 samples averaging ~100. Because holding cost equals profit ($1.0 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. Given the frequent stockouts, I need to ensure the parameters reflect the most recent demand regime (last 10 periods) to better cover the pipeline demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in demand and variance while keeping L at its calculated value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 6: average demand increased from ~100 to ~109 (+9%) with increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 6-15) shows an average demand of approximately 111.4 units, which is a significant increase from the initial baseline (~100). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last three periods), indicating that our base stock is not high enough to cover the increased mean and volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed in the game history. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 453 (which covers orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15), we need to ensure the OR backend uses the more recent, higher demand profile. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime (Periods 6-15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the increased level and variance. This will adjust the base stock to better mitigate the stockout risk under the current lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, a massive demand spike occurred (280 units), which is more than double the previous regime average (~109). This indicates a potential significant regime shift or a one-time event (e.g., a holiday or promotion). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 448 units in-transit. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high stockout risk demonstrated in the last 5 periods (ending inventory has been 0), and the extreme spike in P16, I will use recent metrics to adapt. For mu_hat, I will use the last 11 samples (Periods 6-16) to capture the higher mean reflected in the Carry-Over Insights, but since the P16 spike is so extreme, I'll allow the OR engine to use recent variance for sigma_hat to increase safety stock. Setting L to default (4 periods) as observed lead times are stable.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand and massive spike in Period 16 (280 units) suggests a volatile high-demand regime or seasonal peak starting around P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. The current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 530 units in-transit. Looking at the history, demand spiked significantly starting in Period 16 (280 units) and Period 17 (289 units). This follows a previous shift observed around Period 6. The current lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. Because we are experiencing a massive demand surge (likely a seasonal peak), we must adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this new regime. The mean of the last 5 samples (P13-P17) is approximately 183 units. For the OR backend, mu_hat represents the expected demand over (L+1) periods. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 captures the most recent peak (avg ~224), which is safer than using a longer history that includes the lower demand period. Sigma_hat also needs to increase due to the extreme variance observed in the spike; using N=3 for sigma_hat reflects this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge confirmed: Period 16-17 demand averaged 284 units, a 160% increase over the previous regime average (~109).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are in a massive demand surge that began in Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 280, 289, and 280, averaging 283. This is a dramatic increase from the previous average of ~109. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have significant lost sales. We are expecting 113 units to arrive in P19 (ordered P15), but demand is far outstripping current arrivals. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method based on the current regime average of ~283 multiplied by (1+L) where L=4 (total 5 periods of demand coverage). mu_hat = 283 * 5 = 1415. For sigma_hat, I will also use an explicit value reflecting the high volatility of this new regime; while the recent demand is stable near 280-290, the jump itself represents massive variance, so I'm setting a high sigma to maintain a high service level. Lead time L is consistent at 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Demand for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) has been 280, 289, 280, and 264, averaging 278.25 units. This is a massive shift from the previous average of ~109. The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 1074 units in-transit, reflecting recent aggressive ordering to catch up. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, meaning base_stock will target the median demand. To ensure the backend uses the most relevant data for this new regime, I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the recent surge while the OR backend's L+1 multiplier (5 periods) will correctly project demand over the lead time and current period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~278) confirmed persistent for 4 periods (P16-P19) following the Period 16 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shifted into a significantly higher regime starting at Period 16. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has been 280, 289, 280, 264, and 322, yielding an average of approximately 287. This is a dramatic increase from the previous average of ~109. We are currently experiencing frequent stockouts because the arrivals (from historical orders placed during the lower-demand era) are insufficient to meet this new demand level. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. To capture this new demand level and its increased volatility, I am using a recent_N (N=5) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (L+1) period window with the most relevant data from the current high-demand regime, aiming to lift the base stock level to prevent ongoing lost sales. Pipeline inventory is high (1269) because of the large orders placed in recent periods (P17-P20) to chase this demand; these will begin arriving in Period 21.

Carry-over insight: P20 update: High-demand regime (P16-P20) average demand now calculated at 287 units, with sustained volatility (max 322).

Daily Reward (R_t): $183.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from an average of ~109 to a high-volatility peak averaging ~273 over the last 6 periods (P16-P21: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203). Although P21 saw a drop to 203, it remains substantially higher than the pre-P16 levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' balance is high (1252) due to massive orders placed between P18 and P20 (396, 394, 296) to catch up with the surge. Current on-hand is 0. The incoming order from P18 (396 units) is expected to arrive during P22 resolution, which should bridge the stockout. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this new high-demand regime, while sigma_hat will also reflect the recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock. Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 22 update: High-demand regime (P16-P21) average demand calculated at 273 units, with a slight cooling observed in P21 (203) compared to the P16-P20 average (287).

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observed a demand of 336 units, significantly higher than Period 21 (203) and confirming that the high-demand regime (starting P16) remains active despite the brief dip in P21. We now have 7 periods of data for this new regime (P16-P22). The average demand for this period (P16-P22) is 282 units. Holding costs and profit are balanced at $1.0 each, implying a target service level of 50%, though the backend OR logic uses the profit/holding cost ratio for its base stock calculation. Inventory has finally replenished with a large arrival (396 ordered at P18), leaving 60 units on-hand and 969 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this high-demand regime (P16-P22) accurately while excluding the lower-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Period 23 update: High-demand regime (P16-P22) average demand is 282 units (N=7), showing continued volatility (range 203-336) compared to the previous regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, transitioning from an average of ~109 to a high-demand peak averaging 282 units over the last 8 periods (P16-P23). Period 23 saw a demand of 282, aligning perfectly with the current regime mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history. With inventory finally recovering (on-hand 172, in-transit 928), the goal is to maintain the high service level required by the 50% critical ratio (Profit=1, Holding=1) while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation ~42 in the current regime). I will use the recent 8 periods (N=8) to capture this high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) period risk horizon (5 periods) without excessive over-ordering as the pipeline is now full.

Carry-over insight: Period 24 update: High-demand regime (P16-P23) average demand remains 282 units (N=8), maintaining consistency with the previous period's average and confirming sustained high demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift starting at Period 16. In the most recent 9 periods (P16-P24), demand has averaged approximately 285.7 units (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336, 282, 315), which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~109. Although Period 21 showed a dip to 203, subsequent demand has returned to the 280-330 range. Inventory is finally recoverying as the larger orders placed from Period 18 onwards are arriving. With on-hand at 153 and in-transit at 942, we are nearing a stable stock position for this high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 captures this new mean (approx 285.7 * 5 = 1428.5) and sigma_hat with recent_N=9 accounts for the increased volatility of this period (std dev approx 40.5).

Carry-over insight: Period 25 update: High-demand regime (P16-P24) average demand is 286 units (N=9), confirming the sustained shift with continued high volatility (range 203-336).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted from ~109 units to ~286 units starting at Period 16. Analyzing the last 10 samples (P16-P25), the mean demand is 295.6 units with a standard deviation of 47.9 units. The most recent demand (P25) was a peak of 375 units, suggesting that the high-demand regime is not only sustained but potentially still increasing in volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0 because demand (375) exceeded inventory (319) in the previous period. Pipeline inventory is high (1110) but mostly comprises orders placed after the shift began arriving. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand distribution (averaging ~296/period) while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 26 update: High-demand regime (P16-P25) average increased to 296 units (N=10), with demand peaking at 375 in P25, indicating potential for even higher peaks than previously recorded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from an average of ~109 units to a highly volatile high-demand phase. Analyzing the last 11 samples (P16-P26), the mean demand is approximately 292.5 units with a standard deviation of roughly 48.7. The most recent demand in P26 was 251, following a peak of 375 in P25, confirming sustained but volatile high volume. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to demand exceeding the small arrival of 113 units in P26 (ordered during the transition period). Large orders placed between P23-P26 (353, 310, 334, 363) are currently in-transit and will begin arriving in P27. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the OR engine's target service level is 50%. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the new mean and increased variance, while L remains at the default/confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 27 update: High-demand regime (P16-P26) average demand is 293 units (N=11), showing sustained high volume with a peak of 375 (P25) and a standard deviation spike to ~49.

Daily Reward (R_t): $243.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the high-volume regime that started around Period 16. Recent demand (P16-P27, N=12) shows an average of approximately 293.5 units per period with significant volatility (std dev ~46). The most recent period (P27) saw demand of 298, closely matching this regime average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The inventory position is high (In-transit: 1101), reflecting previous large orders placed to catch up with the regime shift. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which the OR engine's base stock formula (z*=0) naturally targets by setting base stock to the mean demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1). To ensure the backend captures the recent high-volume volatility and mean correctly, I will use recent_N with N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the entire current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 28 update: High-demand regime (P16-P27) average demand is 294 units (N=12), maintaining stability near 300 units while sustaining high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $295.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains sustained through Period 28. Calculating demand statistics for this specific regime (P16-P28, N=13): the average demand is 296.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of 45.4. Recent demand (P28) was 330 units, consistent with this volatile high-volume phase. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current pipeline inventory is large (1092 units) due to aggressive ordering in response to the regime shift, but given the 4-period lead time and the current high demand, maintaining a base stock reflecting this new 300-unit average is necessary to avoid stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture this specific regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 29 update: High-demand regime (P16-P28) average demand is 297 units (N=13), with sustained volatility (std dev ~45) and a recent peak of 375 in P25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in a high-volume, high-volatility regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the recent 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is 294.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 45.4. Specifically, the last three periods (P27-P29) have seen demand of 298, 330, and 257 (avg 295), confirming the stability of this higher mean. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 25 order in Period 29. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 112, In-transit: 1103) are being managed against this ~294 average. To ensure consistent coverage across the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility with N=14 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime, providing a robust statistical basis for the OR backend's safety stock calculations while avoiding noise from the pre-P16 low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Period 30 update: High-demand regime (P16-P29) average demand is 294 units (N=14), showing sustained high volume and volatility (~45 std dev) over a significant duration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained in a high-volume, high-volatility state. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is 292.07 units with a standard deviation of 43.68. The current status shows 214 units on-hand and 983 in-transit (orders from P27, P28, P29, P30). The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by the P26 order arriving in P30. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=15 captures this current high-demand regime more accurately than the full history, ensuring the inventory pipeline is sized for ~300 units per period while accounting for significant volatility (peaks up to 375).

Carry-over insight: Period 31 update: High-demand regime (P16-P30) average demand is 292 units (N=15), with consistent lead time of 4 periods and sustained demand volatility (std dev ~44).

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime beginning at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 16 periods (P16-P31), the average demand is approximately 293.5 units with a standard deviation of about 44. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods throughout the game history. At the start of Period 32, on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 31 where demand (316) slightly exceeded the starting on-hand (308). The in-transit pipeline (1140 units) is robust, consisting of orders from P28 (301), P29 (345), P30 (243), and P31 (251). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the 'base stock = mean' calculation (via mu_hat) target effectively. I will use N=16 for both demand mean and volatility to capture this sustained high-volume regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 32 update: High-demand regime (P16-P31) average demand is 294 units (N=16), with a standard deviation of 44, confirming long-term stability in the elevated demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16 (N=17 periods). While the previous carry-over insight noted an average of 294, the most recent demand in Period 32 spiked to 388, bringing the regime average (P16-P32) to approximately 300 units with a standard deviation of about 50. Leading time remains consistent at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (recent_N=17) to capture this stable yet volatile high-demand state. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period risk window, ensuring enough inventory is ordered to meet these elevated demand levels while managing the risk of stockouts seen in the last two periods (P31, P32).

Carry-over insight: Period 33 update: High-demand regime (P16-P32) average demand increased to 300 units (N=17) following a spike of 388 in P32, with sustained volatility (std dev ~50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in an elevated regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the last 18 periods (P16-P33), the average demand is approximately 300 units (mean = 300.06) with a standard deviation of approximately 48.7. The most recent demand (P33) was 301, closely matching the regime average. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P30-P33). Because the current inventory (on-hand 44 + in-transit 1140 = 1184) must cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), and 5 * 300 = 1500, the pipeline is currently under-stocked relative to the target base stock. I will use recent_N with N=18 to capture the statistics of this high-demand regime while maintaining L=4. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher volume and increased volatility observed since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Period 34 update: High-demand regime (P16-P33) average demand is 300 units (N=18), with stable volatility (std dev ~49).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16. In the most recent 19-period window (P16-P34), the average demand is approximately 300 units with a standard deviation of 49. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. As of the start of Period 35, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 1199 units in-transit (orders from P31-P34). The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy. To ensure the base-stock reflects the current regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=19, covering the entire high-demand period. This informs the backend of the ~300 unit average and high volatility, allowing for a safety stock calculation (z-score) that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (target 50% service level). L is fixed at the observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 35 update: High-demand regime (P16-P34) average demand is 300 units (N=19), with a stable standard deviation of 49. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 298 units with a standard deviation of about 48. Lead time has been perfectly consistent at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (1235 units) reflects orders placed in Periods 32-35. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current high-demand regime while providing enough samples to estimate volatility accurately. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the profit/holding cost ratio (equidistant at 1.0, implying a 50% critical fractile, though the capped policy and safety stock math will generally target higher levels to ensure availability).

Carry-over insight: Period 36 update: High-demand regime (P16-P35) average demand is 298 units (N=20), with persistent volatility (std dev ~48). Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Over the last 21 periods (P16-P36), the average demand is approximately 298 units with a standard deviation of approximately 48. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand (345) exceeding the arrival (316) in Period 36. The in-transit pipeline (1164 units) is substantial, but given the 4-period lead time and the high demand (averaging ~300), we must ensure the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for both the sustained mean and the observed volatility to avoid stockouts. I am using 'recent_N' with N=21 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime for mean and volatility calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 37 update: High-demand regime (P16-P36) average demand is 300 units (N=21), with a standard deviation of 48. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the last 22 periods (P16-P37), the average demand is approximately 300 units with a standard deviation of about 48. Period 37 concluded with demand at 262, lower than the recent average but within the expected variance. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods throughout the game history. With the game ending at Period 50, and current period being 38, we have 13 decision periods remaining. Given the lead time of 4 and the OR engine's objective to maintain a service level balance (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% target service level in a simple model, but the backend uses the base stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 to capture the full extent of this stable high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant data since the structural shift occurred at Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Period 38 update: High-demand regime (P16-P37) average demand remains 300 units (N=22), with a standard deviation of 48 and a consistent lead time of 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 300 units and a standard deviation of 48. The most recent period (P38) showed a demand of 230, which is on the lower end of the current regime range (203-388) but still consistent with the overall volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 140 and In-transit inventory at 1113, the total pipeline is 1253 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock roughly around 5 * 300 + Z * sqrt(5) * 48 is needed. The OR backend's cap and base stock logic will handle the specific ordering, but I will provide the regime-specific parameters (N=23 for P16-P38) to ensure the forecast reflects the sustained high-demand state rather than the old lower-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Period 39 update: High-demand regime (P16-P38) average demand remains 297 units (N=23), with persistent volatility (std dev ~48). Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable at an elevated level since Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 24 periods (P16-P39) is approximately 296 units, with a standard deviation of 48. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 162 units and there is a significant in-transit pipeline of 1042 units (covering orders from P36-P39). To maintain the optimal base stock for the next 5 periods (L+1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime, ensuring parameters are tuned to the specific mean and volatility of this phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 40 update: High-demand regime (P16-P39) average demand is 296 units (N=24), with standard deviation stable at 48. Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained elevated since. For the last 25 periods (P16-P40), the average demand is 293.4 units with a standard deviation of 48.9. Recent demand in the last 4 periods (P37-P40) has slightly softened (avg 246), but given the historical volatility and the objective to maximize reward (Profit $1 vs Holding $1), a service level around 50% is targetted by the backend (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use N=25 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full extent of the current high-demand regime while smoothing out recent minor fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the sustained volume and volatility seen since the Period 16 shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 41 update: High-demand regime (P16-P40) average demand is 293 units (N=25) with a standard deviation of 49, despite a slight softening observed in the four most recent periods (P37-P40 avg: 246).

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 293 units (N=26) and a standard deviation of 49. Although the most recent block of four periods (P37-P40) showed a slight softening (avg 246), Period 41 saw demand return to the regime average at 328 units. Therefore, I will maintain the use of the recent_N method with N=26 to capture the full scope of this high-demand period while accounting for its inherent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. The on-hand inventory is currently 179 units with 943 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 26 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand during the lead time plus current period (L+1=5) and maintains a safety stock appropriate for the observed 50:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 42 update: High-demand regime (P16-P41) average demand remains stable at 294 units (N=26) with standard deviation of 49. Demand returned to regime levels in P41 (328) after a brief 4-period dip.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains stable through Period 42. Since the transition to this regime at P16, the average demand is 294 units (N=27) with a standard deviation of 48. Recent demand (P41: 328, P42: 280) follows this pattern closely, confirming that the brief softness observed around P37-P40 has resolved. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=27 captures the full characteristic of the current high-demand regime while filtering out the initial low-demand phase (P1-P15). This ensures the base stock calculated by the OR backend reflects the current average volume and volatility required to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 43 update: High-demand regime (P16-P42) average demand stable at 294 units (N=27), with standard deviation of 48 and lead time strictly 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 294 units and a standard deviation of 48. Despite a minor softening between Periods 37-40, demand returned to regime levels in Periods 41-43 (328, 280, 304). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. To ensure we capture the most relevant demand behavior while accounting for this sustained high-volume regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=28 (covering Period 16 to Period 43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the long-term stability of the current regime with enough sensitivity to recent fluctuations without overreacting to the minor dip seen earlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 44 update: High-demand regime (P16-P43) average demand remains stable at 294 units (N=28), with standard deviation holding at 48. Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 294 units and a standard deviation of 48. Recent performance (P41-P44) shows demand remaining robust (328, 280, 304, 286). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P40 order arriving in P44). With 37 units on-hand and 1135 units in-transit (covering orders from P41, P42, P43, P44), our pipeline is well-stocked for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will continue using the high-demand regime (starting at P16, which is 29 periods ago) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, capping N at 20 for the recent_N method to capture the stable but volatile nature of this regime while weighting the more recent patterns slightly more effectively.

Carry-over insight: Period 45 update: High-demand regime (P16-P44) continues with an average demand of 294 units and a standard deviation of 48. Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we see the conclusion of Period 45: 215 units arrived (ordered in P41), confirming the lead time remains precisely 4 periods. The demand in Period 45 was 271, which aligns closely with the established high-demand regime average of ~294 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrival (215) and existing on-hand (37) were insufficient to meet the demand (271). However, 1217 units are in-transit, which covers the expected needs for the remainder of the game (ending at Period 50). Since we are at Period 46 and the lead time is 4, any order placed now will arrive at the arrival phase of Period 50, making it available to satisfy Period 50'S demand. To set parameters for the OR engine, I will use 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture the full stability of the current high-demand regime (starting P16) while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high mean (~294) and the significant volatility (std dev ~48).

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 294 units and a standard deviation of 48. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods without any missing shipments or drifts observed in the 'conclude' messages. As we are approaching the end of the game (Period 47 of 50), the strategy focuses on maintaining sufficient stock to cover the remaining periods while managing the risk of ending with excessive inventory. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=31 (the length of the current high-demand regime from P16 to P46) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory calculations reflect the sustained elevated demand levels. Lead time L is set to 'default', which aligns with the observed consistent 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: P46 update: The high-demand regime (P16-P46) remains stable with an average demand of ~294 units and a standard deviation of 48. Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $311.00, Daily Holding Cost: $17.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains stable, with current average demand around 294 units and a standard deviation of 48. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we are at Period 48 of a 50-period game, the decision for Period 48 arrives in Period 52, which is beyond the game's end. However, the decision for Period 48 impacts demand resolution in Period 48, 49, 50. In-transit inventory is 1124 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current rate (~294 * 4 = 1176). The system is well-stocked. I will continue using recent_N (N=32, covering the entire high-demand regime from P16-P47) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain the current service level while minimizing terminal inventory risk as the game nears completion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains stable through Period 48. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, with 1,132 units in-transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 16 (a duration of 33 periods), the mean demand (mu) is approximately 294 units per period with a standard deviation (sigma) of approximately 48. The next arrival (ordered P45) is expected during Period 49. To maintain the service level across the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I am using 'recent_N' with N=33 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mean and volatility, ensuring the OR engine computes a base stock that accounts for the observed volume and variance since the last major shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 49 update: High-demand regime (P16-P48) remains stable with N=33 periods of data. Average demand is ~292 units, \u03c3 \u2248 48. Lead time remains strictly 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $169.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 292-294 units and a standard deviation of 48. Recent demand (P46-P49) remains consistent with this regime (285, 311, 228, 281). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 112 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked at 1053 units. Given the high volatility (max demand observed was 388), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=34 (the length of the current regime P16-P49) to ensure the base stock calculation accurately reflects the current high-demand environment and provides enough safety stock to handle peaks without excessive holding costs.
