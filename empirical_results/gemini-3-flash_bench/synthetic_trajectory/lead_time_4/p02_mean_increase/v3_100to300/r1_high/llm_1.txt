Historical data for the first 5 periods indicates an average demand of approximately 100 units (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. To maximize total reward, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since starting on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must place an order immediately to build a pipeline. Given the initial average demand of ~100 units/period, a 5-period requirement is roughly 500 units. I will order 500 units to establish the pipeline and mitigate the impact of the 4-period lead time delay.",

Therefore, the order is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be first visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6).

Total estimated demand for these 5 periods is ~500 units. I currently have 500 units in transit arriving around Period 5. To ensure I have stock for Period 6 and beyond, and to build a small buffer given the initial stockout, I will place another order now. Ordering 500 more units ensures that once the pipeline starts flowing, I have a consistent supply to meet the ~100 units/period demand without overextending on holding costs immediately, as these units won't arrive until Period 6.",

Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods to ensure availability for the period after the next arrival. Current Inventory Position (On-hand 108 + In-transit 1495) is 1603 units. Total demand to cover through P34 is calculated as follows: Demand for P30 (the current period, already accounted for in pipeline logic), P31, P32, P33, and P34. Using a conservative forecast of 320 units/period (reflecting the higher end of the recent regime), the 5-period requirement is 1600 units. My current pipeline (1603) already covers this target. However, since P30 is the decision phase for an order arriving in P34, and given that ending inventory has been zero or low for many periods, it is prudent to maintain a steady inflow. Comparing the In-transit arrival schedule: P30 arrival (P26 order: 505), P31 arrival (P27 order: 240), P32 arrival (P28 order: 350), P33 arrival (P29 order: 400). To cover P34 (arriving at the end of P34), I should order roughly one period's demand now to maintain the pipeline. I will order 320 units to match the projected demand for P34.",

Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the simulation (P44-P50), our objective shifts towards meeting demand while minimizing ending inventory. Current on-hand is 460 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 685 units, consisting of orders from P40 (100 arrive P44), P41 (150 arrive P45), P42 (210 arrive P46), and P43 (225 arrive P47). Total inventory available to cover through P47 (4 periods of demand) is 460 + 685 = 1145 units. Expected demand for P44-P47 is ~1100-1120 units. To cover P48 (as an order placed today, P44, arrives at the start of P49 decision phase), we need about 280 additional units. Total inventory target for lead time (4) + 1 period = 5 * 280 = 1400. Currently have 1145 in pipeline/on-hand. Therefore, an order of 255 (1400 - 1145) is appropriate. Since the game ends at P50, and we are at P44, orders placed after P46 will not arrive in time to be sold. I will order 255 to maintain a safe service level for the upcoming periods.",

The demand for the most recent periods (P41-P44) has been 328, 280, 304, and 286, averaging approximately 300 units per period. This suggests the cooling trend noted in P41 was temporary, and demand has returned to the 285-305 range. With a lead time of 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 45 plus the 4-period lead time (P46-P49), totaling 5 periods. Total required stock = 5 periods * 300 units/period = 1500 units. Current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 274 + 840 = 1114 units. To reach the 1500 unit target and maintain a service level for the remaining periods (ending at P50), I need to order approximately 386 units.

Total expected demand for P47-P50 is ~1140-1160 units. The pipeline is sufficient to cover all remaining periods.
