Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_4\p02_mean_increase\v3_100to300\r2_med\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 88), ('Period_2', 148), ('Period_3', 80), ('Period_4', 84), ('Period_5', 103)]
  Mean: 100.6, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no prior demand history beyond the provided samples (5 periods: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103), I will use those to initialize the forecast. The average demand is 100.6 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 27.9. Based on the lead time L=4, the review+lead period covers 5 periods (1+L). The target base stock should cover demand for these 5 periods. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to calculate initial values from the provided history while monitoring for actual lead time performance in future periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 147 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), resulting in 0 sales and 0 ending inventory for Period 1 since starting inventory was 0. Demand in Period 1 was 134, which is significantly higher than the initial sample provided (88). Looking at the provided samples (Periods 1-5), there is a clear upward trend and then stabilization (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). Given the current demand of 134 in Period 1, the mean of the samples is approximately 100.6. Since we are in the early stages, I will use the 'default' lead time of 4 and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to stay responsive to the early fluctuations. Since we only have 1 period of live data plus the 5 samples, N=6 will cover the available history.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are still in transit as expected (actual lead time hasn't been confirmed yet, but no evidence of delay exists). On-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit is 300 (147 + 153). Demand in P1 was 134 and P2 was 79. Since demand realization happens after arrivals, and no arrivals occurred yet, units sold remain 0. Based on the 5 pre-game samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) and the 2 active game periods (134, 79), there's no clear regime shift yet. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize all available data points (7 samples total) and the promised lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) while accounting for the current pipeline of 300 units.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4, and the on-hand inventory is 0. Promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, it is normal that we have seen 0 arrivals in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1, 2, and 3. The initial demand history provided (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) averages roughly 100 units/period. The game history demand for the first three periods (134, 79, 124) averages 112 units. This indicates consistent demand around 100-110 units. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and the mean of all available historical samples to set the base stock level. Since the review + lead time period is 5 (L+1), and the mean is roughly 100-110, mu_hat should naturally land around 500-550. My goal is to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 576 units in-transit. The game history shows that all demand from Periods 1-4 was lost (sold=0) because no inventory arrived. This is consistent with the promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 (arriving at L=4). Therefore, the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see in Period 6) should show the first arrival. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is [88, 148, 80, 84, 103], with an average of 100.6. Since we have zero on-hand and a long lead time, the OR backend must maintain a high base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat/sigma_hat to utilize the full available sample history, as there is no clear regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the Period 5 conclude message, the order from Period 1 arrived after exactly 4 periods (promised lead time), confirming L=4 is currently accurate. Total pipeline inventory is 448 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), with 60 on-hand. Demand history for 5 periods is: 134, 79, 124, 137, 87. The average demand is 112.2 units with moderate volatility. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My forecast for mu_hat will use all available samples (N=5) as there isn't yet a clear regime shift, though demand is fluctuating. I will set L to default (4) and use the recent 5 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and variance accurately for the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4), and the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 6 (lead_time = 4). Historical demand samples are [88, 148, 80, 84, 103] from the prompt and [134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102] from the game history. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet in these 11 data points; they fluctuate around a mean of approximately 107. Based on all 11 points, the mean is 107.2 and standard deviation is approx 24. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. mu_hat = 5 * 107.2 = 536. sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 24 = 53.6. I will use the 'default' method for L (since 4 is confirmed) and 'default' for mu/sigma to leverage the backend's calculation over the full history, as no regime change is detected.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand samples (P1-P7) are 134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102, 48 (Mean \u2248 101.6). There is a slight downward trend in the last few periods (87, 102, 48), so I will use a shorter window (N=4) for mu_hat to be more responsive to recent shifts without reacting too drastically to the low P7 demand. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Pipeline inventory is 318 (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7), and on-hand is 212. Current parameters aim to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=4) yields a mean around 93, resulting in a base stock target that accounts for both lead time and safety stock. Sigma_hat is calculated using all available samples to capture the inherent volatility of the 'Regular' chips SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of the history shows that the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 arrived exactly 4 periods later in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively). Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable but fluctuating around a mean. The average demand across all 8 concluded periods is approximately 99.6 units (134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102, 48, 86). Using a lead time (L) of 4, the OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand (253) + In-transit (191) = 444 units. With average demand around 100, we have about 4.4 periods of coverage. I will set mu_hat to use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the more recent demand trend (avg = 85), which is slightly lower than the overall average, helping to prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a service level justified by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Based on the game history, the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by Period 9's arrival). The demand over the last 9 periods has seen a slight decline, with the mean of the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9) being approximately 73.8 units compared to the overall average of 93.6. Specifically, the last three periods (7, 8, 9) shows very low demand (48, 86, 46). I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent downward trend while staying sensitive to the previous higher levels. The inventory position is currently healthy with 226 on-hand and 249 in-transit, totaling 475 units. At a forecast of ~74 units/period and L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods), the target stock levels should be around 370-400 units, suggesting the system will likely order very little this period to bleed off excess stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a distinct downward shift starting around Period 7. The initial average (Periods 1-6) was approximately 110.5 units per period, whereas the average over the last 4 periods (Periods 7-10) has dropped to approximately 60 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 6 consecutive deliveries. Given the current high on-hand inventory (272) and in-transit units (144), the total pipeline of 416 units is significantly higher than the projected demand of ~300 units for the next (L+1)=5 periods based on recent trends. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to align the base stock calculation with this lower demand regime, which will likely result in the OR backend ordering zero units until inventory levels normalize, thereby minimizing holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Average demand decreased from ~110 to ~60 units per period (-45%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). Demand has shifted since Period 7. Earlier periods (P1-P6) averaged ~110 units, whereas more recent periods (P7-P11) have averaged approximately 70.4 units (48, 86, 46, 59, 113). The most recent demand (113 in P11) is an uptick compared to the previous four periods, but still aligns with the post-Period 7 shift. I am setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility. The L parameter remains at the promised/observed value of 4. On-hand inventory is currently high at 226 units, which is sufficient to cover roughly 3 periods of the new average demand, so the capped OR policy will likely minimize new orders to reduce holding costs.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 13. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (P5-P11) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. No order was expected in Period 12 (due to 0 orders at P8), so the 'arrived=0' is normal. A demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 7, where demand decreased from an average of ~110 to ~60. However, looking at the last 6 periods (P7-P12: 48, 86, 46, 59, 113, 68), the mean is approximately 70. The spike in P11 (113) suggests slightly higher volatility than the initial shift suggested. With On-hand (158) + In-transit (180) = 338 units, we are currently well-covered for a (L+1)=5 period horizon (5 * 70 = 350). I will use the recent N=6 periods to capture this post-shift behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead times have been stable at 4.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 7. Pre-shift (P1-P6) average demand was ~110. Post-shift (P7-P13) average demand is 78.4 (48, 86, 46, 59, 113, 68, 118). While the carry-over insight noted a drop to ~60, recent periods (P11, P13) show spikes, bringing the active regime average higher. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture this lower but volatile demand state (mean ~78.4). Lead time is stable at 4 periods as consistently observed (P9 arrived P13, lead_time=4). The P8 order was 0, so no arrival was expected in P12, which matches the history. Currently, on-hand (117) plus in-transit (164) equals 281 units. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 78.4 = 392. The system is currently under-stocked relative to this target, so the OR backend will place an order to bridge the gap.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages from Periods 5 through 13. However, the order from Period 8 (arriving in Period 12) appears to be lost or massively delayed as it did not conclude in Period 12 or subsequent periods. The demand regime shifted around Period 7, reducing from an average of ~110 to ~80. Recent demand (Periods 11-14) shows a slight uptick (avg ~100), but given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), we must be cautious. On-hand inventory is low (13), and the pipeline (290) includes the potentially lost Period 8 order (though the system still counts it until confirmed lost). I will set L to 4 (promised). For demand, I'll use the last 8 periods (Period 7 onwards) to capture the lower regime, setting N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent volatility while accounting for the structural decrease.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory was exhausted (ending at 0) as demand (126) exceeded available stock (13). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Orders from Period 12 (103 units), 13 (61 units), 14 (126 units), and 15 (129 units) are currently in-transit. The order from Period 12 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 16 (and become visible in Period 17's start). Recent demand has shown high volatility; while a previous drop was noted in Period 11, the last few periods (P11-P15) show an average demand of 105.8 units (113, 68, 118, 104, 126), which is significantly higher than the ~60 units previously estimated. I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend and volatility. Lead time (L) remains 4 based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Average demand increased from ~60 back to ~106 units per period (+76%) based on samples P11-P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a massive demand spike (368 units), which is approximately triple the recent average (~106-110). This coincides with on-hand inventory hitting zero and losing significant sales. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (Period 12 arrived in Period 16). Given this high-demand signal (possibly a seasonal event or stock-up phase), I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (Periods 11-16) to capture the higher volume seen since Period 11, including the recent outlier. This elevates mu_hat to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock to recover from the current stockout and cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time of 4 matches the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16 showed a significant spike (368 units), raising the 6-period mean (P11-P16) to ~149 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Demand has shifted dramatically starting in Period 16 (368 units) and continuing in Period 17 (297 units). The previous Carry-Over Insight noted a regime shift at P11, but the last two periods represent a massive second spike or high-demand regime, likely seasonal or event-driven. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (sold 103/368 and 61/297). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The average demand of the last 7 periods (P11-P17) is approximately 169 units, but the last 2 periods average 332.5 units. Given the high profitability ($4) vs holding cost ($1), we need a high service level. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the shift since P11 while heavily weighting the recent spikes, and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility. The 'cap' logic in the backend will moderate the order if it exceeds historical norms, but the base stock must be raised to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike confirmed starting Period 16: P16-P17 average demand is ~332 units compared to P11-P15 average of ~106 units (+213%). High volatility noted.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume/high-volatility regime starting Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16, P17, P18) was 368, 297, and 251 units respectively (average ~305 per period). Previous regimes were much lower: ~106 (P11-P15) and ~60 (P7-P10). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 942 units in transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand surge and high volatility, while keeping L at 'default' (4 periods). This targets a base stock that covers approximately 1525 units (5 periods * 305 mean), which helps the OR backend aggressively order to mitigate stockouts during this spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is currently in an extreme high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Recent demand values are: P16: 368, P17: 297, P18: 251, P19: 177. While demand is showing a downward trend from its peak, the average demand of the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is approximately 273 units, significantly higher than the baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). Inventory is currently zero on-hand due to stockouts, with 1216 units in-transit (orders from P16-P19). To maintain the necessary service level while accounting for the high volatility and recent trend, I am using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture this specific high-demand event. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this spike. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand level (1+L)*mean(recent demand).

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike regime (P16-P19) average demand is 273.25 units, compared to the previous period average of ~106 (+157%). Demand is trending downward from the P16 peak but remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $572.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 289.8 units over the last 5 periods (P16-P20: 368, 297, 251, 177, 356), though with significant volatility. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1375 units in-transit. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime is distinct and significantly higher than historical averages, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~290) and high variance observed in this latest peak. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased demand volume and the high risk of stockouts given the inventory is currently exhausted.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to 289.8 (P16-P20) from ~106 previously (+173%), with high volatility (std dev ~76 for the period).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand for the high-demand period (P16-P21) is approximately 296 units, compared to the previously observed ~106 units. Although demand fluctuates, it remains substantially elevated with high volatility (standard deviation ~69). On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units), but a massive pipeline of 1269 units is in transit, reflecting large orders placed recently to catch up. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. To maintain the 0.8 service level (calculated as 4/(4+1)) and cover the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will use the most recent 6 samples (P16-P21) to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the new mean and the significant variance observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Average demand increased to 296 units (P16-P21) from ~106 previously (+179%), with sustained high volatility (std dev ~69).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1027.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16. In the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the mean demand is ~293 units per period with a standard deviation of ~64. Although demand is fluctuating, it remains consistently high compared to the pre-P16 average of ~106. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (as evidenced by P17 and P18 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later in P21 and P22). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (69 units) while in-transit inventory is high (1273 units), representing orders from P19-P22. To maintain the service level during this high-demand regime, I am using a recent_N approach (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean of ~293 and the heightened volatility. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been highly consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: avg demand ~293 (P16-P22) vs ~106 previously (+176%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 23 is approximately 301.37 units, compared to the pre-spike average of ~106 units. Demand remains volatile but sustained at this high level (Recent samples: 368, 297, 251, 177, 356, 327, 274, 360). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 (the duration of the current high-demand regime) to capture this new mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current demand environment while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P23) average is 301.37 units, representing a 184% increase from the previous baseline of ~106.

Daily Reward (R_t): $466.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Analyzing the recent window (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 312.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 65.4. While demand in Period 24 (176) was lower, it remains part of a volatile but elevated trend compared to the pre-P16 baseline (~106). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P20 order arrived P24). Consequently, I am setting L to 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime (P16-P24), allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for this level of activity and volatility. This ensures we maintain a inventory level capable of covering the 176-368 range of demand observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P24) mean demand is 301.9 units, with significant volatility (std dev ~71.8). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the mean demand is approximately 300.6 units per period, while the standard deviation is approximately 75.9. The current period (Period 26) shows an on-hand inventory of 67 and a pipeline inventory of 1116 units. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from orders made in Periods 1-21). Given the highly volatile nature of the current regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the statistics of this high-demand period (P16-P25). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) at the required service level, while considering the recent high mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P25) mean demand is 300.6 units, with ongoing high volatility (std dev ~75.9). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~106 units to approximately 295.2 units (P16-P26 average). The volatility remains high with a standard deviation of approximately 75.8 for this period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion of all orders since Period 5 (P22 order arrived P26). I am using recent_N (N=11) to capture the current high-demand regime starting from P16 while maintaining a stable lead time estimate of 4 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to target high service levels (given Profit $4 vs Holding $1) to mitigate stockouts seen in the earlier part of this regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P26) mean demand is 295.2 units, with ongoing high volatility (std dev ~75.8). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1398.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~106 to a high-demand, high-volatility state. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 298.9 units with a standard deviation of 73.1. Individual period demand fluctuates significantly (range: 176 to 394). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P20 to P23 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). With an on-hand inventory of 54, the system is currently maintaining a lean position relative to the high demand. I am using recent_N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-demand regime while smoothing out the volatility. The OR backend's service level (based on profit $4 vs holding cost $1) will calculate a base stock that accounts for this volatility to minimize both stockouts and excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P27) mean demand is 298.9 units with high volatility (std dev 73.1). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. In the last 13 periods (P16-P28), the mean demand is 301.69 units per period with a standard deviation of 73.13. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. Since the regime is well-established over 13 periods, I am using recent_N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current sustained pattern of high mean and high volatility. The OR backend will use these values to compute a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand, ensuring we maintain sufficient service levels during this active period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $988.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16 and has remained consistently high with significant volatility. The mean demand for the period P16-P29 is 296.3, with a standard deviation of 72.8. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 29 (321) exceeded starting on-hand + arrival (247). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (P16-P29) to capture this sustained high-demand regime while excluding previous lower-demand periods. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 29. The pipeline inventory (1396 units) is substantial, but since demand is currently exceeding supply due to the recent low arrival (122 units from a low order in P25), maintaining a base stock calculated from the high-demand regime is necessary to recover and meet service levels.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P29) mean demand is 296.3 units with high volatility (std dev 72.8). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $719.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand since Period 16 has remained in a high-demand regime, though exhibiting significant volatility. The mean demand for the period P16-P30 is approximately 291.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 71.8. Period 30 data (demand 229, following a 321 in P29) shows the continuation of this volatile high-demand state. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., P26 order arriving at P30). I will use a recent_N approach with N=15 to capture this high-demand regime (P16-P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the updated mean (~292) and variance for its base-stock calculation, accounting for both the higher baseline and the significant fluctuations observed over the last 15 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $737.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime (starting Period 16) continues with significant volatility. The mean demand from Period 16 to Period 31 is approximately 291 units. Although demand in the last two periods (Period 30: 229, Period 31: 235) is slightly below this mean, it remains well above the previous baseline (~106). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 16 samples (P16-P31) effectively captures the current high-demand regime and its variability. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine the base stock level, balancing high selling potential against holding costs for the ending inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $877.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable phase from Period 16 to Period 32, the average demand is approximately 291 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 71. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P30, P31, and P32). Using recent_N with N=17 (covering P16\u2013P32) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) provides a balanced estimate of the current high-demand environment while accounting for its inherent variability. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 4-period consistency. With current on-hand inventory at 299 and 1007 units in-transit, the OR backend's capped policy will ensure we maintain a base stock sufficient for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while preventing excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $792.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 294.6 units over the last 18 periods (P16-P33). While there was a significant peak in P16 (368 units) and P25 (394 units), the recent 5-period average (P29-P33) is slightly lower at 273 units but maintains high volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high volume of 'In-transit' inventory (958 units) and the current 'On-hand' balance of 352 units, the system is well-covered for the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=18) to capture this entire high-demand regime since Period 16, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=18) to account for the sustained volatility observed during this period. For Lead Time (L), 'calculate' is used as the observed lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods.

=== Period 34 Summary ===

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, following an initial jump. While the most recent demand sample in Period 34 (185 units) is lower than the previous average of ~300, it is premature to declare a regime downshift based on a single data point, especially given the high historical volatility (std dev ~70-75). I will continue to use a recent_N approach targeting the high-demand period (P16 onwards, N=19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level remains sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods across all arrivals (P1 through P30 orders). The current on-hand inventory is 416 with 989 in transit, which the OR engine will account for when placing the Period 35 order.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 283 units per period (sum=5667) with a standard deviation of approximately 71 units. Lead times have remained consistently stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P26-P31). On-hand inventory is 311, and in-transit inventory is 946 (comprising orders from P32-P35: 214+290+280+162). Using the recent_N method with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the dynamics of this high-demand, high-volatility regime while ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P35) stabilized at an average of ~283 units/period with a standard deviation of ~71. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 16-36), the average demand is approximately 283.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 71.0. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 27 through 32. Current on-hand inventory is 268 units, and in-transit inventory is 1044 units. To maintain the inventory position against the current demand volatility, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21 (covering the current regime from P16 to P36). This captures the high mean and standard deviation observed recently while allowing for slight fluctuations in demand. The backend OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level that covers five periods (L+1) of demand, adjusted for the high service level dictated by the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to the most recent Period 37, the average demand is approximately 283.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 70.8. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods (validated by the Period 37 conclusion: P33 order arrived after 4 periods). Since the regime has been stable for 22 periods, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current mean and volatility while smoothing out minor fluctuations. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), effectively managing the trade-off between the $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 283 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 71 (based on the Period 36 analysis). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 38 of the order placed in Period 34. Currently, there are 204 units on-hand and 1009 units in-transit. To maintain the inventory levels required for this high-demand regime (\u03bc \u2248 283, \u03c3 \u2248 71, L=4), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23. This N covers the period from the start of the regime (P16) to the most recent concluded period (P38). This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant historical mean and variance for the current demand level while accounting for the stable 4-period lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 remains stable, with an average demand of approximately 283 units per period and a standard deviation of 71. The most recent demand (Period 39) was 299 units, consistent with this average. Lead time is reliably 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (67), but there is a significant pipeline (1202 units) scheduled to arrive over the next four periods. I will use the established regime (P16-P39) to set parameters. N=24 covers this stable period. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock to cover demand across the lead time plus one period (L+1=5), while the cap prevents excessive ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 283 units and a standard deviation of 71 (as noted in Carry-over Insights). In the most recent 10 periods (P31-P40), the mean demand is 276.9 units with a standard deviation of 48.9, showing slightly lower volatility than the earlier part of this regime. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 180, and in-transit inventory is 1188 (representing orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). Our total pipeline plus on-hand is 1368, which covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain the service level across the replenishment cycle (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=25 to capture the full stability of the current high-demand regime while allowing for recent variability. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the observed mean and variance since the major shift.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 282 units and a standard deviation of 71 units (observed between P16 and P41). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 37 order in Period 41. Currently, there is 141 units on-hand and 1125 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory is quite high relative to the average demand across the lead time (approx 5 periods of demand = 5 * 282 = 1410). However, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (80th percentile). I will use 'recent_N' with N=26 (covering the regime from P16-P41) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while ensuring the OR engine accounts for the stable 4-period lead time.

The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 283 units per period. Recent performance (P36-P42) shows demand fluctuating between 199 and 327, maintaining this high-volume profile. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P33 through P38. My strategy is to set parameters that maintain the current service level while accounting for the significant volatility (std dev ~70). I will use a window of the last 27 periods (P16-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 279 units per period (P34-P43 average = 275.9, P16-P43 average = 282.8). Standard deviation in this regime (P16-P43) is approximately 68.4. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory state: On-hand = 338, In-transit = 985 (from orders in P40, P41, P42, P43). Total pipeline = 1323. Given the Lead Time (L=4) and Review Period (1), we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 1400 units. My parameters (L, mu_hat, sigma_hat) will be tuned to the recent regime (last 20 samples to capture the stabilized high demand while filtering early extreme spikes) to allow the OR backend to maintain safety stock and sufficient ordering to cover the pipeline gap.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 29 periods (Period 16 to Period 44), the average demand is approximately 280 units per period with a standard deviation of 63.

Given the lead time (L=4) and review period (1), we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=29 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this sustained regime effectively, allowing the base-stock policy to maintain a safe inventory level while managing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit margin.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 283 units per period. The standard deviation in this regime (from P16 to P45) is approximately 64.9. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 283 units, and there are 946 units in-transit. Given that the game ends at Period 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 46) will arrive during Period 50. Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, this is the final order that will impact the total reward. The parameters are set to cover demand for the remaining 5 periods (L+1 = 5) until the end of Period 50. I will use the established regime statistics (N=30, from P16 to P45) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the stable lead time of 4.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 31 periods (P16-P46), the mean demand is approximately 276.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 60.1. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods since the start of the game. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 321 units and there are 952 units in-transit (ordered P43-P46). Given we are at Period 47 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 51, which is after the game ends. Therefore, my parameters aim to maintain the current logic while acknowledging that the inventory already in the pipeline is sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (47, 48, 49, 50). I will use the recent_N method with N=31 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained demand regime since Period 16, and use the default lead time of 4.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 10-period window (P38-P47), the average demand is 275.2 units with a standard deviation of 42.6. This shows a slight decrease in mean demand and a significant reduction in volatility compared to the earlier parts of this regime (P16-P35 avg ~283, std ~71). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the arrival in Period 47 (ordered Period 43) confirming this. Given the game is approaching its conclusion (Period 48/50), my priority is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. Current on-hand is 228 and in-transit is 970 (scheduled to arrive in P48, P49, P50, and beyond). Specifically, orders from P44 (162), P45 (281), P46 (289), and P47 (238) are in the pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the more stable recent behavior, ensuring the base stock calculation accurately captures the current mean and reduced variance to avoid late-game excess inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1165.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 275-285 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. In Period 48, demand was 311 units, and ending inventory was 79 units. With only two periods left (49 and 50), the OR backend needs to maintain sufficient stock to cover the final two windows of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=33 (covering the start of the regime at P16 to the most recent sample at P48) to capture the long-term stable average and volatility of this regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current environment without over-reacting to single-period noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1220.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16. In the most recent window (Periods 40\u201349), demand averaged 277.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 42.6. This is consistent with the long-term regime average of ~283 noted in previous carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 45 order in Period 49. Inventory currently sits with 44 on-hand and 1115 in-transit. To maintain the service level across the L+1 window while accounting for the current high-demand stability, I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods for both demand mean and volatility, which captures the current stabilized behavior better than the full history of the spike.
