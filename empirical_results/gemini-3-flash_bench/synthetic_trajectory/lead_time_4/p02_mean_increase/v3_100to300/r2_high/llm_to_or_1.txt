Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product description is 'chips(Regular)' and we have 5 historical demand samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). The mean demand is approximately 100.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 27.6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period of decision-making, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to establish a baseline. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4) * mean(100.6) = 503 and sigma_hat accordingly. No lead time data is available yet to adjust L.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 147 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 4. As expected for L=4, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrived=0 in P1 conclude). The demand in P1 was 134, which resulted in lost sales since starting inventory was 0. Demand history shows Period 1: 88 (seed), 148 (seed), 80 (seed), 84 (seed), 103 (seed), and then 134 in the first actual game period. The average demand across these 6 points is roughly 106. Since the promised lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the mean of 106, mu_hat should be around 530. I will use the 'default' methods for now to incorporate all historical samples including the recent P1 demand of 134, as there isn't yet enough evidence for a sustained regime shift or lead time deviation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Both Period 1 and Period 2 resulted in 0 sales because the initial order from Period 1 has not arrived yet (Promised Lead Time = 4). Total in-transit is 300 units (147 from P1 + 153 from P2). Historical demand samples are 88, 148, 80, 84, 103, and the demand in the first two concluded periods was 134 and 79. The mean of these 7 samples is approximately 105.14. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4 and use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using all 7 available samples (N=7) to stabilize the forecast against the initial high volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock of roughly 5 * 105 = 525 units, which will trigger additional orders to complement the 300 already in the pipeline.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 449 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first three periods has been 134, 79, and 124, averaging 112.33. Since no orders have arrived yet (as expected with L=4), we cannot yet infer if actual lead time deviates from promised. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand average (112.33) rather than the longer-term seed data which started at 88 and rose significantly. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5, which occurs after this decision phase. Consequently, we should observe the arrival of the Period 1 order (147 units) in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 610 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 88, 148, 80, 84, and 103 (from user-provided samples, though game history shows slightly different demand values of 134, 79, 124, 137 - I will rely on the samples provided in the prompt as they are explicitly labeled as the data to inform the forecast). The mean demand over these 5 periods is 100.6 units/period with a standard deviation of 27.9. With a lead time of 4, the review+lead interval is (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods), and use all 5 available samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline forecast until we see confirmed arrivals.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The first arrival (ordered P1) occurred in Period 5 with an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, 60 units are on-hand, and 520 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since we only have 5 demand samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103 \u2014 note: the demand values provided in 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' differ slightly from the 'GAME HISTORY' text, I will prioritize history: 134, 79, 124, 137, 87), the mean demand is approximately 112.2. With L=4, the pipeline inventory of 520 units is high relative to the expected demand of (L+1)*\u03bc \u2248 561. The backend OR logic for 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' will use all available samples (N=5) to stabilize the base stock level. I will stick with L=4 and default statistical methods to allow the system to calibrate as more arrivals occur.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1827.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows arrivals for orders placed in Period 1 (arrived Period 5) and Period 2 (arrived Period 6), both confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 111, with 418 units in transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). Demand for the first 6 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of ~110.5 units (134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Mean demand per period is approximately 111. Total required base stock \u2248 5 * 111 = 555. Pipeline inventory is 418 and on-hand is 111, totaling 529. The OR backend will order the difference. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full history of the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $700.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 212 units and 384 units in-transit. The confirmed lead time (L) is 4 periods, as evidenced by orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving exactly 4 periods later. Demand has shown significant variability over the first 7 periods (range 48-137), with the most recent sample (Period 7) being the lowest at 48. However, the average demand across all 7 periods is approximately 101.5. To account for current volatility while maintaining a stable base, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. Since we have passed the initial 0-inventory phase and now have a steady pipeline, I'll set N=7 to capture the full history of demand samples (134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102, 48) which better represents the product's behavior than just the recent dip. Setting L to 4 reflects the established lead time accurately. This configuration helps the OR backend target a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1347.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 287 units with 255 units in transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability (range: 48-137, mean \u2248 100). The current on-hand inventory plus upcoming arrivals (57 from P5, 51 from P6, 115 from P7, 32 from P8) is sufficient to cover demand for the next (L+1)=5 periods based on the current mean. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=8 to capture the full observed demand history after the initial setup. This approach allows the OR backend to balance the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1) while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (P1-P5 orders arrived in 4 periods). Since starting Period 5, inventory has been available and all demand has been met. The demand mean has shown a slight downward trend over the last 5 periods (avg 73.8) compared to the initial 5 samples (avg 108.6). However, because initial periods were out-of-stock, the 'demand' figures might have some noise. Since we are in the early phase (Period 10), I will use the last 9 demand samples (P1-P9) to stabilize the mu_hat calculation while discounting the pre-history samples. Keeping L at default (4) as it aligns with observations. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (9) to capture current variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $831.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 7-10) is significantly lower than earlier periods. The mean demand for the last 4 periods is approximately 60 units/period (48, 86, 46, 59), whereas the first 6 periods averaged around 108 units. Using a full historical average would overestimate demand and lead to excessive inventory/holding costs. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promise, so I use the 'calculate' method to utilize these historical observations. Current on-hand (290) and in-transit (244) totals 534 units, providing safety given the lower demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg decreased from ~108 to ~60 (-44%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1855.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Recent history shows that lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and P11 arrival). Demand experienced a regime shift around Period 7. From Period 7 to 11, demand was [48, 86, 46, 59, 113], averaging 70.4 units/period, down from the initial average of ~108. Although P11 showed a spike (113), the overall trend since P7 is lower. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. Current on-hand inventory (292) and in-transit (129) are high relative to recent demand, so the OR backend will likely temper ordering to minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the current profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted since Period 7. The initial average (Periods 1-6) was approximately 108 units, while the subsequent average (Periods 7-12) has dropped to approximately 70 units (48, 86, 46, 59, 113, 68). The Carry-over insight correctly identified this shift. I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised, so I will continue using the default/promised lead time. Current on-hand (256) and in-transit (134) are sufficient to cover current demand, so the OR backend will likely order a small amount to maintain the base stock level according to the new lower demand parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2034.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 11-13) shows a sharp increase with demands of 113, 68, and 118, compared to the previous stable lower regime (Periods 7-10) which averaged ~60. This suggests the 'low demand' period may have been a temporary dip and demand is trending back toward the initial average of ~108. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history (P1-P9 orders all arrived exactly at T+4). Given the current high inventory (208 on-hand + 119 in-transit), I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for demand to capture the current upward trend while the OR backend's inventory balancing prevents over-ordering. L will be set to the confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing at Period 11: regime shift back toward higher mean observed (Avg P11-P13: 99.7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1845.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has returned to a higher regime after a lower dip (Period 7-10). The average demand from Period 11 to Period 14 is approximately 100.75 units (113, 68, 118, 104). The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 10 all showing a 4-period duration. On-hand inventory is 131, and Pipeline inventory is 237 (total $= 368$). Given $L=4$, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At the current mean of ~100.75, the expected demand over the lead time is ~503.75 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this most recent higher-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock levels adjust quickly to the current consumption rate while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around mean of 100 units from Period 11 onwards (P11-P14 avg: 100.75).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P11-P15) shows a stable regime with a mean of 105.8 units (113, 68, 118, 104, 126). The zero arrival in Period 15 is expected because zero units were ordered in Period 11. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (5 units), but there is a significant in-transit pipeline (375 units) consisting of orders from P12 (37), P13 (55), P14 (145), and P15 (138). To maintain visibility of the recent demand shift while accounting for the 4-period lead time, I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This covers the most recent 5 periods since the demand stabilized around 100+ units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $798.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, a massive demand spike occurred (368 units), which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. This resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Looking at historical data, Period 16 is likely a major outlier or the start of a new high-demand regime. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 481, which includes orders from P13 (55), P14 (145), P15 (138), and P16 (143). Based on the 4-period lead time, the P13 order should arrive during Period 17 (visible in Period 18 start). However, the P11 order (ordered 0) arrived in P15, and only the P12 order arrived in P16, confirming the lead time remains 4. To compensate for the stockout and the spike, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use recent history (last 6 periods, which covers the stabilization at 100 plus the spike) and using a high sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed in P16 (~2.5x the previous mean).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 16 (368 units), causing a temporary stockout. Monitoring for sustained regime change or one-time event.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Period 16 demand was 368 and Period 17 demand was 297, causing stockouts. The average demand for these last two periods is 332.5. Prior to this, demand shifted from ~60 to ~100 around Period 11, and now it has surged significantly. We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0). We have 760 units in-transit, but given the 4-period lead time, we must ensure these are accounted for while projecting future needs based on the new mean. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (arrived P17, ordered P13). I will use explicit values to capture this sudden, massive demand spike while the backend pipeline catches up, setting mu_hat based on the recent average of ~330 units per period over L+1 (5) periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime upward shift confirmed at Period 16: mean increased from ~100 to ~330 (+230%) based on P16-P17 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for the last three periods has been 368, 297, and 251, yielding an average of approximately 305 units per period. The system is currently recovering from a stockout (on-hand is 0). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock calculation must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using a recent demand mean of 305/period, mu_hat should be approximately 305 * 5 = 1525. For sigma_hat, the variance has also increased significantly along with the mean, so I am using a recent_N (N=3) approach to capture the volatility of this new regime. This strategy aims to build sufficient inventory and pipeline to meet this dramatically higher demand level while maintaining the desired service level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a massive upward shift starting at Period 16. Demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) was 368, 297, 251, and 177, averaging approximately 273 units per period. While the most recent sample (177) is lower than the initial spike, it remains significantly above the historical mean of ~100. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) and reliant on in-transit inventory. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on P15-P19 arrival data. To capture the current (though potentially cooling) high-demand regime while maintaining a high service level (Critical Ratio q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use the recent N=4 periods (P16-P19) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets the new volume while acknowledging the high volatility observed during this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2717.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 20 is approximately 289.8 units (368, 297, 251, 177, 356), which is significantly higher than the previous mean of ~100. This shift caused immediate stockouts as the inventory was not prepared for such a spike. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (P20 saw P16's order arrive). To address this new high-demand regime and recover from the on-hand stockout of 0, I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the most recent 5 periods (Period 16-20) to capture this higher mean. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to account for the increased volatility observed in this period (specifically the wide range from 177 to 368). The OR backend's service level logic (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will push for a high base stock, which is necessary to refill the pipeline and prevent further lost sales given the current 1519 units in-transit and 0 on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: mean increased from ~100 to ~290 (+190%) based on P16-P20 data.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 16. In the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand values were 368, 297, 251, 177, 356, and 327, averaging 296 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 1405 units reflects orders placed between P18 and P21 (411+403+371+220 = 1405). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P17 order (334 units) exactly in P21. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine computes a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of this elevated volume. This will help recovery from previous stockouts caused by the delayed reaction to the demand spike.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 22 is approximately 292.8 units per period, compared to the previous regime of ~100. This higher demand is sustained (7 periods), so I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume, high-variance state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data (P17-P18 orders arrived exactly on schedule in P21-P22). With a current Profit/Holding ratio of 19:1, the target service level is high (~95%), requiring robust stock coverage over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent: Mean demand P16-P22 is 292.8 units (+190% vs previous regime).

Daily Reward (R_t): $6653.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Since Period 16, the demand values have been 368, 297, 251, 177, 356, 327, 274, and 360. The average demand over these last 8 periods is 301.25 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 in Periods 21, 22, and 23 respectively. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this elevated demand regime (P16-P23). Similarly, I will use N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this new regime. The inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is currently 1349 units. Given L=4, the backend will target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (approx 1500 units), resulting in an order of approximately 150-200 units to maintain the service level across the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher mean: P16-P23 average demand is 301.25 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major upward shift at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~300. Recent demand samples from Period 16 to Period 24 are {368, 297, 251, 177, 356, 327, 274, 360, 176}, yielding an average of 287.3 units. Although Period 24 saw a lower demand of 176, this is within range of previous volatility (Period 19 was 177). I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime specifically. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 382 and a large pipeline (1191 units), our current position is strong relative to the projected base stock, but the OR backend's capped policy will ensure we maintain supply for the 4+1 period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased to ~287 units (P16-P24 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7278.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25 (10 samples), the mean is approximately 298 units (368, 297, 251, 177, 356, 327, 274, 360, 176, 394), which is significantly higher than previous periods. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (e.g., Period 21 arrival from Period 17 order). For Period 26, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (recent_N=10) to capture this higher mean and the associated volatility (standard deviation is approx 77). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 1500+ unit requirement over the (L+1) horizon while acknowledging the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 stable: P16-P25 average demand is 298.0 units with standard deviation of 76.8.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) underwent a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 26, the average demand is approximately 294.7 units per period, representing a persistent high-demand state compared to the historical average before Period 16. The most recent demand (Period 26) was 242 units, slightly below the current regime average but still within the high-volatility range observed (Standard Deviation from P16-P26 is approximately 73.1). Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the continuous arrival of orders from Periods 17 through 22. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture this high-demand regime (P16-P26), ensuring the base stock level reflects the current market reality and mitigates stockout risks associated with the high volatility in this segment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed and stable: Period 16-26 average demand is 294.7 units with a standard deviation of 73.1.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly at Period 16 and has remained stable around a mean of ~295 units. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 27 is 294.7 units with a standard deviation of 73.1. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=12 (Periods 16-27) to capture this current high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 23 order in Period 27. The large in-transit inventory (1207 units) covers roughly 4 periods of demand, which aligns with the lead time. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend will target a high service level to minimize lost sales during this peak period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6046.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly upward starting at Period 16. Since then, demand has remained consistently high. From Period 16 to Period 28 (13 samples), the mean demand is approximately 297.5 units with a standard deviation of 71.9. This regime is now well-established. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P20, P21, P22, P23, and P24 exactly 4 periods later). I will use the recent 13 samples (P16-P28) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime, and maintain the L estimate at the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 is sustained: P16-P28 average demand is 297.5 units with a standard deviation of 71.9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6039.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16 and remains stable. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, the mean demand from Period 16 to Period 29 (14 data points) is approximately 299.2 units per period with a standard deviation of 70.4. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (most recently confirmed in Period 29, where the order from Period 25 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Since the regime has been stable for 14 periods, I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this high-demand state. Although the In-transit inventory (1392) is high relative to current on-hand (60), the high demand (avg ~300) over the L+1 window (5 periods) requires a base stock near 1500-1600 units (5 * 300 + safety stock). The OR backend's capped policy will manage the actual order quantity to prevent excessive over-ordering while maintaining the target service level based on the current high-demand mean and variance.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a significantly higher level compared to the start of the simulation. For the chips(Regular) SKU, the average demand from Period 16 to Period 30 is approximately 293.1 units per period. The standard deviation over this same window is approximately 73.5. Order arrivals have consistently followed the promised lead time of 4 periods (as confirmed by the 'conclude' message in Period 30 showing the Period 26 order arriving exactly 4 periods later). Since the demand regime is clearly established and has persisted for 15 periods, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=15 to capture this specific regime's mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time L will remain set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed stability of the supply chain at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 16, following several shifts earlier in the sequence. Analysis of the data from Period 16 to Period 31 shows a mean demand of approximately 291 units with a standard deviation of approximately 74. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. Since the current period is 32 and the regime shift occurred at Period 16, I will use the last 16 samples (N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand behavior while excluding the low-demand early periods. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period risk window (5 periods) and maintains the desired service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and remains stable. Analyzing the data from P16 to P32 (17 samples), the average demand is 296.8 units with a standard deviation of 63.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival data (confirmed through Period 28's order arriving in Period 32). In-transit inventory is 1070 units, and on-hand is 360. Using 'recent_N' with N=17 (covering the current regime from P16-P32) for both demand mean and standard deviation will provide the most accurate base stock calculation for the OR backend, ensuring the pipeline covers the expected demand over the lead time and review period (L+1 = 5 periods). L is maintained as 'default' (4) which matches observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P16 remains stable through P32: Mean = 296.8, Std Dev = 63.8.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 33, the average demand is approximately 296 units with a standard deviation of 63.8. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33. Currently, there is 408 units on hand and 1022 units in transit (orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33). To ensure the OR backend accurately reflects this sustained high-demand environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the regime from P16 to P33). This will allow the base-stock calculation to account for the current mean and volatility while maintaining a safe service level (z* ~ 2.39 given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16 and has remained stable through Period 34. Since the shift at Period 16, the average demand (P16-P34) is approximately 288.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 71.0. The most recent demand in Period 34 (185 units) is lower than the mean but within a normal range given the volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 541 and in-transit at 981 (Total Pipeline: 1522), and an expected demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods) of ~1445, the current inventory position is healthy. I will use the last 19 periods (since the changepoint at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-volatility regime while maintaining a 4-period lead time estimate.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the data from P16 to P35, the average demand is approximately 283.5 units with a standard deviation of about 69.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival data (confirmed by arrivals up to Period 35). Current on-hand inventory is 436 units, and there are 943 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend should target a high service level. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture this stable high-demand regime since its inception, ensuring the base stock level reflects the 280-300 mean demand levels and the associated volatility to prevent stockouts like those seen in P16-P20.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P16 remains stable through P35: Mean = 283.5, Std Dev = 69.5 (N=20).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 283.5 units (P16-P35). Period 36 demand was 257 units, which is consistent with this regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Inventory levels are currently healthy with 392 units on-hand and 1039 units in-transit. I will continue to use a recent_N strategy for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=21, which covers the period from the start of the current high-demand regime (Period 16) to the most recently concluded period (Period 36). This ensures our stock levels are calculated based on the most relevant demand data while maintaining a stable service level.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-volume regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 285 units and a standard deviation around 68. The current on-hand inventory is 371 units, and the pipeline is substantial (998 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. I will continue using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=22 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime (Period 16 to Period 37). This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) at the required service level, while the pipeline inventory prevents over-ordering.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 285-290 units and a standard deviation around 65-70. Recent demand (P36-P38: 257, 307, 327) remains consistent with this regime (avg=297). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory status: On-hand is 321, and In-transit is 1027 (representing orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 1348 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 290 = 1450 units. The current position (1348) is slightly below the required base stock level for the current regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 (covering the start of the regime at P16) to capture the stable high-demand state while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 24 periods (P16-P39), the average demand is approximately 287.4 with a standard deviation of 63.9. Although recent demand (P35-P39) has been consistently near 300, the overall regime remains stable. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met as seen in the 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the data since the regime shift at Period 16 (N=24) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this sustained high-demand level while accounting for current volatility. The OR backend will use these to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 283 units and a standard deviation around 70. Analyzing the most recent data (P36-P40: 199, 299, 327, 307, 257), the average is 277.8, which is consistent with the established regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 299 units, and there is a healthy pipeline of 1179 units. Since the demand is stable and there are no signs of seasonality or impending calendar spikes in the provided context, I will continue to use the established regime data (last 25 periods, P16-P40) to drive the OR parameters. This ensures that the base stock calculation, which uses (1+L) periods of demand, is based on the most accurate and sustained demand profile.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in its high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 26 periods (P16-P41), the mean demand is approximately 287.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 71.0. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 37 order in Period 41. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 258 units and 1120 units in transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). To maintain the target service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will continue to use the recent_N method based on the current regime's length. Since the regime has been stable for 26 periods, I will set N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean while smoothing out minor fluctuations.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 280-290 units and a standard deviation around 65-75. Lead times have been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the shift in Period 16, the environment has shown no significant new trends or volatility spikes. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 333, In-transit: 1075) are healthy relative to the stable demand. To optimize the OR backend's base-stock policy, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=20 to capture the most relevant data from the current stable regime (P23-P42). For lead time (L), 'calculate' is used to leverage the high consistency of the 4-period lead time observed throughout the history.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since the regime shift at Period 16.

Current on-hand inventory is 450 units, and in-transit inventory is 967 units. To optimize for the 50-period limit, I will use recent_N to capture the current stable regime (N=28 covering P16-P43). This ensures the OR backend uses parameters reflecting the established higher demand level and its variation to maintain a high service level while managing holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable, although the most recent samples (Periods 40-44) show slightly lower demand (avg ~236) compared to the long-term stable average of ~290. To prevent overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the latest demand trend while still accounting for the volatility established in the 'high demand' regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. On-hand and in-transit inventory are sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time, so a standard balanced approach is appropriate.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, with a high mean demand of approximately 280-300 units. Recent demand (P36-P45) shows a slight softening compared to the initial post-P16 spike, with a mean of 270.1. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable as evidenced by consistent arrivals (P41 order arrived in P45). With 395 units on hand and 817 in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked for the 5 remaining periods. To avoid overstocking at the end of the game (ending Period 50) while maintaining service levels, I'm using a slightly shorter window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand level and volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at the higher level established around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 20 periods (P27-P46), the mean demand is 267.8 units with a standard deviation of 45.4. This is a slight decrease in mean and a significant reduction in volatility compared to the initial post-shift analysis (P16-P35), where the mean was 283.5 and SD was 69.5. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The inventory position (On-hand: 411 + In-transit: 830 = 1241) is healthy relative to the expected demand over the lead time plus current period (5 periods * ~268 = 1340). I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture this more stabilized but slightly lower demand profile for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=20 provides a robust statistical base while focusing on the current stabilized regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further (P27-P46): mean demand ~268, standard deviation ~45. Lead time remains 4 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 268 units with a standard deviation of approximately 45, as noted in the Period 47 insight. Recent demand samples (P44: 247, P45: 290, P46: 245, P47: 313) support this stable regime. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs. Current on-hand inventory (322) plus the significant in-transit pipeline (908) is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the rest of the game (~268 units/period * 3 periods = 804 units). However, the OR backend's order logic uses the pipeline to compute the final order. Setting parameters to 'recent_N' for N=20 (covering the stable period from P27 onwards) will provide the OR engine with accurate mean and volatility estimates for this regime to maintain the target service level efficiently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5678.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P27-P48) indicates a stable regime with a mean of approximately 268 units and a standard deviation of 45. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on lead-time arrival confirmation (P48 saw arrival of P44 order). With inventory levels (on-hand + in-transit) currently being managed around the target pipeline, I will use a window of the last 22 periods (N=22) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this stable 'lower-high' regime established since Period 27, avoiding the higher-volatility spike period around P16. This provides a balance between high service level (profit=$19) and holding costs ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5977.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 47, with a mean of approximately 268 units and a standard deviation of 45. The most recent demand (P47-P49) has been slightly higher (313, 311, 316), suggesting a possible minor upward drift or simply variance within the current stable regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With only 27 units on-hand and 1214 units in-transit, I need to ensure the parameters effectively utilize the base-stock logic to cover the lead time + review period (L+1). I will use recent_N (N=23, covering the stabilization since P27) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately for the OR backend, allowing it to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.
