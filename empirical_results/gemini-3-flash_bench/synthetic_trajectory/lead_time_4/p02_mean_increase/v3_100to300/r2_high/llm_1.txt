In many inventory systems (L+1), I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (4+1 = 5 periods) to ensure stock-outs are minimized once the first shipment arrives. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must place an order now. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a slightly aggressive stock level is preferred. Calculating target inventory for 5 periods: 100 units/period * 5 periods = 500 units. I will order 500 units to establish the pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 274 units over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), with some fluctuations. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With the game ending in Period 50, orders placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50 (after the Period 50 decision, meaning it satisfies Period 50 demand). Orders placed in Periods 47-50 will not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, Period 46 is the final relevant order period. Current Inventory Position: On-hand (378) + In-transit (610) = 988 units. Expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50): 5 * 274 = 1,370 units. To cover this total expected demand and minimize stockout risk in the final period, the target stock should be roughly 1,370. Current position is 988, suggesting a need for 382 units. However, I have orders scheduled to arrive in P46 (100), P47 (250), P48 (110), and P49 (150). The order placed today arrives in P50. Total inventory available to satisfy P50 demand will be (Starting OH 378 - P46 demand + 100 arriving - P47 demand + 250 arriving - P48 demand + 110 arriving - P49 demand + 150 arriving - P50 demand + P46 order arriving). Summing the arrivals: 378 + 100 + 250 + 110 + 150 = 988. Total demand over periods 46-50 (5 * 274) = 1,370. 1,370 - 988 = 382. To ensure availability in the final phase, I will order 390 units.",

Period 47 (Period_47) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 47 of 50, with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 47) would theoretically arrive at the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 51 (47 + 4). However, customers only buy during Periods 1 through 50. Therefore, orders placed in Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 will not arrive in time to satisfy any demand or contribute to profit; they would only contribute to ending inventory if they arrived, but more importantly, they are unnecessary expenses for this simulation's horizon. The current inventory status is: On-hand = 233. In-transit = 900 units. Looking at the pipeline: Period 43 order (250) arrives P47, Period 44 order (110) arrives P48, Period 45 order (150) arrives P49, and Period 46 order (390) arrives P50. Total expected availability for the remaining 4 periods (47-50) is 233 (on-hand) + 900 (in-transit) = 1133 units. With the current demand regime average being approximately 260-300 units (Recent 5-period avg: 245.6), the total demand for the remaining 4 periods is estimated at ~1100-1200 units. The pipeline is already sufficiently stocked to cover almost all remaining demand without incurring further costs for orders that won't arrive until after the game ends. Thus, the optimal action is to order 0.",

Orders placed now (Period 48) would arrive in the arrival phase of Period 52 (48 + 4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, any order placed in Period 48 is costs capital/resources without the possibility of being sold to generate profit. The pipeline currently consists of orders from P44 (110 units, arriving P48 conclude/P49 start), P45 (150 units, arriving P49 conclude/P50 start), and P46 (390 units, arriving P50 conclude). My current on-hand inventory is 170 units. Total units available to satisfy demand in P48, P49, and P50 are: 170 (on-hand) + 110 (arriving P48) + 150 (arriving P49) = 430 units. The average demand in the current regime (since P18) is ~275 units. I expect to satisfy most demand for P48 and P49, though I will likely stock out in P50. However, since the P47 order (if any, though in this case it was 0) and the P48 order cannot arrive before the game ends, the optimal decision to maximize total reward (Profit * units_sold - HoldingCost * ending_inventory) is to order 0 for all remaining periods to avoid unnecessary holding costs and capital expenditure that won't result in sales.",
