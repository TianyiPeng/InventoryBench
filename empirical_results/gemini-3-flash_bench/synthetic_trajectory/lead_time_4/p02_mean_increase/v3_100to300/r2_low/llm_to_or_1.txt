Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows an average of 100.6 units per period (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio q is 0.5, which implies the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0). Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0. Since this is the first period, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the baseline from the provided history. N=5 covers all available sample data exactly. This will set a base stock level intended to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 147 units, which are currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of 134 units in Period 1 since the arrival occurs after the decision phase and the promised lead time is > 0. Demand for the first five historical samples plus Period 1 (88, 148, 80, 84, 103, 134) averages 106.1. Since it is only Period 2, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand/volatility to capture the most recent patterns, though data is limited. I am setting N=6 to include all available historical samples plus Period 1 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and 300 units are in-transit (147 from Period 1 and 153 from Period 2). Demand for the first two periods was 134 and 79. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals were expected yet in Periods 1 or 2. Based on the 5 provided historical demand samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103), the average demand is 100.6. With L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current inventory (0) + in-transit (300) = 300. Requirement for 5 periods at ~100/period is 500. The OR backend will order to reach the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the available history and 'default' for lead time and sigma, allowing the OR engine to establish the baseline safely while we wait for the first arrival to confirm actual lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 1+4=5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 442 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first 3 periods has averaged 112.33. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, we cannot infer a deviation in lead time. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and forecast demand using all available historical samples (Periods 1-5 provided in the prompt context: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103). The mean demand is 100.6 and the standard deviation is 28.32. The OR engine will use these to calculate the base stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand coverage.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (1 + 4 = 5). We will only see confirmation of this arrival in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. Demand history shows a mean of approximately 100.6 units per period (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). The total pipeline inventory is 525 units, which covers roughly 5 periods of demand. Since we are just reaching the first expected arrival window and have no evidence of lead time deviation or lost shipments yet, I will use 'default' (promised lead time) for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' to incorporate all available samples (N=5) to establish a baseline forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, only the order from Period 1 has arrived (in Period 5), confirming the promised lead time L=4. There are currently 396 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). The average demand over the first 5 periods is approximately 112.2 units (134, 79, 124, 137, 87). However, the historical demand data provided in the prompt (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) differs from the 'conclude' messages. I will prioritize the observed demand from the 'conclude' messages for statistics. Average demand = 112.2, Std Dev \u2248 25. With L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand + in-transit = 60 + 396 = 456. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~561 units. The pipeline is slightly under-supplied if we want to maintain high service levels, but since holding cost equals profit ($1/$1), the backend's critical ratio q = 0.5, meaning it will target the median demand (z=0). I will use recent_N=5 to capture the full observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows that orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly 4 periods later (arrived in P5 and P6 respectively), confirming the lead time is stable at 4. Demand for the last 6 periods has been: 134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102 (including period context provided in headers as 88, 148, 80, 84, 103 for the first 5 samples - reconciling these shows a mean around 106). Since we have no specific calendar dates or product seasonality signals other than 'Regular' chips, I will use all available historical demand samples (N=6 or 'default') to estimate mu and sigma. mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. I'll use the default calculation which appropriately scales the mean and std by the lead time factor.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-157.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (based on arrivals from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arriving in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively). The pipeline inventory (277 units) consists of orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7. The demand has been somewhat inconsistent but shows no clear regime shift yet, with an average around 101 units across the first 7 periods. Given the high parity between profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR backend will calculate. To ensure responsiveness to recent demand variations without over-reacting to the low Period 7 demand (48), I will use the recent 7 periods (all available concluded data) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Current on-hand inventory is 202, with 220 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 99 units per period (samples: 134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102, 48, 86). While demand fluctuates, there is no clear sustained regime shift yet. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead times are stable at the promised value. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (all available post-game-start samples) to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out the noise from the low P7 demand (48).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-128.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P5 arrival from P1, P6 from P2, P7 from P3, P8 from P4, and P9 from P5). Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Current demand (P1-P9) shows significant variability with a mean of ~89.3 and a standard deviation of ~33.8. Recent demand (P7-P9) has been lower (48, 86, 46), averaging ~60. However, the initial samples (P1-P4) were much higher (~118.5). Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) captures the recent deceleration while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the full historical variance, ensuring a robust safety stock given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, implying the base stock will target the median demand). Total pipeline is 279, and on-hand is 174, totaling 453 units, which comfortably covers expected demand over the lead time, but we must maintain the base stock level to account for the 4-period lag.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 7-10) has shifted lower, with an average of approximately 60 units compared to the earlier average of around 110. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat will better reflect this current demand regime. The lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods as promised, so the default method is appropriate. Given the stock on-hand (220) and in-transit (174), totaling 394 units, the current pipeline is sufficient to cover about 6-7 periods of the current demand rate (60/period). The OR backend's base-stock calculation with L=4 will target enough stock for 5 periods (L+1). With demand volatility appearing slightly lower recently, recent_N=4 for sigma_hat is also selected to avoid overstocking due to earlier higher variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg decreased from ~110 to ~60 (-45%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $-65.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift. From Period 1-6, demand averaged ~110 units. From Period 7 onwards, demand has shifted lower, though Period 11 saw a spike to 113. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the mean is approximately 70.4. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 7 consecutive observations (P5-P11). Currently, we have 178 units on-hand and 103 in-transit (orders from P8, P9, and P10). With a promised lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using a recent_N of 5 for demand (mu_hat) captures the current lower demand regime while accounting for the recent spike in P11. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 7. Before P7, the mean demand was ~110. From P7 to P12, the demands have been 48, 86, 46, 59, 113, 68, averaging approximately 71.7 units. This represents a confirmed downward shift. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current regime mean and volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1-P8 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). With on-hand inventory at 136 and in-transit at 148 (77 from P9, 0 from P10, 0 from P11, 71 from P12), the total pipeline is 284. This is sufficient for the immediate (1+L)=5 periods of demand at the new mean (~72 * 5 = 360), so the backend will modulate ordering. The holding cost equals profit, suggesting a service level target (critical ratio) of 0.5; the OR backend will naturally reduce inventory to avoid overstocking while demand is lower.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 7. Before Period 7, demand averaged ~110 units; since Period 7, demand has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, demand from Period 7 to 13 was 48, 86, 46, 59, 113, 68, 118, averaging approximately 78.7 units. This is higher than the previously estimated ~60, suggesting the new mean is closer to 80. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 95 and in-transit at 137 (total 232), and a lead time of 4 (requiring coverage for 5 periods), the current pipeline is slightly lean if demand stays near 80 (80 * 5 = 400). I will use the recent 7 periods (the length of the current regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this shifted demand profile while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). Period 14 concluding showed that the order from Period 10 (which was 0 units) resulted in 0 arrivals, confirming our lead time of 4 periods remains consistent. However, the demand regime has shifted again. While a lower regime was noted around Period 7, the last three periods (P12-P14) have seen demand rise back to levels closer to the initial periods (68, 118, 104; average ~97), compared to the low average of ~60 observed between P7-P11. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent uptick in demand (P12, P13, P14) to better inform the mu_hat for the (L+1) horizon. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as history consistently shows a 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected starting Period 12: average demand increased from ~60 to ~95 (+58%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant rebound. After a dip in Period 7-11, demand surged to 118, 104, and 126 in Periods 13, 14, and 15 respectively, averaging approximately 116 units\u2014consistent with the initial high-demand regime. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals for Period 14 and 15 were 0. This is expected given the promised lead time of 4 periods (orders from P10 and P11 were 0). The next significant arrival is expected in Period 16 (ordered P12, 71 units). With L=4, the base stock must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the recent 4-period rebound (P12-P15), the demand average is around 104. Set \u03bc\u0302 to 520 (104 * 5) and \u03c3\u0302 to 51 (sqrt(5) * ~23) to reflect the recent high-volume volatility and avoid stockouts given the current 0 on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound to initial levels (avg ~110-115) confirmed: Periods 13-15 average 116 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 368 units, which is far above the recent average of ~115. This suggests a potential seasonal event or promotion. Current on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 449 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The demand from P13-P15 averaged around 116 units, but P16's outlier (368) requires caution. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to account for the spike without overreacting excessively, as the OR backend already includes a safety stock calculation. The 4-period window captures the recent rebound and the sudden spike. I am setting L as default (4 periods) as arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 16: demand reached 368 units compared to previous avg of ~115.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand surge that began in Period 16 (368 units) and continued in Period 17 (297 units). This spike is roughly 3 times the previous 'rebound' average of ~115 units. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The current in-transit inventory of 770 units includes the large order of 387 placed last period; however, since that order won't arrive until Period 21, and demand is currently extremely high, there is a risk of missing sales in the intervening periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). To react to this new high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (P15-P17) to capture the trend change immediately. This will increase the base stock calculation to cover the (L+1) horizon at this higher velocity.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: demand surged from ~115 to an average of 332.5 over the last two periods (P16: 368, P17: 297).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a dramatic regime shift starting in Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is approximately 305 units (368, 297, 251), significantly higher than the previous average of ~115. Currently, the system is stockout-constrained with 0 on-hand inventory, despite recent arrivals. The pipeline (1113 units) contains orders placed since Period 15, including significant orders from Period 17 (387) and Period 18 (469). To respond to this shift while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus exclusively on this new high-demand regime. This will raise the base stock level to match the current demand trend (approx. 305 units/period), helping to recover from the stockout. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~305) established: Periods 16-18 consistently show 2x-3x previous demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Over the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been 368, 297, 251, and 177, averaging 273.25 units. While there is a downward trend from the peak of 368, current demand remains significantly higher than the pre-P16 average of approximately 115. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with a large pipeline of 1376 units, most of which were ordered recently to respond to this surge. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility observed since Period 16 (sigma_hat must account for these swings), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the current regime's mean (~273) and high variance to maintain service levels despite the recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high within the new regime; P16-P19 demand variance is significantly higher than previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-volatility, high-demand regime since Period 16. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), the average demand is approximately 289.8 units (368, 297, 251, 177, 356) with significant variance. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 1259 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is approximately 50%, meaning we should aim for the median demand. Using N=5 for mu_hat (the length of the new regime) captures the recent mean of ~290. Using N=5 for sigma_hat captures the significant increase in volatility observed recently. This will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high demand while the existing pipeline works to replenish the stock-out.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~290) confirmed over Periods 16-20 with high volatility (Standard Deviation significantly increased since P16).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from an average of ~115 to approximately 280-300 units per period. The recent demand history (P16-P21) shows values of 368, 297, 251, 177, 356, and 327, averaging 296 units. The most recent demand (P21) of 327 confirms the continuation of this high-demand, high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P17 order in P21. We have a substantial pipeline inventory (1062 units) consisting of orders from P18 (469), P19 (403), and P21 (190). To capture current regime behavior while smoothing out high volatility, I am using a recent_N method with N=6 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), covering the entire duration of the current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 296 unit average rather than the historical 120 unit average.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~296) sustained for 6 periods (P16-P21) with consistently high volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is approximately 293 units (368, 297, 251, 177, 356, 327, 274). The volatility remains significantly higher than the initial phases of the game. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this specific regime's mean and variability. Lead time observations (P18 arrived P22, P17 arrived P21) consistently confirm the promised lead time of 4 periods, so I will continue using 'calculate' for L. The current on-hand inventory (255) and in-transit (951) are being replenished by the large orders placed during the start of the surge, balancing out the risk of stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost (equal to profit).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~293) sustained for 7 periods (P16-P22) with continued high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is firmly established since Period 16. In the last eight periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged approximately 301 units, characterized by significant volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 60). The current on-hand inventory (298) plus the pipeline (807) provides roughly 1105 units. With L=4, the system must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. At an average demand of 301, the expected demand over this window is 1505 units. The current pipeline is insufficient to meet the base stock requirements of this new regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the exact length of the high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrival history from P17-P19 orders arriving consistently with a 4-period lag.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime persists: P16-P23 demand average is 301.25 units with high volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting Period 16. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand is approximately 311.2 units (368, 297, 251, 177, 356, 327, 274, 360, 176), although the variance is significant with periodic dips (like P19 and P24). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P22, P23 arrivals all followed a 4-period lead time). Period 24 saw an arrival of 0 units, but this corresponds to an order of 0 placed in Period 20, so no shipment is actually missing. Current on-hand inventory is 122, with a substantial 1209 units in-transit (orders from P21, P22, P23, P24). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target via the base stock. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime for both mean and volatility, ensuring the pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover the (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P24) average demand is 311.2 units; volatility remains high with standard deviation of ~75 units over this period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the recent 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 311.2 units with a standard deviation of 74.3 units. In Period 25, we experienced a stockout because the arrived shipment (190 units from P21) plus existing inventory (122 units) could not satisfy the demand spike of 394 units. Looking ahead, we must maintain an aggressive base stock to match this high-volume, high-volatility regime. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25). I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current high-demand distribution while smoothing recent fluctuations. Note that Period 24 saw no arrival; however, Period 25 correctly saw the Period 21 arrival (lead_time=4), suggesting the P20 order (which was 0 units) correctly resulted in 0 arrivals in Period 24. No segments of the pipeline appear lost.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P25) average demand is 311.2 units; volatility remains high with standard deviation of ~74 units over this 10-period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues. Over the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the average demand is 311.1 units with a standard deviation of 72.8. In the most recent period (P26), demand was 242, which remains within the high-volatility bounds of this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25, P22 arrived P26). However, the order from Period 20 (ordered 0) is logically ignored, and the order from Period 23 is currently in-transit and should arrive in P27. The current on-hand inventory is 116. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1.0), the backend's default target service level is 50%. Setting N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entirety of this high-demand, high-volatility regime to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current market behavior while smoothing out recent fluctuations.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 27, the average demand is approximately 300.7 units (368, 297, 251, 177, 356, 327, 274, 360, 176, 394, 242, 363). The volatility in this regime is significant, with a standard deviation of approximately 74 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current period is 28, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this 12-period high-demand regime (P16-P27). This helps the OR backend establish a base stock level that accounts for the high mean and high variance, ensuring a sufficient service level while managing holding costs as demand fluctuates around the 300-unit mark. I will use 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P27) consolidated: 12-period average demand is 300.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 74 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 28 (13 data points), the average demand is approximately 303 units per period. The standard deviation during this same window is approximately 71 units, reflecting high volatility compared to the early game but relative consistency within this specific regime. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods as evidenced by the consistent 'lead_time was 4 periods' messages in the concluding reports (e.g., P28 conclude shows the P24 order arriving, exactly 4 periods later). Since the profit and holding cost are both $1.0/unit, the critical ratio q = 0.5, which implies a target base stock at the median of the demand distribution (z* = 0). For my parameters, I am using recent_N with N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime while excluding the earlier low-demand periods. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed reality.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 305 units per period and significant volatility (std dev ~74). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P22-P25. Period 29 ended with zero on-hand inventory due to high demand (321) exceeding the available stock (189). With 1318 units in-transit and a target base stock based on a High-Demand/High-Volatility regime (L+1 = 5 periods), the backend needs to maintain coverage for approximately 1525 units (305 * 5). I am using 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime from Period 16 to 29, ensuring the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current volume and variance accurately to minimize stockouts in this high-frequency sales environment.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues. Using the last 15 periods (P16 to P30), the average demand is approximately 298.6 units. While recent demand has fluctuated (P29: 321, P30: 229), the overall regime is stable with a 15-period mean near 300. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (136) relative to average demand, but 'In-transit' is substantial (1149). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this sustained high-demand regime and its associated high volatility, which ensures the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock level for a 5-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime consolidated (Period 16-30): average demand ~299 units. Volatility remains high but stable within this regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 31 (16 samples), the mean demand is approximately 298.6 units with a standard deviation of 71.9. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by the recent arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31 (31 - 27 = 4). Current on-hand inventory is 118, and in-transit is 1136. The pipeline (1254) is sufficient compared to the expected demand over the lead-time window (L+1 = 5 periods * ~300 = 1500), but given the high volatility and stockout risk (stockouts occurred in P25 and P29), I will continue using the high-regime statistics (N=16) to parameterize the OR engine to maintain service levels. Setting N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current regime's behavior precisely.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began at Period 16 remains consistent and stable. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 32 (17 samples), the average demand is approximately 300.2 units with a standard deviation of 63.8 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 216 units, and there are 960 units in transit (ordered in P29, P30, P31, P32). Using the recent_N method with N=17 captures this specific high-demand regime's mean and volatility while excluding the lower-demand history prior to Period 16. This should maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover demand during the lead time and the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for the observed high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16 to 33), the average demand is approximately 296 units per period. The standard deviation within this high-demand window remains significant, calculated at approximately 65 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 28 and 29 orders exactly 4 periods later. The Current On-hand (274) plus In-transit (910) totals 1184 units. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the regime mean of ~296, expected demand over 5 periods is ~1480. Therefore, the pipeline is slightly lean. I will set L to 'calculate' to leverage the historical stability of the 4-period lead time, and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the start of the regime at Period 16 to the most recent Period 33) to capture the current mean and volatility correctly.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Periods 16-33) remains stable with an average of ~296 units and standard deviation of ~65 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 296 units per period with significant volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P16, the mean demand is around 295, and the standard deviation is approximately 65. Using the last 19 periods (P16-P34) provides the most accurate representation of the current regime's statistics. Setting N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this behavior. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus one period (L+1=5), targeting a service level determined by the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), which results in a critical ratio of 0.5. However, the capped policy ensures we don't over-order. Current inventory is 285 on-hand with 997 in-transit, which aligns closely with the pipeline requirements for this high-demand scenario.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 16 continues to be stable. Over the last 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is 294.6 units. Lead time remain stable at 4 periods, which combined with the next period's demand (L+1), requires covering 5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand (179) and In-transit (950) total 1,129 units. Given the high volatility (Std Dev ~66 over the regime), I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime's mean and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the sustained higher volume and volatility seen since Period 16 while avoiding the noise of earlier low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime for chips(Regular) starting at Period 16 remains stable through Period 36. The average demand across this entire regime window (P16-P36) is approximately 294 units. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P32-P36) has averaged 272.4 units, slightly lower but within the typical volatility of this regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate, as the arrival in Period 36 was from the Period 32 order (36-32=4). The on-hand inventory is 138 with a large in-transit pipeline of 1049. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime's mean and standard deviation while filtering out the early low-demand history and the extreme initial spike of P16. This provides a stable basis for the OR backend to calculate the base stock and order amount to cover the (L+1) period horizon while managing holding costs.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 16 continues to be stable. Since Period 16, the average demand has been approximately 296 units with a standard deviation around 65. The most recent demand (Period 37) was 307, alignining with this regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order exactly 4 periods later in Period 37. On-hand inventory is 125, and in-transit inventory is 985. Since there are no new shifts or missing shipments, I will use a 20-period lookback (from Period 17 to 37) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the stable behavior of this high-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the initial transition. This ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock to cover demand across the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues to be stable. Since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 296 units with a standard deviation of 64. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=23 to capture the entire duration of this high-demand regime (Periods 16-38) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this provides the most robust estimate for the current sustained pattern while ignoring earlier low-demand phases. On-hand inventory is at 81, and a significant pipeline (1011 units) is in transit, which the lead-time-aware OR policy will account for when placing the order for Period 39.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Periods 16-38) remains stable with an average of ~296 units and standard deviation of ~64 units over the last 23 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $238.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, averaging approximately 296 units with a standard deviation of 64. Period 39 ended with zero on-hand inventory because the arrival from Period 35 (157 units) plus the carryover was insufficient to meet the 299 demand. However, there are 1212 units in transit, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current average rate. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use the recent_N method based on the 24-period high-demand regime (Periods 16-39) to inform the OR backend. Using N=24 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the full behavior of this regime, including its significant variance, while L=4 (default) remains appropriate as arrivals are punctual.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 296 units and a consistent lead time of 4 periods. In the most recent periods (P36-P40), demand has shown some volatility (averaging ~266 over the last 5 periods), but remains within the structural expectation of the high-regime. Period 40 saw a slightly lower demand of 199. The in-transit pipeline is currently 1137 units, which is roughly 4 periods of demand at the regime average, plus the current on-hand inventory of 116. I am using recent_N=25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full stability of the current high-demand regime (starting from Period 16) while filtering out the noise from the earlier low-demand periods. L is set to calculate as lead times have been consistently 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 296 units and a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Recently, demand has fluctuated (P39: 299, P40: 199, P41: 286), but remains within the expected parameters of this regime. Current on-hand inventory is 60 with a significant in-transit pipeline of 1087 units (orders from P38-P41). These orders are expected to arrive in Periods 42-45. To maintain the service level across the remaining 9 periods while accounting for the high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 64) and the lead time (L=4), I am using a recent_N approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focused on the current stable regime (N=26, covers P16 to P41). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the recent 27 periods (P16-P42), the average demand is approximately 287 units with a standard deviation of about 64 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38 in their respective expected periods. Although on-hand inventory is currently low (138), the in-transit pipeline (1064 units) is robust, consisting of orders placed in Periods 39, 40, 41, and 42. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be near the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the characteristics of this stable high-demand regime while excluding much older data. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been highly reliable.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 295-300 units per period. Recently, the demand has shown a slight softening (P40-P43 average: 232.75) compared to the long-term average of the regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 281 and in-transit at 912, the pipeline is well-stocked relative to the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=28 (covering the start of the heavy demand regime at P16) to capture the overall regime behavior while acknowledging the high volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=28 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the significant variability observed since the regime shift. This approach maintains a high service level while the OR backend's inventory cap logic prevents excessive over-ordering during the current slight demand dip.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues to be the dominant pattern. Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the average demand is approximately 266 units with a standard deviation of roughly 43 units. While slightly lower than the initial surge average (~300), it remains statistically distinct from the pre-P16 levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P40's order in P44. Current on-hand inventory is 274, with 890 units in transit (covering orders from P41 to P44), which is sufficient given the 4-period lead time. I will use a 10-period window (N=10) for demand and 5 periods for lead time to capture the most recent stable phase of this high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current volatility and mean accurately for the OR backend's service level calculation.

Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the average demand is approximately 258 units, which is a slight softening from the long-term regime average of ~296 units but remains within a consistent range. Volatility has stabilized but remains significant. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 164 and in-transit at 885, total pipeline inventory is 1049. Given a review period plus lead time of 5 periods (L=4), 1049 units cover an average demand of ~210 units per period. Since recent demand is closer to 260, the OR backend needs to maintain a robust order flow. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slightly lower demand seen in the most recent periods while maintaining a recent_N of 20 for sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock against historical volatility within this high-demand regime. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the high-demand regime established around Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 296 units and significant volatility. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has slightly softened (avg ~255), but given the high standard deviation (~65) and the objective to maximize service level (profit vs holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% critical ratio, but the back-end uses a base-stock policy), I will maintain parameters aligned with the established regime to avoid stockouts. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is full (879 units in-transit) and on-hand inventory is healthy (205). I'll use recent_N (N=31, covering the high-demand regime from P16-P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime's characteristics while smoothing out short-term fluctuations observed in the last 4-5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $215.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues within the high-demand regime established at Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), the average demand is 265.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 42 units. This is slightly lower than the initial surge levels (~300) but remains significantly elevated compared to early periods. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P40-P43 all arrived exactly in 4 periods). With the game ending at Period 50, we must cover demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). Using a 'recent_N' of 10 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the most recent stability within this high-demand regime. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on (1+L) * 265.4, which is sufficient to cover the remaining lead time plus review period, while the cap will prevent over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P38-P47) slightly moderated but stable: 10-period average is 265.4 units with reduced volatility (Std Dev ~42) compared to the initial P16 surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the game. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, the demand has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, though it moderated slightly around Period 38. The last 10 periods (P39-P48) show an average demand of 263.6 units with a standard deviation of 41.5 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods and the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (orders from P44 were received in P48). I have 5 units on hand and 1010 units in transit. Given the lead time is 4, an order placed today (P49) would arrive in P53, which is beyond the game's end at P50. Therefore, current inventory + pipeline (1015 units) is more than sufficient to cover the remaining two periods (P49 and P50) even at the most aggressive historical demand levels (~300-400 per period). To maximize total reward, I must minimize ending inventory to avoid holding costs, while ensuring demand for the last few periods is met. Setting L to the promised 4 and using the most recent 10-period demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat will result in a base stock level that, when compared against the massive pipeline of 1010, will lead the OR backend to order 0. This is the correct strategy for the end of the game when pipeline substantially exceeds remaining lifetime demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit/holding ratio of 1.0, suggesting a target service level of 50%. The demand remains in the established high-demand regime, with the last 12 periods (P38-P49) showing an average of 267.4 units. While there was a slight moderation in volume compared to the P16-P30 surge, volatility remains significant (Std Dev ~41.5 over the last 10 periods). The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 1138 units in-transit, which covers more than 4 periods of the current average demand (267 * 4 = 1068). To maintain a 50% service level while accounting for the recent moderation in both mean and variance, I am using recent_N=12 for mu_hat and recent_N=12 for sigma_hat to capture the current stable-but-moderate regime without being overly influenced by the older, more extreme spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P38-P49) has stabilized at a slightly lower average (267.4 units) and lower volatility (Std Dev ~41) compared to the initial surge period.
