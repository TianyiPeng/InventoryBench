Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no historical data yet, I will use the baseline statistics calculated from the provided demand samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). The mean demand across these 5 samples is 100.6 units per period, and the standard deviation is approximately 28.5. Given a promised lead time (L) of 4, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'default' methods will allow the backend to use all available samples to establish an initial base stock. I will monitor for lead-time confirmation starting in Period 6 (P1 order + 4 lead time + 1 period observation delay).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 147 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), resulting in 0 sales for Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the 5 provided samples (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) averages approximately 100.6 units per period. Since we are in the very early stages of the game and have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (using the provided historical samples) to establish a baseline forecast. This approach ensures the OR backend attempts to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Currently, 295 units are in-transit (147 from P1, 148 from P2). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for P1 and P2 was 99 and 100 respectively. Since L=4, we do not expect P1's order until P5 conclude (visible at the start of P6). Historical demand samples provided (P1-P5) show mean demand around 100.6 (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). Using these 5 samples as a base, the mean is ~101. Lead time L=4 means we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (the provided historical samples) to capture the base demand level of roughly 101 per period. Since L=4 is promised and we have no arrivals yet to contradict it, L=default is appropriate.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (147 units), Period 2 (148 units), and Period 3 (111 units) are currently in-transit and have not arrived yet, which is expected given the lead time. Total In-transit is 406. Demand has been extremely stable (99, 100, 99) with an average of 99.33. Stockouts have occurred because start-of-game inventory was 0 and arrivals haven't started. Based on the 5 pre-game samples (avg 100.6) and the 3 game periods (avg 99.33), the demand regime is consistent around 100 units. I will set L to the promised 4 periods. mu_hat is calculated for (1+L)=5 periods of demand (5 * 100 = 500). sigma_hat is set to cover historical volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (arrival resolution phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced lost sales for 4 consecutive periods due to the lead time gap. The total in-transit quantity is 541 units (147+148+111+135). Historical demand has been very stable, with samples: 99, 100, 99, 104 (mean \u2248 100.5, std \u2248 2.4). Since the lead time has not yet been confirmed by a 'conclude' message, I will stick with the promised L=4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable demand for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $303.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the conclusion of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since the inventory arriving in Period 5 (147 units) was immediately used to satisfy Period 5 demand (leaving 57 units), current on-hand units are low. Total in-transit is 394 (orders from P2, P3, P4). Mean demand over the first 5 periods is 98.4 ((99+100+99+104+90)/5). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. mu_hat should ideally reflect this 5-period window (~492 units). I will use the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat as the demand is stable and all 5 samples are relevant. I will use the default for L as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Demand is stable around 100 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have confirmed the lead time (L) is 4 periods based on orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The system operates on a base-stock policy where we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable, with the last 6 periods showing values: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103 (from user data) and the conclude messages showing 99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131. The mean demand is approximately 102 units/period. With L=4, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is roughly 510 units. Total pipeline inventory (on-hand 74 + in-transit 329) is 403 units, which is slightly below the required base stock. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to lock in the observed lead time, 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent stable demand regime (averaging approx 102), and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on full historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders in P1, P2, and P3). Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period, despite some variance (lowest 71, highest 131). The pipeline is healthy with 356 units in-transit and 114 on-hand. Since the lead time is steady and demand has not shown a sustained regime shift, I will use 'calculate' for the lead time and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical sample (7 periods of actual demand data) to balance service levels with holding costs. The base stock level needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with an average of approximately 100 units per period (Periods 1-8 mean = 101.4). In Period 6, it was confirmed that the actual lead time is 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 291) consists of orders from Periods 6, 7, and 8, which are expected to arrive in Periods 10, 11, and 12 respectively. No order was placed in Period 5, which explains the future gap in Period 9 arrivals (already reflected in the current on-hand of 142). I will set the parameters using the full history of 8 samples (N=8) to capture the base demand level and volatility accurately, maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $413.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the delivery for the order placed in Period 5 (which was 0 units) correctly resulted in 0 arrivals in Period 9, following the documented lead time of 4 periods. The next arrival (from Period 6 order of 83 units) is expected in Period 10 (visible in Period 11). Current on-hand is 31 units, while pipeline inventory is 391 units. Since Period 5, demand has slightly fluctuated but remains centered around the historical mean. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slight uptick in the last two periods (107, 111) while maintaining the proven lead time of 4 periods. This setting helps the OR backend ensure that current inventory plus in-transit covers the next 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 10 (131) exceeded starting inventory (114). The order from Period 5 (which was for 0 units) resulted in no arrivals during Period 9, causing the stockout risk realized in Period 10. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 10 with the arrival of the Period 6 order). Mean demand remains stable with some variance. Historically, demand across the first 10 periods averages 104.7. To recover from the stockout and cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1=5), I am using a recent_N approach for demand estimation. Setting N=5 for demand (averaging Periods 6-10) gives context to the recent slight upward trend in variance.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around 100 units/period (mean of all samples \u2248103). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 10, an arrival was missing (the order from Period 5, which was 0 units), resulting in temporary stockout risks which were mitigated in Period 11 by the arrival of 138 units. The current state (Period 12 decision) shows on-hand inventory of 39 and in-transit of 452 (Orders from P8, P9, P10, P11). I will maintain the base stock parameters for a stable regime by using all available demand history and sticking with the observed lead time of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' is consistently averaging around 105 units per period based on the last 12 periods of data (Total demand: 1254). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by the arrival history (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12). However, a shipment gap occurred in Period 9 (no arrival from Period 5), though no order was placed in Period 5, which explains that gap. Currently, On-hand is 0, and there is a significant amount In-transit (443 units). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4/1), the target service level is approximately 80%. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable mean of ~105 and 'default' for lead time and sigma to maintain standard safety stock buffers.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean around 104 units and a standard deviation of approximately 14 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13. We are currently facing stockouts (On-hand: 0) because demand in Periods 10, 12, and 13 exceeded the stock arriving from previous cycles. However, there are 460 units in-transit (from orders in P10, P11, P12, and P13), which should align with future demand. To stabilize the inventory and account for recent volatility that caused stockouts, I will use recent_N=8 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slightly elevated average demand (approx 103 units/period) and for sigma_hat to capture the actual observed variance. Setting L to default (promised 4) is appropriate as the system is behaving according to the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $509.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a slight upward trend in recent periods (averaging approximately 110-120 units). The lead time of 4 periods is well-established by consistently observing arrivals 4 periods after ordering (e.g., P10 order arrived P14). I will use the last 5 periods of demand to capture the recent slight increase in consumption (averaging ~113 units) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This results in setting mu_hat for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, warranting a healthy safety stock. Currently, on-hand is low (3 units) but in-transit (452 units) corresponds to approximately 4 periods of future demand, which aligns with the lead time. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the policy adapts to the slightly higher variance and mean observed between Period 10 and 14.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed around Period 10: mean demand has increased from ~100 to ~115 units (+15%).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 10, averaging approximately 114.5 units per period over the last 6 periods (P10-P15). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 50 units with 440 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4) and the review period (1), we need to cover demand for the next 5 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 captures the current regime's mean better than the long-term average. Standard deviation (sigma_hat) is also calculated based on the last 6 periods to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will use these values to maintain a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (aiming for an ~80% service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, a massive demand spike (280 units) was observed, significantly exceeding the previous regime mean (~115). This suggests a potential seasonal peak or a new high-demand regime. However, in Period 16, we only captured 111 sales due to stockouts, leaving 169 units of unmet demand. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To recover from this stockout and prepare for potentially sustained high demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat to incorporate the recent demand shift while weighting the spike. Leading up to this, L has been consistent at 4 periods. The goal is to set a high base stock to capture these spikes while acknowledging the current pipeline and the risk of holding costs if the spike was a one-off.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 16 (280 units), indicating potential seasonality or a new high-demand regime (+140% from previous mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand indicates a significant regime shift: Period 16 (280) and Period 17 (289) show demand more than doubling from the previous mean of ~115. This suggests a seasonal peak or a long-term shift. I have 0 on-hand inventory and 612 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4), the inventory arriving in the coming periods was based on the old demand regime (orders from P14-P17), meaning we are likely to face stockouts if this high demand persists. I will set mu_hat explicitly to reflect this new demand level of ~285 units per period. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. 285 * 5 = 1425. sigma_hat is also increased to reflect higher volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 16: demand jumped from ~115 to ~285 (+148%) and has sustained for 2 periods. Monitoring for further increases or a return to mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we saw the third consecutive Demand sample near 280-290 (280, 289, 280), confirming a definitive regime shift from the previous average of ~115 to a new high of approximately 283 units per period. This shift started at Period 16. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant lost sales recently, we must recalibrate our OR parameters to this new regime. Mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand at the new rate, which is approximately 5 * 283 = 1415. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat targets this specific high-demand window (Periods 16, 17, and 18). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period fulfillment cycle. This aggressive adjustment will help the OR backend increase order quantities to meet the new demand level and minimize stockouts.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, increasing from ~115 to ~280 units/period. The last four periods (P16-P19) show remarkably consistent high demand (280, 289, 280, 264), establishing a new mean of approximately 278 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the system calculates base stock as (1+L)*mean, and L=4, my forecast must support total demand over a 5-period horizon. Current on-hand is 0, and we have significant pipeline stock from recent high-volume orders placed in P17-P19. I am using recent_N=4 to capture this latest sustained high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet this new baseline while reflecting the increased volatility associated with the higher volume.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. After Period 10, demand stabilized around 115, but from Period 16 onwards, it experienced a massive spike to a mean of approximately 287 (samples: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322). The last 5 periods (P16-P20) show a clear new regime with higher mean and increased volatility. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this newest regime. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (P20 arrival was ordered P16). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have been stock-out for several periods due to the sudden jump in demand, so we must aggressive target the new base stock levels. mu_hat is calculated for (1+L) = 5 periods based on the recent average of ~287, and sigma_hat is updated to reflect the higher variance in this spike period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean demand increased from ~115 to ~287 (+150%) with higher volatility (observed over 5 periods).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Mean demand transitioned from approximately 115 units to 287 units (+150%). The last six periods of demand are: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203. Although Period 21 saw a slight cooling (203), the overall trend remains significantly higher than the previous baseline. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the Period 17 order arriving in Period 21). We have a large pipeline in-transit (1233 units), but given the stockouts in periods 16-20, we must ensure our parameters reflect the new demand level to maintain a high service level. I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime characteristics starting from Period 16. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~115 units to ~282 units (average of Periods 16-22). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival from Period 18 in Period 22. Current on-hand inventory is 100 units, and the pipeline is substantial (1004 units). Given the high critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8), the OR backend needs to maintain a service level around 80%. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture only the new high-demand regime (Periods 16-22). This ensures parameters reflect the current mean (~282) and the significantly increased volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to utilize the stable 4-period historical average. These settings will allow the OR controller to appropriately size the base stock to meet this new demand level while considering the existing large pipeline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting in Period 16. In the last 8 periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged approximately 282 units (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336, 282), compared to the earlier mean of ~115. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 23. To capture the current high-demand environment while accounting for the recent spike in volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to focus on this current regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the increased variance observed during this period, ensuring the service level account for both the higher mean and the higher uncertainty. Pipeline inventory is currently high (1065 units) following aggressive ordering to catch up with the surge; setting these parameters will allow the OR backend to appropriately manage the stock levels relative to this new demand plateau.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~115 to approximately 285-290 units per period. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand is 285.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 35.8. Leading into Period 25, the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current demand pattern has stabilized over the last 9 periods, I will use recent_N with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the new high-demand regime (+150% increase from the initial state) while ignoring the outdated lower-demand historical data. The backend will use these parameters to set a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1360.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~115 to approximately 297 units over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). Recent volatility has also increased, with demand ranging from 203 to 375. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 21 order in Period 25. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a demand spike (375) exceeding available stock. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out the pre-shift data. Setting L to 4 reflects the consistent observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained: last 10 periods average ~297 units (vs ~115 prior), showing significant and continued high demand.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~115 units to approximately 297 units per period. The last 11 periods (P16-P26) have an average demand of 292.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 48.7. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current inventory on-hand is 0, with 1366 units in transit. Since the new demand regime has been sustained for 11 periods, I will use recent_N with N=11 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this higher demand and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the approximately 1460 units of expected demand and sufficient safety stock to handle the increased variance.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~115 to approximately 300 units per period. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 292.5. Current on-hand inventory is 55, and in-transit inventory is 1187, which covers about 4 periods of demand at the new rate. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime has been sustained for 12 periods, I am using recent_N (N=12) to capture the higher mean and volatility of this specific period. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased demand level (L+1 = 5 periods) and the higher standard deviation observed during this high-demand phase, maximizing the service level while managing holding costs.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16 and has remained elevated. Over the last 13 periods (P16-P28), the mean demand is approximately 294 units, compared to the earlier ~115 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using a recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=13 to capture this sustained high-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the earlier, lower-demand periods. This ensures the base stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) is properly scaled for the current market conditions. Current on-hand is low (36), but significant inventory (1173) is in transit to cover the lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $918.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 29, the average demand is approximately 293 units per period (mean of 280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336, 282, 315, 375, 251, 298, 330, 257). The volatility (standard deviation) in this regime is roughly 44 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all recent arrivals. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 110, In-transit: 1186) are being managed based on this new baseline. I will use a 14-period window (recent_N=14) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this specific regime perfectly while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. For lead time (L), the promised value of 4 is accurate and stable, so 'default' is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $824.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a new high-demand regime that started around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 30, the mean demand is approximately 293 units with a standard deviation of about 44 units. This is significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 average. The lead time has remained very consistent at 4 periods. Since this regime has been sustained for 15 periods (from P16 to P30), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this specific demand behavior. I'll maintain L as 'calculate' since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4 periods consistently. This setting allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the (L+1) horizon based on the most recent relevant data, ensuring high service levels during this high-demand period while accounting for its increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1186.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~115 to approximately 300 units per period. This high-demand regime has now been sustained for 16 periods (P16-P31). Analyzing the last 10 periods (P22-P31), the average demand is 298.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 39.5 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P23 to P27 consistently showing a 4-period duration. Current on-hand inventory is 78 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 1133 units. To account for the current high-demand regime and its volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the most stable portion of the recent shift. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the ~300 unit level, adjusting the order to maintain stock levels against the ~$4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~115 to approximately 300 units per period. Evaluating the last 17 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is 295.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 49.3. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 32 (388) exceeded available stock (375). Total in-transit inventory is 1204 units (covering orders from periods 29, 30, 31, and 32), which aligns with roughly 4 periods of the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime while ensuring the inventory target accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5 periods).

The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained high. Mean demand from Period 16 to 33 is approximately 297.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 47 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P29 order arrived in P33). Current on-hand inventory is 43 units, with a pipeline of 1228 units. To ensure the high demand is captured while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the entire high-demand regime from Period 16 onwards (33-16+1 = 18).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the last 19 periods (P16-P34), the average demand is approximately 296 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 48. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 1284 units in transit (orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34 are expected in P35, P36, P37, and P38 respectively). The goal is to maintain a base stock level that covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. Given the stable but volatile high demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=19) to capture the current regime's mean and variance, which will allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock level and determine the Period 35 order while considering the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: High-demand regime (starting P16) continues to be stable at ~296 units/period with standard deviation ~48 (calculated over 19 periods). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift at Period 16, increasing from ~115 units to a stable mean of approximately 296 units. Recent demand samples (Periods 16-35) confirm this higher mean with a standard deviation of about 48. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to slightly higher than anticipated demand in the most recent periods, but the pipeline (in-transit) is substantial enough to cover the lead time. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in recent 'conclude' messages. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime statistics since its onset at P16. This allows the backend to calculate the base stock level (approximately equivalent to 1480 units) to maintain the required service level against the current demand profile while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 is sustained and stable. Over the last 21 periods (P16-P36), the mean demand is approximately 296 units with a standard deviation of approximately 48 units. The promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent with observations, where orders arrive precisely 4 periods later. The recent demand (Period 36: 345 units) is consistent with this high-demand regime. To align the OR backend with this sustained pattern, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=21 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the entire duration of the current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation (1+L)*demand_mean accounts for the current 296-unit average, while the sigma captures the observed volatility in this period. Pipeline inventory (1192) plus on-hand (23) is roughly covering the next 4 periods of demand, keeping the system balanced near the target service level.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and remains stable. Over the last 22 periods (P16-P37), the average demand is approximately 296 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 41. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals from orders in P30, P31, P32, and P33 in the recent game history). I will use the recent_N method based on the last 22 periods (the duration of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand and volatility accurately. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been extremely stable at the promised value of 4.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a high-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 296 units per period. In the last 5 periods (P35-P39), demand has been 273, 345, 262, 230, and 265, which averages to 275 units, slightly lower than the long-term regime average but within normal volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, verified by \u2018conclude\u2019 messages (e.g., P35 order arrived at P39). On-hand inventory is healthy at 217 units, and the pipeline (1070 units) is well-distributed to cover the next 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the stable regime's mean (N=24, since P16) and sigma_hat based on recent variability. The backend will calculate base stock as (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std, effectively targeting a high service level due to the substantial $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 296 units per period. In the most recent 10 periods (P31-P40), the mean demand is 280.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 50 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P36's order in P40. Current inventory consists of 230 units on-hand and 1087 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy with a review period of 1 and a lead time of 4, meaning the target inventory must cover 5 periods (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=25 (covering the regime from P16 onwards) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while filtering out older low-demand data. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 296 units per period. Evaluating the last 26 periods (P16-P41), the mean demand is 287.8 with a standard deviation of 45.4. Recent demand in Period 41 (328 units) is slightly above this mean but within the expected volatility range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 260 and in-transit at 946 (totaling 1206 units), and an expected demand across the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5) of approximately 1440 units, the system needs to maintain sufficient stock to cover this window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=26 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock levels reflect the higher volume and increased variability observed since the regime shift.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 27 periods (P16 to P42), the average demand is approximately 287 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 48. Lead times are consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 233 units and there is a healthy pipeline of 1027 units. To optimize for the profit/holding cost ratio (Profit $4, Holding $1; q = 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=27 to capture the characteristics of the current demand regime. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 287 units and a standard deviation of about 46. Recent periods (P39-P43) show demand values of 265, 228, 328, 280, and 304, maintaining this average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P43 conclusion showing the P39 order arriving on time). The pipeline inventory is healthy at 1086 units, and on-hand inventory is 147 units. Given the game is approaching its end (Period 44 of 50), I will maintain the current regime parameters to ensure high service levels while managing holding costs. I am using recent_N with N=20 to capture the statistics of the high-demand regime that began in Period 16.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 296 units and a standard deviation of about 48 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 119, In-transit: 1154) are being managed to meet this sustained demand. Since the regime has been stable for 29 periods, I am using a recent_N of 20 to capture the current mean and variance accurately for the OR backend, ensuring a robust base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5). This approach balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost by maintaining an appropriate service level.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a high-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 287 units per period. The last 10 periods (P36-P45) show a mean of 280 units and a standard deviation of approximately 36 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 65 units, and in-transit inventory is 1216 units (covering orders from P42-P45). With 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), and a lead time of 4, the order placed in P46 will arrive in P50, which is the final period. Orders placed after P46 will not arrive in time to be sold. Therefore, P46 is the last effective ordering period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest demand levels to minimize stockouts in the final stretch, while the OR backend's inventory balancing will account for the large pipeline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 remains stable, with current mean demand over the last 30 periods (P17-P46) at approximately 283 units and a standard deviation of 42. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 283 units (std 30), further confirming this stability. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 114 and in-transit at 1072, the pipeline is well-stocked for the target window (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=30 to capture the full scope of the current regime while filtering out the noise from the earlier, lower-demand period. This ensures \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are tuned to the higher volume and volatility of the current state, optimizing the service level against holding costs for the final periods.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1164.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 285-300 units per period. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), the average demand is 286.8 units with a standard deviation of 30.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by arrivals in the history (e.g., P43 order arrived in P47). Inventory management is currently well-balanced, with an ending inventory of 80 units. To maintain this balance and ensure high service levels (critical since profit is 4x the holding cost), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) of this regime. This period (P48) is close to the game end (P50), so maintaining a consistent policy based on recent performance is optimal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $734.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 285-300 units per period. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the mean demand is 278.6 units with a standard deviation of 30.7. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrival messages (e.g., Period 48 conclude showing arrival from Period 44). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) with an appropriate safety stock for the observed volatility. With 178 units on-hand and 1049 units in-transit (covering orders from P45, P46, P47, P48), the pipeline is well-stocked for the final period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 287 units over the last 34 periods. The most recent 10 periods (P40-P49) show a mean of 280.3 units and a standard deviation of 30.6. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 176 and 1048 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 46, 47, 48, 49), the system is well-positioned to meet upcoming demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable high-demand regime while filtering out minor fluctuations, and the 'calculate' method for lead time (L) as it has been perfectly consistent at 4 periods throughout the history.
