Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the first five demand points are provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), we need to set expectations based on this initial sample. The mean of these five points is 91 and the standard deviation is approximately 31.02. To ensure we provide enough stock to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current review period (1+L=5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I'll use the 'default' promised value of 4 as no history exists to suggest otherwise.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 143 units was placed for 'chips(Regular)'. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect this to arrive until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 143 in-transit. Demand in P1 was 83, and history shows samples: P1:105, P2:36, P3:108, P4:110, P5:96. Note: The 'Game History' demand for P1 is listed as 83, while 'Historical Demand Data' says 105. I will rely on the provided 5-sample history for the forecast. The average demand across these 5 points is ~91. With a lead time (L) of 4, the demand window is (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 91 = 455. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using all 5 available historical samples to establish a baseline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (143 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 arrival phase. Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales as demand was 83 and 125 respectively. Total in-transit is 280 (143 from P1 + 137 from P2). Historical demand samples are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96], while actual observed demand in the game so far is [83, 125]. The average demand across all 7 available data points is approximately 94.7. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the mean of 95, mu_hat should be around 475. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical and game data, as no clear regime shift is yet confirmed.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5. Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived=0' appears in the concludes for Periods 1, 2, and 3. We have currently zero on-hand inventory and 423 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand in the first three periods was 83, 125, and 107 (average ~105). Since the lead time is 4, we must cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean of the first 5 historical samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), the average demand is 91. However, the game history for P1-P3 shows slightly different realized demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (4) and'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the backend to use all available historical data (the 5 samples provided plus the 3 realized periods) to calculate the base stock, as no significant regime shift or lead-time deviation is yet visible.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-4 are still in transit. Specifically, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, which has led to 100% lost sales over the first 4 periods. Total in-transit is 533 units. Historical demand across Periods 1-4 is 83, 125, 107, and 86 (mean=100.25). The most recent demand (Period 4) was 86. Given the promised lead time of 4, the OR backend needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the stabilization after the initial fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current demand samples [105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 83, 125, 107, 86, 55] show some volatility but no clear structural shift (mean ~91). Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Current on-hand (88) and in-transit (396) total 484. Average demand over 5 periods is roughly 455. The OR backend will calculate the optimal base stock using the statistics. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations, and 'default' for lead time and sigma as they align with observations so far.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods based on Period 1 order arriving in Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $350.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 110, with 281 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). Expected arrivals: P3 order (143) in P7, P4 order (110) in P8, P5 order (6) in P9, and P6 order (22) in P10. Total pipeline is 281. Historical demand for the first 6 periods is [83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115]. The mean demand is approximately 95, and the standard deviation is approximately 25. There is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (the full available history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variability while staying responsive to the established mean. The backend will calculate base_stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Demand volatility is moderate, so using recent statistics will help balance holding costs against potential stockouts.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P3-P7) shows values of 107, 86, 55, 115, and 110 (avg ~94.6). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in P1, P2, and P3, all arriving with a lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is 143, and there are 271 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). The total pipeline plus on-hand (414) is well-positioned to cover approximately 4 periods of demand (avg 94.6 * 4 = 378.4) plus a safety buffer. Given that the demand mean appears stable and the lead time is consistent with the promise, I will use 'calculate' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations while smoothing out the dip seen in P5.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by deliveries in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 92.1 units per period. In the last 4 periods (P5-P8), the mean has slightly decreased to 84 units, but variance remains moderately high (std dev ~31). Given that we have 197 units on-hand and 267 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 464), and our target base stock for (L+1=5) periods at a mean of ~92 is approximately 460-500 units, we are currently well-positioned. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (all available data from the start of the game) to stabilize the forecast and account for the initial demand volatility while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in arrivals for Periods 5 through 9). The promised lead time of 4 is reliable. Demand for the first 9 periods has been: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56, 104. The overall mean is 93.4 and standard deviation is approximately 23.5. There is no clear shift in demand regime yet; demand fluctuates between ~55 and ~125. The current on-hand inventory is 99 and in-transit is 308 (orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). With a lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 407. Expected demand over 5 periods is 5 * 93.4 = 467. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), leading to a critical ratio of 0.8. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as it matches the observed data, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical sample set as there's no evidence of a demand shift.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 61 units with 392 units in-transit. The history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as seen in the arrivals of orders from Periods 1 through 6). Daily demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but no clear trend, ranging between 55 and 125 units over the last 10 periods. The mean demand across all 10 periods is approximately 90.1, while the mean of the most recent 5 periods is approximately 89. Given the stability of both lead time and demand mean, I will use a period-lookback of 10 to capture the full variance while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This provides a total horizon (L+1) of 5 periods of demand to be covered by on-hand plus in-transit stock. The inventory position (61 + 392 = 453) is currently covering roughly 5 periods of demand at the current average, so the OR backend will order appropriately to maintain this base stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals from Period 1 through Period 7. Demand exhibits some variability but lacks a clear structural break or seasonal trend. The current demand samples (Periods 1-11) have a mean of approximately 91.3 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 90 and in-transit at 306, the total pipeline is 396 units. To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the average rate (~457 units), an order is needed. I will use 'calculate' for L as the 4-period lead time is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 11 available periods (recent_N=11) to capture the full variance and mean of the current demand regime, which helps the OR backend set a base stock level that targets the optimal service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 12 periods, with an average demand of approximately 93.6 units per period and a standard deviation around 23 units. Analyzing the delivery history, orders from Period 1 through Period 8 have all arrived with a consistent lead time of exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, in-transit inventory (308 units) consists of orders from Periods 9 (47 units), 10 (106 units), 11 (47 units), and 12 (108 units). Based on the established 4-period lead time, the Period 9 order (47 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 13 resolution phase and will be visible in the next status update. To maintain optimal stock levels while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a service level of 80%), I will use the established lead time of 4 and apply a recent_N strategy for both demand mean and volatility over the last 12 periods to capture the current stable regime.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but displays moderate variance, with an average of approximately 92.5 units over the last 13 periods. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, there are 40 units on hand and 391 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 10-13), which aligns with the pipeline required to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5 periods). Given the steady state without clear evidence of a significant regime shift, I will use a balanced lookback period for demand (N=10) to capture recent volatility while smoothing out extreme shocks. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that balances the high profit margin versus the holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been relatively stable with no clear evidence of a regime shift. The mean demand across all observed periods (including the preliminary samples provided in the prompt) is approximately 96 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 25. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in periods 5 through 14. In Period 15, we have 27 units on-hand and 348 units in-transit (reflecting orders from periods 11, 12, 13, and 14). Since the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, the 'default' method for L is appropriate. To capture the full distribution of this stable demand pattern, I will use the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which utilize all available historical data to calculate the base stock level. This configuration ensures the OR backend balances the service level required to meet demand across the L+1 period horizon against the holding costs for this specific product.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we ran out of stock (ending inventory 0, demand 113, sold 74) because the arrival from Period 11 (47 units) was insufficient. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current demand is stable but shows high variability (avg ~96, range 55-125). For Period 16, we expect the arrival of the order placed in Period 12 (108 units) during the arrival phase. Total in-transit is 437 units (from orders in Periods 12, 13, 14, 15). The OR backend uses (L+1) for its calculations. I will set L to 'default' (4) as it is stable. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the full history of realized demand while accounting for recent volatility, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts given the high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand surged to 229, which is significantly higher than the previous average of approx. 94 units. This caused a stockout (sold 108, ending inventory 0). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern (P12 order arrived P16). Total in-transit is 417 units (from orders in P13, P14, P15, P16). Given the sudden spike in demand, I must determine if this is a one-time outlier or a regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this upward movement while balancing against the previous stable period. This will increase the base stock level to proactively handle higher demand and avoid further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 16: demand reached 229, compared to previous 15-period average of 94 (+143%). Stockout occurred.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand in the last two periods (229, 243) is significantly higher than the initial average of approximately 94. This surge resulted in immediate stockouts and zero ending inventory for Periods 15, 16, and 17. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. To prevent further stockouts and capture the current high demand, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the recent demand jump (averaging ~236 per period). Since the demand volatility has also increased during this period, I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 512, which covers roughly 2 periods of this new demand; the system needs to maintain enough stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Setting parameters based on the last 2 periods will aggressively raise the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 16-17 average 236 units/period, compared to the previous average of 94 (+151%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. A significant upward demand regime shift occurred starting in Period 16. Comparing the first 15 periods (mean ~94) to the last 3 periods (16, 17, 18), the average demand has surged to 219.6 units per period. We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand 0) because the pipeline inventory ordered during the lower demand regime is insufficient. To capture this new regime, I will use a recent_N approach. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use N=3 to specifically weight the data from Periods 16-18, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects the ~220 units/period demand levels. The lead time (L) has consistently shown as 4 periods in all 'conclude' messages (P5 through P18), matching the promised lead time, so I will stick with the manual/promised setting of 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: High-demand regime (200+ units/period) sustained for 3 periods (P16-P18 average: 220). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20, facing a sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 16. In the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has averaged 216 units (229, 243, 187, 205), compared to the prior period average of ~94 units. This represents a significant +130% shift. Despite regular arrivals with a stable lead time of 4 periods, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts for five consecutive periods. Because our base stock calculation depends on the (1+L) window (which is 5 periods here), we must ensure the forecast reflects the new mean. I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this specific high-demand window (P16-P19). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P15 order arriving in P19). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. This approach will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to satisfy the elevated demand and recover from the current inventory deficit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift starting at Period 16. Previously, demand averaged around 94 units/period. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 211.6 units/period (229, 243, 187, 205, 194). We are currently experiencing stockouts as older, lower-quantity orders arrive. The in-transit pipeline (1003 units) reflects the adjustments made in Periods 17-20 to address this new regime. Given the lead time (L=4) and the need for a 5-period coverage (L+1), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples to capture this sustained high-demand regime while budgeting for the volatility seen in this new segment. L is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine the order quantity needed to bring the total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to the appropriate base stock level for a 211.6 mean demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for P16-P20 is 211.6, representing a ~125% increase from the pre-P16 mean of 94.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Prior to Period 16, mean demand was approximately 94 units. Since Period 16, the average demand (P16-P21) has increased to approximately 205.3 units (229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174). This represents a sustained jump of ~118%. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed from the 'conclude' messages. Although the on-hand inventory is currently 51, there is a large pipeline of 878 units (ordered during the high-demand periods 18-21) relative to current demand levels. To continue supporting the new demand level while preventing excessive holding costs as the pipeline arrives, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (the length of the new regime) to focus on the high-demand behavior. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the consistently observed historical lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand mean from Period 16 to Period 22 is approximately 209 units (229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174, 227). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (Period 18 order arrived in Period 22). Current inventory status shows 77 units on hand and 772 units in-transit. To ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of high demand, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture only the current regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to account for the increased volatility observed during this period. The 'calculate' method for L is appropriate as the actual lead time of 4 matches the promised lead time and has been stable.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~94 units/period to approximately 209 units/period (average of P16-P23: 208.6). The lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current period is 24 and the shift occurred at Period 16, we have 8 periods of data (P16-P23) representing the new regime. I will use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand and its volatility accurately. The OR backend will compute the base stock for a (L+1) horizon (5 periods) and subtract the large in-transit pipeline (745 units) to determine the next order. This approach balances the stockout risk seen in P15-P20 with the holding costs associated with the now-arriving large orders.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent high-demand period (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 203.8 units per period, compared to the initial 15-period mean of approximately 94. The last 5 periods (P20-P24) show a mean of 198 units with lower volatility as the new regime stabilizes. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods without any missing shipments. Current inventory (On-hand: 207, In-transit: 689) is substantial, reflecting the large orders placed during the initial stockout phase (P16-P20). With L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=9 (P16-P24) for mu_hat captures the entire high-demand period accurately, while recent_N=5 (P20-P24) for sigma_hat captures the more stable variance of the current period. This ensures we maintain a high service level for the new demand level while preventing excessive overstocking as the inventory pipeline catches up.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new high-demand regime since Period 16. In the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25), demand has been 174, 227, 206, 189, and 171, averaging approximately 193.4 units per period. This is a sustained increase from the pre-P16 average of ~94 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 761 units, and On-hand is 136, totaling 897 units. Given a lead time of 4, the base stock formula (L+1) covers 5 periods of demand. 5 * 193.4 = 967 units. To ensure high service levels and account for the high-end of this new regime's volatility, I will use a 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant data since the shift began. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the mean demand was approximately 94 units. Since Period 16, demand has consistently stayed in a higher range. Specifically, from Period 16 to Period 26 (the last 11 samples), the average demand is 201.9 units per period. The recent demand levels (last 5 periods: 227, 206, 189, 171, 196) average 197.8 units, suggesting the high-demand regime is stable. The lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 87 and 775 units in-transit (covering orders from P23, P24, P25, P26), the system is well-positioned, but must maintain the high-demand forecast to avoid future stockouts as the previous logic did. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this entire high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates the base stock based on the new mean (~202) and its associated volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P16-P26): mean demand increased from ~94 to ~202 (+115%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~94 units to over 200 units. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 203.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.3. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 105 and 725 units in-transit (orders from P24-P27), the pipeline is currently well-stocked to handle the current regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime, and 'default' for lead time as the 4-period promise is being consistently met.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to this, demand averaged approximately 94 units. From Period 16 to Period 28, the average demand has risen to approximately 202 units (a ~115% increase). The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as evidenced by the sequence of arrivals (e.g., Period 24 order arrived in Period 28). Current on-hand inventory is 98 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 756 units. Since the demand has stabilized at this higher level since Period 16 (13 samples), I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this newer, higher demand regime while excluding the irrelevant low-demand history. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by all recent arrivals.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the high-demand window (P16 to P29), the average demand is approximately 201.4 units/period with a standard deviation of roughly 25.5 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Therefore, I will use L=default (4 periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this stable high-demand regime specifically. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean (~201) and volatility (~25) from the current environment rather than the significantly lower historical average (~94 in P1-P15). Current on-hand is 102 units and in-transit is 792 units, which is sufficient given the cycle (L+1=5 periods) and targeted base stock levels.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~94 units/period to ~200 units/period. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is 201.5 units, confirming a stable new regime. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully arrived orders. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at this higher level. Specifically, using the last 15 periods (recent_N=15) captures the current mean of ~201.5 and the increased volatility observed during this regime. The backend OR engine will calculate a base stock of roughly 5 * 201.5 + buffer, which aligns with the current pipeline needs to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs for this $1.0/unit inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shifted significantly starting around Period 16, increasing from a mean of ~94 to ~200+ units per period. Recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime with Period 31 seeing a peak of 260. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P31). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 31. Total in-transit is 798 units (representing orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=15 (covering the period since the regime shift began) and assume the lead time remains at its promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a high level (mean ~204, \u03c3 ~28 over P16-P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~94 to ~205 units per period. Since Period 16, the average demand (P16-P32) is approximately 207 units with a standard deviation of 27. The most recent demand (P31-P32) shows a slight uptick (260, 241), so I will use N=17 (the length of the current regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the sustained high demand while smoothing volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (arrived units for P28 order confirmed arrival in P32). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to high demand exceeding arrivals, necessitating a robust base stock to prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the optimal service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $832.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~94 to a higher level. Over the last 18 periods (P16-P33), mean demand is approximately 209 with a standard deviation of 27. The last 5 periods (P29-P33) show a slightly higher mean of ~233. Inventory is currently struggling to keep up with this higher demand, with ending inventory at 0 for the last three periods (P31-P33) despite arrivals. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and verified by multiple 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while maintaining enough sample size for stability. This will calculate a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), aiming for a high service level given the profit margin ($4 profit / $1 holding cost = 80% critical ratio, though the OR engine uses z* and a cap).

The demand regime shifted around Period 16 and has remained consistently high. For the periods P16 to P34, the mean demand is approximately 207 units with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Since Period 31, we have experienced stockouts because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) were insufficient to meet this sustained demand level. Leading into Period 35, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have a significant pipeline (935 units) consisting of orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as confirmed by the continuous sequence of arrivals (e.g., P30 order arrived in P34). I will use the last 19 samples (P16-P34) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entire high-demand regime and provides a more stable estimate than shorter windows. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level tailored to the current 200+ unit demand profile while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the recent 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 210 units with a standard deviation of about 26. At the start of Period 36, on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in the last five periods (P31-P35), although a large in-transit pipeline of 886 units is present. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrivals (e.g., P31 order arrived P35). To address the current stockout and align with the high-demand regime, I am using recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~210) and volatility accurately. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is calculated against the 210-unit average (~1050 units total) while the OR backend's capping logic prevents excessive over-ordering relative to the pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~94 to a higher mean of ~204. Recent demand (P31-P36) shows sustained higher levels (260, 241, 229, 190, 202, 150), although Period 36 was slightly lower. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36). Currently, on-hand inventory is 97 units. We have a robust pipeline (837 units), and the OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will use our parameters to determine the order size. Given the stable high-demand regime since P16, I will use a window of 21 periods (N=21, covering P16-P36) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific regime's behavior. Lead time estimation will remain at the promised 4 periods using the 'calculate' method as it aligns with observed history.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 and has remained in a high-demand state. For the most recent 22 periods (P16-P37), the mean demand is approximately 201 units. In the very recent past (last 10 periods, P28-P37), the mean demand is 207.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods. The inventory position is currently recovering from a series of stockouts, with 146 units on hand and a substantial pipeline of 726 units. Setting N=22 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entire current high-demand regime, while L remains at the default promised lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained demand pattern while the backend's capped policy manages the over-ordering risk from the large in-transit volume.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained elevated. Over the last 23 periods (P16-P38), the mean demand is approximately 201.7 units with a standard deviation of 29.5. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the high-demand regime is the 'new normal' and well-established (over 20 periods), I am using a recent_N window of 20 periods to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while filtering out the much lower pre-P16 data. Current inventory (200 on-hand + 692 in-transit) is being managed to meet this higher demand (baseline order requirement approx 202 units/period).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. In the most recent 10-period window (P30-P39), the average demand is 205.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39 (matching the promised 4-period duration). Currently, the supply chain is well-stocked with 150 units on hand and 703 units in transit, which covers approximately 4.1 periods of the current average demand. I will use the last 24 periods (since the regime shift at P16) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend captures the sustained higher mean and variance while maintaining a lead time of 4. This will allow the backend to maintain a safe base stock level relative to the high-demand regime while accounting for the regular 4-period delivery cycle.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 16 to 40), the mean demand is approximately 203 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 36 order arriving in Period 40). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 184 units and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 718 units (comprising orders from Periods 37, 38, 39, and 40). To maintain the optimal service level where the backend calculates base stock based on a critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this established regime. Setting N=25 covers the period from the regime shift (P16) to the present (P40), which captures the relevant statistical properties of the current market state.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units and a standard deviation of 28 units over the last 26 periods (P16-P41). Current on-hand inventory is 140, and in-transit inventory is 735 (representing orders from periods 38, 39, 40, and 41). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all recent delivery data (e.g., P37 order arrived in P41). To maintain the optimal service level dictated by the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) ratio (critical ratio = 0.8), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=26 to capture the full scope of the current steady regime. This ensures the OR backend uses the most accurate mean and volatility estimates for this specific product life-cycle phase.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 201 units over the last 27 periods (P16-P42). The most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) show an average demand of 186.8 units, while the 10-period average (P33-P42) is 190.9 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 139 units, with 715 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P39-P42). Since the service level requirement (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) is moderate and the demand regime is stable, I will use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics while smoothing out minor fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the recent 20 periods (P24-P43), the mean demand is approximately 197.8 with a standard deviation of about 26.6. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, which I will continue to use. In-transit inventory (741 units) and on-hand inventory (81 units) are sufficient to cover the current demand regime over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). However, since we are entering the final periods of the simulation (P44-P50), maintaining a steady-state inventory is crucial. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable high-demand regime without including the initial transition volatility.

The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 105 units, with 754 units in transit (cumulative orders from P41 to P44), which covers the pipeline for the next 4 periods.

The backend will use these to maintain the base stock level relative to the lead time (L=4).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 30 periods (P16-P45), the mean demand is approximately 199.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.6. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival in Period 45 (ordered P41) confirming this. Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 units and there is a total of 726 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a base stock policy where mu_hat and sigma_hat represent the total demand and volatility over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Setting mu_hat using the last 30 samples (N=30) captures the current stable high-demand regime since the shift. This provides a mu_hat of ~996.5 and a sigma_hat of ~61.7. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level q is 0.8, resulting in a z-score of ~0.84. This configuration ensures that total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is maintained at a level that minimizes stockouts while managing holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 201 units and a standard deviation around 28. Observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 113 units, and there are 788 units in transit. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (Period 47) with a lead time of 4 periods will arrive during the Arrival Resolution of Period 51 and thus will NOT be available for sale within the 50-period horizon. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current pipeline against the target base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=31 to capture the entire stable high-demand regime from Period 16 to Period 46, ensuring the base stock calculation accurately reflects the increased volume and variability compared to the initial 15 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $593.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistently high since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 197 units over the last 32 periods. Recent demand (P40-P47) shows a mean of 184.4 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 3 decision cycles remaining (including this one), the OR backend needs to maintain coverage without over-ordering as we approach the end of the simulation. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=32 to capture the full stability of the current high-demand regime while filtering out the initial low-demand period (P1-P15). L is set to 'default' as the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Since Period 16, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the last 33 periods (P16-P48), the average demand is approximately 197 units per period with a standard deviation of 27 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival data since the beginning. My strategy for this period is to maintain the base stock level observed in this high-demand regime using a 33-period window (N=33). Although Period 50 is the final period and normally one might reduce orders to minimize holding costs, the specific OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) and the lead time of 4 mean that any order placed now will not arrive before the simulation ends at Period 50. However, the system requires valid parameters to satisfy the simulation logic. I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=33 to reflect the current steady state, and 'default' for L as the lead time is stable at 4.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units over the last 34 periods (P16-P49). The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrivals (P45-P49). Currently, the inventory position (On-hand 123 + In-transit 719 = 842) is robust. Given the stable demand pattern and reliable lead time, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=34 to cover the entire current demand regime. This will help the OR backend calculate an appropriate base stock for a (L+1) horizon (5 periods), ensuring enough inventory to cover the lead time while managing holding costs.
