Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or prior order history to evaluate lead-time accuracy. The historical demand data provided (Periods 1-5 from a previous similar context, or simply as seed data) shows a mean demand of approximately 91 units ((105+36+108+110+96)/5) with a standard deviation of approximately 31. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the default methods initially is most prudent as we establish a baseline. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), which the OR backend will calculate. Given the provided 'Historical Demand Data', the OR backend's 'default' setting will use these values to compute the base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. An order of 143 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. Because L=4, we do not expect this order to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales (62 units in Period 1). The demand samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) plus the actual Period 1 demand (62) show high volatility but an average around 86. Since we are in the very early stages and have no observed lead times Yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including the new Period 1 demand point) to capture the most recent demand behavior while we wait for the pipeline to arrive. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Evaluation of the first two periods shows that demand (62 in P1, 161 in P2) is significantly higher than the initial provided distribution (mean ~91). However, we are currently experiencing a 100% stockout because zero units have arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods, so an order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit is 280 (143 from P1 + 137 from P2). Given the high demand in the first two periods and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend needs to balance the risk. Since we only have 2 periods of actual history which show higher demand than the seed data, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to weight the recent spikes, while keeping the lead time at default as no deliveries have been missed yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 446 units in-transit (from orders in Periods 1, 2, and 3). Historical demand for Periods 1-3 shows values of 62, 161, and 76 respectively. However, the provided 'Historical Demand Data' in the prompt (which usually represents a broader context or pre-game samples) lists Period 1-5 as 105, 36, 108, 110, 96. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand with N=3 to capture the volatility seen in the game history (62, 161, 76), while relying on the promised lead time (L=4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest otherwise. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. A higher sigma is appropriate given the high variance in the first three periods.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-4 have not yet arrived. According to the 1-period observation delay, the arrival of the Period 1 order should occur during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in significant lost sales. Demand for the first 4 periods was 62, 161, 76, and 60 (average ~90). The 'in-transit' total of 499 units matches the sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (143+137+166+53=499). Since no orders have concluded yet, actual lead time cannot be inferred to differ from promised. I will use a conservative average of all 4 demand samples to forecast, as there is high variance (especially the spike in Period 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (from the static data provided in instructions) or 62, 161, 76, 60, 64 (from the game history). I will prioritize 'Game History' demand as it reflects the current session's actual realization. The average demand over the last 5 periods is 84.6 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and the arrival in Period 5 (ordered P1, lead_time=4) confirms that the actual lead time is currently matching the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory is high (356 units) as orders from P2, P3, and P4 are still in transit. Given that holding costs are high ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's base-stock logic (z-score for q=0.5 is 0) will target a 50% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the observed variance and mean from history, and 'default' for lead time since the promise is holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 105 units, and 219 units are in-transit (ordered in Periods 3 and 4). Analysis of the last two concluded arrivals (Period 5 and Period 6) confirms the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since Lead Time (L) is 4, the inventory cycle covers 5 periods (L+1). Historical demand samples (Period 1 to Period 6) are 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, and 111. The mean demand is 89.0 with a standard deviation of 40.1. Using 'default' for L (4 periods), 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat (to capture the current demand mean), and 'recent_N' with N=6 for sigma_hat provides a stable forecast. The OR backend will calculate a base stock of roughly (5 * 89) + z * (sqrt(5) * 40.1). Given profit and holding cost are equal, q = 0.5 and z* = 0, leading to a base stock around 445 units. With 105 on hand and 219 in transit, the pipeline is 324, allowing for a measured order to reach the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 arrival at P5 and P2 arrival at P6).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand samples for \u2018chips(Regular)\u2019 are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65]. The most recent 7 periods (since the game start) show demand of [62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65], with an average of ~85.6. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). The promised lead time is also 4. On-hand inventory is 206, and In-transit is 174 (consisting of orders from P4, P7, and potentially P8). Total pipeline (including OH) is 380 units. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the target base stock is the median of demand over (L+1) periods. 5 periods * ~85.6 = ~428 units. Current inventory (380) is slightly below this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand to capture the realized volatility since the game began, while keeping lead time at 'default' (4).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 136 and in-transit inventory of 169 (corresponding to orders from Periods 7 and 8). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across four distinct arrivals (P1-P4). Historical demand mean from Period 1 to 8 is 90.25 (stdev ~38). The current high pipeline (169) plus on-hand (136) totaling 305 units is sufficient to cover approximately 3.4 periods of demand at current rates. Given L=4, we need to ensure the base stock levels are maintained. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for demand parameters to capture the variability across all available demand samples while acknowledging the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that demand has been relatively stable with a mean around 90-100 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 arrived exactly 4 periods later). In Period 9, no arrival was expected because no order was placed in Period 5. The current on-hand inventory is 32, with 316 units in transit (orders from P7, P8, and P9). Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the last 9 samples to calculate demand since Period 1's demand was recorded before the first arrival and looks like a standard part of the distribution. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (Periods 5-8) confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. However, the system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) because no orders were placed in Periods 5 and 6, resulting in no arrivals in Periods 9 and 10. We have 427 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 7, 8, 9, 10), where the Period 7 order (121 units) is expected to arrive during Period 11 and be visible in the next report. Demand shows steady volatility without a clear regime shift, though recent demand has averaged around 90-100 units. To manage the current stock-out and bridge the (L+1) = 5 period window, I will use a recent_N approach. N=10 captures all available demand data (including the seed data provided in the prompt) to calculate a stable mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by Period 11's arrival of the Period 7 order). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 90 units (current history: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 from setup + 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123, 104, 91, 68 from game history). On-hand inventory is 53, and in-transit is 338. Note that orders from Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11 are currently in-transit. Calculated base stock for L=4 (covering 5 periods) at a mean of 90 is 450. Pipeline inventory (In-transit + On-hand) is 391. The OR system will likely place an order around 59 units to bridge this. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand stabilization while accounting for enough variance to handle spikes.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Examining history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, and P12). In-transit inventory is 361 units, comprising orders from P9 (147), P10 (111), P11 (32), and P12 (71). We expect the P9 order (147 units) to arrive during P13. Current demand has remained relatively stable. Historical demand samples (including the initial 5 provided) range from 36 to 161. Calculating demand mean across the 12 concluded periods: (62+161+76+60+64+111+65+123+104+91+68+88)/12 = 89.4. With L=4, the review+lead period is 5. mu_hat should target ~447 units (5 * 89.4). Given the profit/holding ratio of 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (the median). I will use the 'calculate' method for L and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical window, as no significant demand regime shift is evident beyond normal variance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The most recent demand samples are: P9: 104, P10: 91, P11: 68, P12: 88, P13: 106. The mean demand of these last 5 periods is 91.4 units. Using a longer window of 13 periods, the mean is 89.15. There is no clear shift in demand regime, so I will use recent_N=10 to capture a stable average (approx 89.2). For the OR logic, \u03bc\u0302 needs to cover review+lead time (1+4=5 periods), so a \u03bc\u0302 based on an average of ~89.2 results in ~446. The current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 290 and on-hand is 54, totaling 344. Since 344 < 446, an order will be triggered. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are consistently 4, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to balance recent trends with statistical stability.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a mean around 91-92 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as previously confirmed. Period 15 starts with 25 units on hand and 275 units in transit (ordered in P11-P14). Since demand fluctuates but shows no clear regime shift or seasonality (dates are generic), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture recent variance while maintaining stability. The lead time 'L' will be set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is being met consistently. The cost structure (Profit $1, Holding $1) implies a 50% target service level, meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods). Current pipeline (300 units) roughly covers 3.3 periods of average demand (approx 91 units/period), so the model will likely place a small order to maintain the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the delivery history (e.g., Period 11 delivery was ordered in Period 7; Period 15 delivery was ordered in Period 11). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 15 where demand (99) exceeded supply (57). Although there are 382 units in-transit, the system's pipeline is tight relative to demand. Demand over the last 15 periods has a mean of approximately 95, but there's a visible upward trend or increased volatility in recent periods (P14: 140, P15: 99). Setting L to default (4) is appropriate given the data. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand level (~95.3 per period) more accurately than the full history, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to account for recent demand variance and mitigate further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant demand spike observed in Period 16 (227 units compared to an earlier average of ~95). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning orders placed today will arrive in Period 21. Our pipeline (in-transit) is 427 units, which encompasses orders from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16. Specifically, we expect arrivals of 76 (P13), 96 (P14), 139 (P15), and 116 (P16). Given the sudden increase in demand volatility and volume in the most recent period, I will adjust the demand forecast using a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) to capture the upward trend without overreacting solely to the P16 outlier, while maintaining a default lead time of 4. This balances the need to recover from stockouts while managing holding costs, as both profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (z=0) for the base stock calculation, though the OR backend's cap provides additional safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly at Period 16: demand jumped to 227 (+138% vs previous avg). Monitoring for sustained regime shift.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18. Demand has shifted significantly starting at Period 16 (227) and Period 17 (186), compared to the prior mean of ~95. This likely indicates a new higher demand regime or seasonal spike. My goal is to capture this recent shift while accounting for the lead time. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts due to the sudden demand surge. The 577 units in-transit includes orders from P14 (96), P15 (139), P16 (116), and P17 (226). The P14 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 18. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to the high demand observed in periods 15-17 (averaging ~170/period). L is set to default as the lead time is consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 demand averaged 206, a +116% increase over the first 15 periods (avg 95). Current stockout situation requires high mu_hat to recover.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 19. Inventory is at 0 (on-hand) for the fourth consecutive period due to a sustained demand regime shift that began at Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 227, 186, and 210, averaging 207.7 units per period, which is more than double the average of the first 15 periods (approx 95). Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data (P5-P18) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since we have been in a stockout situation, our recorded demand likely reflects true demand (lost sales not captured in inventory but visible in demand logs). We must maintain a high mu_hat to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime, and keep L at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 16. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has jumped from an average of ~95 units (Periods 1-15) to ~198 units per period (Periods 16-19), a 108% increase. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts for the last 5 periods because the arrivals (from lower historical orders) cannot keep up with this new demand level. The Lead Time is stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the higher demand level (approx 198 * 5 = 990 total for the lead time plus review period). This will ensure the base_stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 4 periods to account for the increased volatility observed during this shift. We have a large pipeline (861 units) due to aggressive orders placed in Periods 17-19; the OR backend will subtract this from the required base_stock to determine the new order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 16-19 demand averages 198 units, representing a sustained ~100% increase over the baseline of ~95. Monitoring for any further spikes or mean-reversion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), the average demand is 200.6 units, compared to the previous baseline of ~95. The system is currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand is 0) despite consistent arrivals, because historical order quantities were based on the old regime. Total pipeline inventory is 877 units, and arrivals should now start increasing as orders from the high-demand period begin to arrive (specifically the 226 units ordered in P17 are expected in P21/P22). I will set L to 'default' as the lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current 200-unit demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to bridge the current stockout and reach the target service level.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~198. For Period 22, the most recent 6 samples (Period 16-21) provide the best estimation of this new regime (mean: 198.3, std: 20.3). While Period 21 finally ended with a small surplus (39 units), we are still recovering from a long stockout period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all recent arrivals. We maintain L=4. We use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the sustained high demand and for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in this new regime, ensuring the base stock level (1+L) * 198.3 + z * sqrt(1+L) * 20.3 is sufficient to prevent further stockouts while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each).

With on-hand inventory recovered to 143 and a large pipeline of 676 units (orders from P19-P22), the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of this higher demand level. Using N=7 for recent_N captures the entirety of this new regime. This approach will stabilize the ordering process now that the stockout phase has ended and the pipeline is full.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from a mean of ~95 to approximately 196 (average of Periods 16-23: [227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205]). This represents a stable, higher demand level that has now persisted for 8 periods. Inventory has recovered from the stockout phase thanks to aggressive ordering (On-hand is now 180). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the new average of ~196 units per period, scaled by (1+L). Sigma_hat is also set using the last 8 periods to reflect the current demand volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~190. In the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24), demand observations are 209, 187, 173, 205, and 158, resulting in a mean of 186.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this new leveled-off regime while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for a high-service level (profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% service level target, but with stockouts historically being an issue, recent_N allows for a more responsive buffer). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~190. For the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 191.0 with a standard deviation of 21.0. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods as promised. Observed inventory is stabilizing after the initial stockout during the regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 96 and in-transit is 652 units. An arrival of 176 units (ordered Period 22) is expected during Period 26. I will use recent_N=10 to capture this 'high demand' regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain L at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P16-P25): Mean demand is 191.0 units/period with a standard deviation of 21.0.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from a baseline mean of approximately 95 to a higher mean around 191 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 26) was 219, indicating continued strength in this higher regime. Since Period 16, demand has consistently stayed within the 170-230 range (except for Period 24 which was slightly lower). Therefore, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the backend uses statistics that reflect the current market conditions rather than the lower historical average. The lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent historical arrivals.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, moving from an average of ~95 units/period to approximately 191 units/period. The last 12 periods (P16-P27) show consistent demand within this new higher range (Mean: 191.6, Std: 21.0). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and consistent based on arrival confirmations. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (8 units), but pipeline inventory is robust (758 units). The OR backend uses a lead time L=4 and calculates a base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. To capture the current regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 samples (N=12) to ensure the system accurately reflects the ~191 mean and ~21 volatility. This approach balances the need to maintain service levels for the higher demand while considering the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the profit ($1.0), implying a critical ratio q=0.5 (Safety stock targeting the mean).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from an average of ~95 units to ~190 units per period. The most recent 10 periods (P19-P28) show a mean demand of 188.3 units and a standard deviation of 19.3. The current on-hand inventory is 39 units, with 752 units in-transit. Based on the consolidated lead time of 4 periods, we expect the order from Period 25 (110 units) to arrive in Period 29, followed by the order from Period 26 (207 units) in Period 30. The parameters L=4, mu_hat (recent_N=10), and sigma_hat (recent_N=10) are chosen to capture this stabilized higher demand regime while maintaining a high service level, given that profit and holding costs are equal (q=0.5, z*=0). This ensures the base stock covers (L+1) periods of the current demand mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the recent 14 periods (P16-P29), the mean demand is approximately 195 units per period with a standard deviation of 21.6. In Period 29, the inventory stocked out again (sold 149 vs demand 211) despite an arrival of 110 units, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of P29 (P25 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). To address the stockout and maintain high service levels (critical since profit and holding cost are both $1.0, implying a 50% critical fractile, though the OR backend's inventory policy tends toward a slightly higher baseline for stability), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14. This targets the current demand regime and ensures the OR backend uses a mean that reflects the nearly 200 unit/period consumption rate observed since the spike. Current in-transit (794) covers approximately 4 periods of demand, which aligns with the total lead-time-plus-one-period requirement of the base-stock policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P29) confirmed: Average ~195 units/period (+105% vs baseline), Std Dev ~21.6.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from a mean of ~95 to ~195 units per period. Evaluating the demand from Period 16 to Period 30 (15 samples), the average demand is 195.1 units with a standard deviation of 21.0. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, we are in a stockout situation (on-hand inventory = 0) with 765 units in transit. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the current demand regime (P16-P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock approximately equal to 5 * 195 = 975 units. Subtracting the 765 in-transit units, the backend should order approximately 210 units to reach this level, which aligns with recent demand needs.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 31 (16 samples), the mean demand is approximately 194.5 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~95 units. The standard deviation for this new high-demand period is roughly 22.3. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P23 through P27). I am using 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture this entire high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock calculation (which targets a 50% service level given Profit=Holding=$1) is grounded in the current high-demand reality. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is currently high at 751, but with lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (approx 972 units). Current inventory (56 on-hand + 751 in-transit = 807) is slightly below this requirement, so the OR backend will likely place a replenishment order.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained stable through Period 32. Analyzing the most recent 17 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is 196.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 22.1. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P27 and P28 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is low (47), but there is a significant pipeline of 714 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 3.6 periods of demand (714 / 196.5). Using recent_N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures this higher demand level and its associated volatility. The 'calculate' method for L is appropriate as it will confirm the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted from ~95 to ~195 units/period starting at Period 16. In the most recent block (P30-P34), average demand has slightly increased further to 204.4 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 30.0. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 34, although lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the service level targets the median (z=0). To stabilize availability while accounting for the recent slight uptick and higher localized volatility (especially P34's 237), I will use the last 19 periods (P16-P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entire high-demand regime. This provides a balance between long-term regime stability and recent volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 196 units and a standard deviation of around 22. In the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 198.8 units (174, 214, 170, 237, 199), confirming the sustained nature of this higher demand level (+100% vs. the initial baseline). Lead times are consistently 4 periods. With only 17 units on-hand and 768 units in-transit (covering roughly 3.9 periods of future demand at the current rate), the inventory position is tight. To maintain service levels given high demand volatility and equal profit/holding costs (suggesting a 50% service level for base stock before the cap), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while smoothing recent fluctuations. This will set mu_hat roughly at (1+4)*196 = 980 and sigma_hat at sqrt(5)*22 = 49.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 and has remained stable at an elevated level. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P17-P36), the mean demand is 196.4. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the shipment that arrived in Period 36 was insufficient to cover the demand of 237. There are 829 units in-transit (orders from P33-P36). Using a lead time of 4, the target inventory should cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime while filtering out the much lower demand from the first 15 periods. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that reflects the current mean (~196) and variance, ensuring we recover from the current stockout.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 22 periods (P16-P37), the average demand is 199.3 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. In the very recent window (last 5 periods), the average is slightly higher at 210 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 11 units on hand and 768 units in transit (covering roughly 3.8 periods of demand), the current inventory position is tight but largely managed by the pipeline. I will use the recent 22-period regime (N=22) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend captures this sustained higher demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P37) update: Average 199.3 units/period, Std Dev 22.8. Recent 5-period (P33-P37) demand shows a slight uptick to 210.2 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 remains stable, with current mean demand over the P16\u2013P38 period being approximately 199.1 units/period. Recent 5-period demand (P34\u2013P38) is slightly higher at 218.2, but remains within the established variance (std dev ~23). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in P38 caused by demand (210) exceeding beginning on-hand (174). I have 822 units in-transit. To ensure high service levels given the $1/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost (optimal service level q=0.5, but the system's cap and base stock logic handles the actual ordering), I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime at P16) to provide a stable forecast of the mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand while respecting the pipeline inventory already in flight.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) remains in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is approximately 213 units per period, showing a slight further increase from the previously recorded regime average of ~199. The standard deviation in this recent window is approximately 24. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0), and we are relying on incoming shipments to meet demand. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). However, given the recent uptick and frequent stockouts, I am using recent_N=10 to capture the current mean more accurately. I will set L to default (4) as shipments are arriving exactly as promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P30-P39) update: Mean demand has increased to 212.8 units/period (+7% vs previous regime) with steady volatility (Std Dev ~24.5).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new regime since Period 30. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P30-P40), the average demand is 212.9 units per period with a standard deviation of 24.1. This represents a sustained increase over the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P36 order on P40. Current inventory levels are low (On-hand: 12), and while there is a significant amount in-transit (804 units), the OR backend needs updated parameters to reflect the higher demand mean and variance to ensure sufficient base stock levels. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this latest demand profile accurately for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time setting.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 16, with a further slight uptick observed from Period 30 onwards. Current mean demand (P30-P41) is approximately 209 units per period with a standard deviation of 23. This is significantly higher than the initial baseline. In-transit inventory (889 units) is substantial, including orders from Periods 38-41. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 41. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (as profit equals holding cost, the target service level is 50%, but the backend capping and the need to recover from stockouts favor a slightly more robust inventory position), I will use recent_N to capture the current stable demand regime. I am setting N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to cover the period since the last meaningful uptick (P30) and L=default as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 30. Analyzing the most recent data (P30-P42), the mean demand is approximately 209.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 25.1. Although P42 saw a dip (170), it is within the expected variance of the current regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 47 units on hand and 847 in transit (covering roughly 4 future periods of demand), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (recent_N=13) to capture this sustained high-demand phase while filtering out the earlier low-demand baseline. This approach maintains a high service level while managing holding costs as we approach the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P30-P42) consolidated: Mean demand is ~210 units/period with a Std Dev of ~25. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 30. Comparing the most recent segment (P30-P43), the mean demand is 210.9 units per period with a standard deviation of 26.6. Despite some stockouts, the arrivals have been consistent with a 4-period lead time. In Period 43, there was a stockout due to a demand spike of 250 units, leaving 0 on-hand inventory. The total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 824 units, which at the current mean demand of ~211 units/period, covers nearly 4 periods. Since we are at Period 44 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 48. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (covering the regime from P30 to P43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this latest demand level and volatility while maintaining a steady base stock policy.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a higher regime since Period 30. Analyzing the most recent stable period (P30-P44), the mean demand is approximately 215.3 units per period with a standard deviation of 26.5. In Period 44, 252 units arrived (ordered P40), leaving 17 units on-hand after a demand of 235. The carry-over insights correctly identified a sustained shift around P30. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 (covering P30-P44) to capture this most recent stabilized regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that accounts for the higher volume and volatility observed in these last 15 periods, aiming to maintain high service levels while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P30-P44) stable: Mean demand increased to 215.3 units/period with a Std Dev of 26.5. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 30. Analyzing the most recent period (P30-P45), the average demand is approximately 213 units per period with a standard deviation of 26. Since Period 46 is nearing the end of the game (T=50), and we have a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50. The current on-hand inventory is 70, and in-transit inventory is 810. The pipeline is heavily loaded with orders from Periods 42, 43, 44, and 45. I will set mu_hat to the recent mean of 213 to ensure we cover the remaining periods through the end of the horizon, using recent_N (N=16) to focus on this stable high-demand regime since P30. L is kept at the confirmed value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 213 units and a standard deviation of 25-26. The latest periods (P43-P46) show demand of 250, 235, 190, and 224, averaging 224.75, which is slightly higher than the Period 30-44 average (215.3). Lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods across the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is low (21 units), but there is significant inventory in-transit (817 units). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns with using the mean demand (mu_hat) without a large safety stock (sigma_hat). I will use the recent regime (P30-P46, N=17) to define mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most current stable demand state. Since the simulation is nearing its end (Period 47 of 50), maintaining a steady supply to meet this 215-225 range is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P30-P46) update: Mean demand remains elevated at ~216 units/period with a Std Dev of ~25. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $175.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a mean of approximately 216 units/period (observed since Period 30). In Period 47, we saw another slight stockout (demand 204 vs 175 available), which reinforces the need to maintain protective inventory. In-transit inventory is 891 units, which corresponds to orders placed from Period 44 to 47 (238, 243, 182, 228). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50), and the OR backend's base-stock logic already accounts for the pipeline, I will continue using the recent_N method with N=18 (covering the period since the demand shift at Period 30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure demand estimates are weighted toward the current high-demand state while smoothing out recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 49 (near the end of the simulation at Period 50), the demand regime has remained stable since Period 30. The mean demand for the most recent 19 periods (P30-P48) is approximately 211.7 units with a standard deviation of 24.3. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we are at the penultimate period, our goal is to maintain sufficient inventory to cover the final period's demand without overstocking, as any leftover inventory at the end of Period 50 will incur holding costs with no further sales. The current pipeline inventory (In-transit: 825) plus on-hand (64) is 889 units. Given a lead time L=4, the base stock formula (1+L)*mu_hat targets ~1058 units (5 * 211.6). We will use 'recent_N' with N=19 to capture this stable high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend orders enough to satisfy demand for the remaining periods while balancing the service level.

Daily Profit: $169.00, Daily Holding Cost: $138.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since approximately Period 30. Analysis of the demand from Period 30 up to Period 49 shows a mean demand of approximately 210.3 units per period (Avg of P30-P49) with a standard deviation of roughly 25.3. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P45-P49) has softened slightly (avg 188.2), but the overall regime remains much higher than the initial baseline. The Lead Time has been extremely consistent at exactly 4 periods since the start of the game (verified by every arrival from Period 5 through Period 49). Current inventory levels are healthy with 138 units on-hand and 746 in-transit (covering roughly 3.5 periods of demand). To maintain the optimal service level where profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), I will set the base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand using the established regime mean and variance. I'll use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime (P30-P50) while staying within the allowed limit (N=20).
