Based on the 5 historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), the average demand is approximately 91 units per period. The OR recommendation suggests ordering 143 units.

The OR recommendation of 137 units is based on a base-stock level calculated for (L+1) = 5 periods. 3.

The OR recommendation of 149 units seems high because it might be overreacting to the 0 on-hand status without accounting for the large pipeline relative to the long lead time.

The mean demand is approximately 90 units/period, but it fluctuates significantly. To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at a mean of 90, we need a base stock of roughly 450 units, plus safety stock.\n4. **OR Baseline**: The OR recommendation is 136 units.

Strategy: I will override the OR recommendation of 124 and order 200 units. The pipeline is currently full, but given the recent demand surge and the stockout state, I need to ensure that the replenishment arriving in 4 periods is sufficient to cover a sustained high-demand scenario.

The OR recommendation of 81 is significantly under-forecasting because it averages older, low-demand data (P1-P15) with the current high-demand data. With an inventory position of 769 (69 on-hand + 700 in-transit) and a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (P27-P31). At an estimated 200 units/period, the target inventory (base stock) should be around 1,000 to 1,100 units to ensure service levels and account for standard deviation in this new regime. The current pipeline of 700 units consists of orders from P23 (200), P24 (200), P25 (150), and P26 (150). These will arrive in Periods 27, 28, 29, and 30 respectively.

These are expected to arrive in Periods 28, 29, 30, and 31 respectively. The OR recommendation of 94 units is likely too low because it calculates the 'base stock' using historical averages that include the low-demand Period 1-15 data, and its internal cap is dampening the order too much given the current high-demand regime. To maintain a safe inventory level for (L+1) periods (approx 1000 units total), I need to account for the pipeline (700) and on-hand (69). Current total supply is 769 units. To cover 5 periods of demand at a 200/period rate (1000 total), an order of ~231 is theoretically needed.

With the game ending at Period 50, orders placed now (Period 46) will arrive in Period 50 (46 + 4). Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, my final order must cover the remaining demand for Periods 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50. Total periods to cover = 5. Average demand has stabilized at approximately 215 units per period. Total needed inventory = 215 * 5 = 1075 units. Current On-hand is 20 units. In-transit arrivals expected are: P42 order (220), P43 order (230), P44 order (230), and P45 order (235), totaling 915 units in the pipeline. Total existing supply = 20 + 915 = 935 units. To meet the target of 1075 units, I need to order 1075 - 935 = 140 units. The OR recommendation of 88 is bridge-based and does not account for the specific endgame horizon (only 1 order remaining that can arrive).

Consequently, ordering any units now results in zero potential for sales while specifically adding to the terminal 'In-transit' balance or providing no utility. The focus now is on managing the current 'On-hand' (16 units) and 'In-transit' (835 units) to satisfy demand for the remaining periods (47, 48, 49, 50). Specifically, the orders from Period 43 (230 units), Period 44 (230 units), Period 45 (235 units), and Period 46 (140 units) are scheduled to arrive during Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 respectively. These arrivals, plus current stock, total 851 units, which comfortably covers the expected demand of ~860 units (4 periods * ~215 average demand) with minimal risk of massive stockouts and zero risk of useless end-of-game inventory holding costs for new orders.

The game ends at Period 50. Orders placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52 (P48 + 4) because the arrival resolution happens during the period and is visible the next. Since the game ends at P50, any order placed in P48, P49, or P50 will *never* arrive in time to be sold. \n4. **Final Strategy**: Period 48 is the 'cutoff' for orders given L=4. An order placed now arrives in P52. We have enough in-transit (605 units) and on-hand (42) to cover the remaining periods (P48, P49, P50), which require roughly 640 units total.
