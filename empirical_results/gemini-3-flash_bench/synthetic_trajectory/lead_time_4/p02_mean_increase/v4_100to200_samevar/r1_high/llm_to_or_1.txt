Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data yet to infer the actual lead time, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 4 periods. The goal is to set a base stock level that covers demand during the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Looking at the provided historical demand samples for the first 5 periods (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), the average demand is 91 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 31 units. Given that this is the first decision and we have limited context beyond these initial samples, I will use a conservative approach utilizing all available samples (N=5) to estimate mean and volatility. By setting L to default (4) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5), the OR backend will calculate a base stock designed to maintain a high service level (~95% based on the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio) while guarding against demand variance over the 5-period risk window.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 143 units based on the promised lead time (L=4). The initial demand of 62 resulted in lost sales because we started with 0 inventory. The order of 143 units is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive in Period 5 (provided L=4 holds). The current demand samples are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96] from the description and 62 from Period 1 results; however, the prompt also provides specific historical demand data: [105, 36, 108, 110, 96]. Mean demand \u2248 91. I will use the 'default' method for L to respect the promised lead time of 4 until data suggests otherwise. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I'll use the mean of all available historical samples (default) or a recent window if I detect a shift. Given we only have 1 period of official game history (62) against the provided sample list, I will use 'default' to capture the broad distribution. This sets base_stock to cover (4+1) periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The lead time is promised at 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). We have 280 units in-transit (143 from P1, 137 from P2). Demand in P1 was 62 and P2 was 161. While the historical seeding data (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) suggested a mean around 91, the actual game demand so far (62, 161) shows higher variability. Since we are in the 'dark' period before any arrivals (P1-P5), we must ensure our parameters cover the (L+1)=5 period window. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4) and use the last 5 samples of historical demand data to set the forecast, as it represents a broader baseline until more game-specific demand is observed.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4 with 0 on-hand inventory and 446 units in-transit. No orders have arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods (the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at Period 6). Demand has been volatile (62, 161, 76), and the historical samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) suggest a mean around 90-100. However, the game history demand (62, 161, 76) shows more variance. I will use the default promised lead time (L=4) for now. For demand (mu_hat), since we only have three periods of actual game history, I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the recent game-time demand volatility (mean ~100), ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for roughly 500 units of demand. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient pipeline while we wait for the first arrival.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1-4. Demand samples (62, 161, 76, 60) show high volatility (mean=89.75, std=47.9). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With demand samples ranging from 60 to 161, a conservative approach using all available samples is best until the first arrival confirms the lead time. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=4 to capture the most recent demand behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1137.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, an order placed in Period 1 arrived at the start of Period 5 (after 4 periods), confirming the promised lead time L=4. Demand has been relatively consistent over the first 5 periods (62, 161, 76, 60, 64), though Period 2 was an outlier at 161. Excluding Period 2, the average is around 65. Including it, the average is 84.6. Since we have very few data points and one significant outlier, I will use all 5 samples to calculate the mean and standard deviation to ensure the OR backend accounts for the volatility seen in Period 2. The pipeline (In-transit) is 491 units, which covers nearly 6 periods of average demand (84.6 * 5.8), and we have 79 units on hand. The OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent over-ordering if the pipeline is sufficient. I will set L to 'default' (4), and use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full history available.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2004.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6), matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows values: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111. The mean is approximately 89 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 105, and in-transit is 355 (orders from P3, P4, P6). The total pipeline plus on-hand is 460 units. Given L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~89, the required base stock is roughly 445 units plus a safety buffer. Currently, we have 460 units, so the system is well-positioned. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed lead times are consistent. For demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture all available game history samples, as there is no clear regime shift yet beyond standard variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1029.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, and 65. The mean demand across these 7 samples is 85.57 with a standard deviation of 36.65. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving exactly in P5, P6, and P7. Currently, on-hand inventory is 206 and in-transit is 322 (representing orders from P4, P6, and P7). Pipeline inventory is healthy. Given the lead time L=4, the OR backend needs to cover a (L+1)=5 period horizon. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the full recent history since the start, which effectively acts as the current demand regime. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am currently at the start of Period 9. Looking at the history, orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 have all arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but no clear trend yet, with samples: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (pre-game) and 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123 (game history). The average demand over these 13 samples is approximately 93.6 units. My current on-hand inventory is 271, and in-transit is 173 (Orders from P6, P7, P8). Given L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods of demand (93.6 * 5 = 468). The current pipeline (271+173=444) is close to this target. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time as it is stable at 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (default) as there is no clear regime shift yet, allowing the OR backend to balance the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 5 through 8 confirm a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods. In Period 9, no units arrived, which is expected since no units were ordered in Period 5. The pipeline (In-transit) is 306 units, consisting of orders from Period 6 (1 unit), Period 7 (133 units), Period 8 (39 units), and Period 9 (133 units). Demand has been relatively stable, with recorded values: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123, 104. The mean demand across all 9 periods is approximately 91.78 units, and the standard deviation is approximately 35.15. Given that L=4, the review plus lead time window is 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=9 capturing all data points to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively provides a smoothed projection for the upcoming cycle while keeping the lead time at the confirmed value of 4.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the first 10 periods. Calculating the demand mean from the provided history (including the seed samples and observed demand from P1-P10), the average demand is approximately 96 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P5 through P10). Currently, there is a gap in arrivals: orders from P5 (0 units) and P6 (1 unit) means very little inventory arrived in P10. The P7 order (133 units) is expected to arrive in P11 (which we will see in the P12 start). With On-hand at 77 and In-transit at 421, the system needs to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand captures the current stable regime. For lead time, 'calculate' is appropriate as observations consistently match the promised 4 periods.

The carry-over insight and execution history confirm a consistent lead time of 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11). The absence of an arrival in Period 9 is consistent with the decision to order 0 units in Period 5. Currently, we have 142 units on-hand and 371 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since the lead time L=4 is stable and the demand shows no clear seasonal trend or shift in the last 11 periods, I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=11 to capture the full stable regime post-initialization. This balances the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio of 19:1) while utilizing the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 93 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which aligns with all historical observations (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have all arrived exactly after 4 periods). Note that the Period 5 order was 0 units, explaining why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 9 conclude message. Demand has remained relatively stable; the last 12 periods show a mean of 90.25 units (range: 60-161). The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high ($19:$1), suggesting a high service level (~95%) is optimal. My current pipeline inventory is 386 units (orders from P9-P12), and given the lead time L=4, my parameters will target a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=12 for demand parameters to capture the full observed history of demand, while using 'default' for lead time since the promised 4 remains accurate.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals from periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 all arriving exactly 4 periods later (note: Period 5 had an order of 0). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability without significant regime shifts. Over the first 13 periods, demand averages approximately 93.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. Given the stable environment, I will use a recent history (N=8) to capture the current demand mean and variance while filtering out the initial noise. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is appropriately set to maximize profit while managing holding costs.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 15. The promised lead time (L) of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable; over the last 14 periods, the mean is approximately 97 units. There is a slight uptick in demand recently (Period 13: 106, Period 14: 140), but not yet enough to confirm a sustained regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand average (mean \u2248 97.9, std \u2248 23.3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the stable history with the recent minor increase. Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 312) plus On-hand (96) totals 408 units, which covers approximately 4.1 periods of current average demand. Since lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 490 units) to maintain the service level.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the 15-period history. The mean demand across all observed periods (excluding those with truncated sales) is approximately 98.5. The promised lead time (L=4) has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders from periods 1 through 11 (all showing exactly 4 periods). However, there is a missing shipment from Period 5. The order placed in Period 5 was for 0 units (calculated by the backend), which explains why no shipment 'concluded' in Period 9, though the 'arrival resolution phase' still correctly reflects the timeline. On-hand inventory is 80 units, and there are 368 units in-transit (orders from periods 12, 13, 14, 15), covering the pipeline. I will continue using L=4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most representative recent behavior, avoiding the early noisy startup periods while ensuring enough data for a stable forecast. This balances the service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2546.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand surged to 227 units, which is significantly higher than the previous historical average (approx. 90-100 units). On-hand inventory hit zero, and 93 units of demand were lost. Currently, at Period 17, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 449 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect the following arrivals: 82 units (ordered P13) in P17 resolution, 93 units (ordered P14) in P18 resolution, 139 units (ordered P15) in P19 resolution, and 135 units (ordered P16) in P20 resolution. Because demand appears to have shifted to a higher regime (~227 in P16, though historical samples vary), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this recent volatility while respecting the longer-term mean. The current lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in Period 16 (227 units vs avg ~95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for the last two periods (P16: 227, P17: 186) is significantly higher than the previous average of ~95. This has resulted in stockouts (ending inventory = 0 for P16 and P17). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have a clear regime shift, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture the current mean demand of 206.5 units. For mu_hat, this translates to (1+L) * 206.5 = 1032.5. For sigma_hat, I will use explicit values to reflect the high volatility (std dev of [227, 186] is ~29, so sqrt(5)*29 is ~65) and add a buffer for the stockout risk. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that prioritizes filling backorders and meeting the new demand level while considering the 593 units currently in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean demand increased from ~95 to ~205 (+115%).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 227, 186, and 210, averaging approximately 207.7 units per period. This is a significant jump from the previous average of ~95 units. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 16, we have experienced stockouts because the preceding orders were sized for the lower demand regime. As a result, our on-hand inventory is 0. Recent orders (P17: 226, P18: 266) are scaling up, but we must maintain these high parameters to ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders to cover the (L+1) window (5 periods). I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new mean (~1038.5 for 5 periods) and sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 227, 186, 210, and 171 respectively, with an average of 198.5. This is significantly higher than the pre-P16 average of ~95. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts for the past four periods. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have shifted to a new demand regime, I will use a window of N=4 (the duration of the current regime) to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the OR backend. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent high-volume trend rather than the lower historical average, helping to mitigate the stockout situation as new orders arrive.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the mean demand was approximately 93 units. From Period 16 to Period 20, the average demand spiked to 200.6 units (samples: 227, 186, 210, 171, 209). This represents a sustained increase of over 115%. Currently, the system is stock-out (on-hand: 0) because arrivals (based on orders placed before the shift) are insufficient to meet this new demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To stabilize inventory and meet the higher service level required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the characteristics of this new elevated demand regime. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent history of 4-period lead times.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~198.3 over the last 6 periods (P16-P21 demand: 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 17, our orders have scaled up significantly (average order ~214) to meet this new demand. The L value is kept at 4 (promised). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new demand regime (Periods 16-21). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=6 to reflect the higher volatility of this new regime. On-hand inventory is currently low (39) because we are recovering from several periods of stockouts while waiting for the larger orders placed after the shift to arrive. The large in-transit balance (859) reflects these necessary pending arrivals.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. In the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged approximately 194.7 units (227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173), compared to the earlier average of ~95 units. To ensure the base-stock level reflects this higher demand level, I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods according to carry-over insights and recent arrival data (P21 and P22 both shows lead_time was 4 periods). This ensures we buffer for (L+1) = 5 periods of the higher demand regime while catching up from stockouts experienced between P16 and P20.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~200. Since Period 16, demand has been consistent with this new level (P16-P23: 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205), with a mean of 196. Standard deviation in this regime (N=8) is approximately 19. Lead time is stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages (P17-P23). In-transit inventory (677) plus on-hand (169) currently equals 846 units, which roughly covers 4.3 periods of demand at the current rate (~196). To ensure we maintain the service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this specific regime. This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that accounts for the current higher mean and volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 units to ~195 units. The last 9 periods (P16-P24) show a stable but much higher demand mean of 197.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments. To account for this new higher demand regime while minimizing the risk of stockouts (which were frequent between P16 and P20), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the behavior of the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the OR backend uses the observed historical lead time of 4. This configuration targets a high service level appropriate for the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~190 units per period. The recent 10 periods (P16-P25) show demand values of 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205, 158, and 184, resulting in a mean of 191.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., P25 arrival was ordered at P21). To maintain the required service level (target cycle service level ~95% given profit $19 vs holding $1) under this higher demand and higher volatility regime, I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift behavior accurately. The lead time L is set to calculate to reflect the stable 4-period observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4032.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 193.5 units per period, which is a substantial increase (+103%) from the early period average (P1-P15) of approximately 95 units. The standard deviation has also stabilized at a higher level during this new regime. Lead times have remained remarkably consistent at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8, 10-15, and 20-26). Currently, we have 129 units on-hand and 686 units in-transit. To maintain a high service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the most recent 11 periods (P16-P26) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as these accurately reflect the current demand level and volatility. L will be set to the calculated historical average since it aligns perfectly with the promised lead time of 4.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~190. Analysis of the 12 periods since the shift (P16-P27) shows a mean demand of 194.08 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21.0 units. The lead time has remained consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals through Period 27). Current on-hand inventory is 85 and in-transit is 760. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring the 'base_stock' target (which covers L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current average demand of ~194 per period (Total mu_hat \u2248 970).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to approximately 193.5 units per period (average of the last 13 periods: 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205, 158, 184, 219, 200, 180). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (as shown by recent concluding arrivals from Periods 20-24). Currently, for Period 29, we have 112 units on-hand and 756 units in-transit (orders from Periods 25-28). With an average demand of ~194, the pipeline inventory covers approximately 4 periods of demand, which is appropriate for a 4-period lead time. I will continue to use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime while maintaining a stable forecast that accounts for the increased service level needs (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~95 to ~195 units per period. Over the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the mean demand is 196.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 21.6. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the game history. At the start of Period 30, we have 48 units on hand and 782 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P26-P29). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent demand regime (last 14 samples), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=14 to ensure the ordering logic accounts for this higher sustained demand while maintaining the stabilized lead time estimate.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~95 to ~205 units. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P16 to P30), the average demand is approximately 195.5 units, which remains consistent with the previous 'Period 18' insight. Lead times have been consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded deliveries. Inventory levels are extremely low (on-hand = 1), but there is a significant pipeline (822 units), with 230 units (ordered Period 27) expected to arrive in Period 31. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. For lead time, I will stick with the 'calculate' method as it has stabilized at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~95 to ~195 units per period. Over the last 15 periods (P17-P31), the mean demand is 195.9 and the standard deviation is approximately 21.6. Monitoring the recent lead times, orders have consistently arrived with a lead time of 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My target base stock should be calculated based on this high-demand regime to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 16-20. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture this sustained high-demand behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high profit per unit ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a high service level.

The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a mean of ~95 to ~195. Over the last 17 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is 195.35 and the standard deviation is approximately 22.3. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (e.g., P28 order arrived in P32). On-hand inventory is low (46), but there is a substantial pipeline (776 units), which is appropriate given the 4-period lead time and 195 average demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed stability.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 33, the mean is approximately 195 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 22 units. Currently, the system is in Period 34. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrival data). I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=18, covering the entire high-demand regime from Period 16 to 33. This ensures the OR backend uses the updated mean and variance while factoring in the 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is low (49), but pipeline inventory is high (834), which aligns with the cycle of high demand and regular arrivals. The chosen parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1).

I will use N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining a stable forecast. L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time average. This setup targets a high service level (z* ~ 1.64 for 95% service) which is appropriate given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, increasing from ~95 to ~197 units per period. Since Period 16, demand has remained stable with a mean of 197.35 and a standard deviation of 22.08. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-35). Current on-hand inventory is 60 and in-transit is 789. Using the regime starting at Period 16 provides N=20 samples. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~987 units). I'll use method 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand period accurately while ignoring the lower pre-Period 16 data.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~198. Over the last 21 periods (P16-P36), mean demand is 198.3 and standard deviation is 23.9. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 36 demand (237) exceeded available stock (216). There are 850 units in-transit, which aligns with recent order history (Periods 33, 34, 35, 36). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the demand has been stable at this higher level for over 20 periods, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture this regime's mean and volatility while excluding the pre-shift data. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the elevated demand and provides a sufficient safety buffer to prevent stockouts like the one observed in Period 36.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~95 to ~200. Over the last 20 periods (P18-P37), the mean demand is approximately 199.5. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods as promised. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (23 units) but in-transit inventory is high (840 units), which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate (840 / 200 = 4.2). To maintain appropriate stock levels considering the 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 20-period window to capture the current regime's behavior. The service level target (critical ratio) is high (19/20 = 0.95), so capturing recent volatility is important to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3610.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the on-hand inventory is 0 for the second period in a row due to the sustained high demand regime (~200 units/period) that began in Period 16. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the continuous arrival of orders from P30-P34. To satisfy demand and minimize stockouts given the high profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), the OR backend needs to maintain a robust base stock. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 (covering the start of the regime shift at P16 to the most recent P38) to accurately capture the current mean of ~200.5 and the observed volatility. This ensures the pipeline inventory target reflects the (L+1) window (5 periods of demand) effectively.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~95 to ~200+. Analyzing the most recent 24 periods (P16-P39), the mean demand is approximately 201.2 units with a standard deviation of 23.3. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply in recent periods (P36, P38, P39 had lost sales). With a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the recent mean demand of ~201 and the observed volatility to set the OR parameters, ensuring the base stock level (mu_hat + safety stock) is sufficient to recover from the current stockout and meet the 95% service level implicit in the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to approximately 203 units per period. The standard deviation in this new regime (Periods 16-40) is roughly 23 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 869 units in transit. Since Period 36, several periods have seen stockouts or near-zero ending inventory (Periods 36, 38, 39, 40), suggesting the current base-stock level is barely covering mean demand and leaving no safety stock for higher-than-average demand spikes (like the 239 units in Period 39). To ensure higher service levels and account for the high cost of lost sales ($19) versus holding cost ($1), I will use the recent regime (last 25 periods) for both mean and volatility. This will stabilize the forecast around the 200+ unit average and provide a more accurate safety stock buffer for the current demand environment.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a mean of ~95 to ~205. Calculating the specific mean for the current regime (P16 to P41) shows a mean demand of approximately 203.4 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. Although the system has been running close to zero inventory and experiencing frequent stockouts, order arrivals from Period 35 onwards (captured in concludes P39-P41) have stabilized at a higher level (avg ~224). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting parameters to use the recent 26 periods (the length of the current high-demand regime) to capture this higher mean and volatility accurately, ensuring the base stock level (1+L) * mean is sufficient to return to a positive on-hand inventory position while accounting for the current zero-inventory state and high in-transit volume.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current demand regime discovered at Period 16 (mean ~205) continues to hold. Demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) averages 211.5 units, slightly higher than the average of the whole regime (P16-P42: ~198.5). Observed lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. With only 44 units on-hand and a high 'In-transit' balance (885 units), including the Period 39 order (194 units) expected this period and the Period 40 order (240 units) expected in Period 44, we need to maintain a high base stock to avoid the recurring stockouts seen in Periods 36-41. I am setting mu_hat using the last 20 samples to capture the high-demand regime while smoothing recent fluctuations. sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 20 periods to reflect the current volatility (std ~22). Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4 as actuals consistently match this.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4522.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to approximately 205. In the most recent 10-period window (Periods 34-43), the average demand has further stabilized around 218.4, with a recent spike to 250 in Period 43. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a robust pipeline of 872 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) will capture this stabilized high-demand regime, while sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) will account for the current volatility. This configuration helps the OR engine maintain a high service level for the increased demand while ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) is appropriately sized to avoid stockouts which have occurred recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher mean of ~218 units based on Periods 34-43 (+130% from original mean).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable around a mean of ~218 units since Period 34. However, the last two periods (43 and 44) showed slightly higher demand (250 and 235), leading to stockouts or near-zero ending inventory. To maintain a sufficient service level and avoid further stockouts, I am using a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=11 (covering Periods 34-44) captures the current stabilized higher demand regime while including the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the historical arrival patterns. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period, ensuring the pipeline covers expected demand plus a safety stock buffer.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime, with the most recent 10-period average (Periods 36-45) being approximately 218 units/period. The current inventory position is very lean, with only 41 units on-hand and an ending inventory of 41 in Period 45. While there is a substantial pipeline of 924 units, the lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit margins ($19) relative to holding costs ($1), it is optimal to maintain a high service level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture this stable, high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for recent volatility (approximate std dev ~24) and mean demand. This strategy aims to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 36, 38, 39, 41, and 43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4214.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 34. Analyzing demand from Periods 34 to 46 (13 samples), the mean is approximately 215.7 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 22.3. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture this stable high-demand regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods) using the most relevant recent statistics. The current in-transit inventory is high (915 units), which the OR backend will subtract from the calculated base stock to determine the final order quantity, helping to avoid overstocking as the game nears its end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3857.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 34-47) shows a stable mean of approximately 213 units, with occasional peaks up to 250. Period 47's demand was 204. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs on the final day. Current on-hand is low (19), but there is a significant pipeline (954 units). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce orders as the pipeline is full. I'm using 'recent_N' with N=14 to reflect the demand regime since Period 34, and 'calculate' for lead time since it has been stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3202.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~218 units since Period 34. Recent demand in Periods 44-48 (235, 190, 224, 204, 174) yields an average of 205.4, suggesting the regime remains consistent with the higher levels established mid-game. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 1 period remaining in the simulation (Period 50), the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 104 and in-transit is 891. Since we are at Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (L=4) will not arrive before the game ends. However, the objective remains to set parameters that reflect the current regime. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the stable high-demand period (Periods 34-48) while providing sufficient historical data for variance calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3017.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable since the last identified regime shift around Period 34. Analyzing the demand from Period 34 to 49, the mean is approximately 210 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 194 units, with 799 units in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 48, and 49). To calculate the base stock level, I will use the recent demand history from the stable regime (N=16, from Period 34 to 49) to inform \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This ensures that the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is calculated against the most relevant demand pattern (~1050 units for mu_hat), while the OR backend manages the safety stock via the service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95.
