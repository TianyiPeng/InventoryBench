We have no calendar dates provided, so I will rely on the provided historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96). Disregarding the potential outlier of 36 in Period 2, the average demand is approximately 105. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My ordering strategy must cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. To meet the expected demand of ~105 per period over the next 5 periods, I need to establish a pipeline. I will place an initial large order to secure stock for when the lead time elapses. A target of 525 units (105 * 5) is appropriate to cover the pipeline, but I will order slightly more to account for potential variance, aiming for roughly 550 total units in the system.",

In Period 1, actual demand was 62 units, resulting in 0 sales due to 0 starting inventory. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variance (105, 36, 108, 110, 96). Given the lead time of 4 periods, my safety stock needs to cover at least 5 periods of demand (Periods 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). Looking at the historical samples, the average demand is approximately 91 units per period. Five periods of average demand equals roughly 455 units. I currently have 550 units in transit from Period 1, which should arrive in Period 5. To ensure coverage through Period 6 (the first period reachable by a Period 2 order), I calculate the required pipeline. Total demand expected over 5 periods (P2-P6) is ~455-500 units. Since 550 units are already in the pipeline and expected at P5, I have sufficient coverage for the immediate lead time window. However, to maintain a steady flow and account for the high demand variance (62 in P1 history vs 105 P1 sample), I will place a small supplemental order to buffer against future stockouts once the P1 order arrives.",

As of Period 44, on-hand inventory is 91. The pipeline includes orders from Periods 40 (270), 41 (200), 42 (200), and 43 (200), totaling 870 units in-transit. The order from P40 is expected to arrive during Period 44 (becoming available for P45). To maintain a service level covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (approx 1,025 units), I need to account for current inventory and the pipeline. On-hand (91) + In-transit (870) = 961 units. To reach the target of ~1,025, an order of 65-100 units would suffice. However, looking at the game's end at Period 50, I must avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods while ensuring enough stock for the remaining 6 active demand periods (P44-P49). Total expected demand for P44-P50 is ~1,435 units. Total units already committed: 91 + 870 = 961. Remaining units needed for the whole game: ~474. Placing an order of 150 ensures we don't stock out if demand spikes towards the end, while remaining mindful of the 50-period limit.",

Therefore, placing additional orders is unnecessary as they will not arrive in time to satisfy any demand or contribute to profit before the game ends. My current inventory assessment shows 108 units on-hand and 565 units in-transit. Based on the lead time of 4 periods, the arrivals for Period 48, 49, and 50 are already determined by orders placed in Periods 44, 45, and 46. Specifically, Period 48 will see 150 units arrive (from P44), Period 49 will see 415 units arrive (from P45), and Period 50 will see 0 units arrive (from P46).

My objective is to determine an order for Period 49 that maximizes reward by satisfying demand in Period 49 and Period 50, while minimizing leftover inventory at the end of the final period (Period 50). History confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods. Therefore, an order placed in Period 49 (N=49) will arrive in Period 53 (N+L = 49+4). Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now will arrive too late to satisfy any demand or affect the final inventory state. The current inventory pipeline consists of: On-hand (84 units) and In-transit (415 units). Analyzing the In-transit status: Period 45 order (415 units) is expected in Period 49 (45+4). Period 46-48 orders were 0. Thus, for Period 49 arrival resolution, 415 units will arrive. Total inventory for Period 49 will be 84 (starting) + 415 (arrival) = 499 units. Recent demand (P40-P48) has averaged approximately 201 units. Total expected demand for the remaining two periods (P49 and P50) is ~402 units. Current inventory of 499 is sufficient to cover this demand. Since any order placed today will not arrive before the game ends, the order quantity should be 0 to avoid unnecessary pipeline costs or complexities, even though it won't impact the terminal period's calculation.",

Additionally, any orders placed in Period 50 will not arrive until Period 54 (given the 4-period lead time), meaning they cannot satisfy Period 50 demand and will simply add to the final cost if they were accounted for. More importantly, the simulation ends after Period 50's demand resolution. Current on-hand inventory is 330 units. The average demand for the 'chips(Regular)' SKU in the current regime (since Period 16) is approximately 201 units. With 330 units on hand, we have more than enough stock to cover the expected demand for this final period (averaging ~200 units, with a historical maximum in this regime of 250 units). Placing an order now is useless for this game's mechanics as it will never arrive in time to be sold.
