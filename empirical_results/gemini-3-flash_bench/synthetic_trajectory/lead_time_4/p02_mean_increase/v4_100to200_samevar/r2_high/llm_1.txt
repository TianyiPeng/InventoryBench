The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that this order was placed and 83 units of demand occurred, but since the order has a promised lead time of 4 periods, it has not arrived yet, resulting in 0 sales and 0 ending inventory. Looking at the five historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), the average demand is approximately 91 units per period. The Period 1 demand (83) is consistent with this range. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, an order placed in Period N arrives in Period N+4 and becomes visible for the Period N+5 decision. My current total pipeline (On-hand 0 + In-transit 525) covers approximately 5.7 periods of average demand (525 / 91). Given that the pipeline needs to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), the current in-transit amount is sufficient for the immediate lead time window.

  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 200 units per period (moving average over the last 10 periods is ~198). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. My objective is to maintain a pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) sufficient to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean demand of 200, the target pipeline is ~1000 units. Current inventory status: On-hand = 135, In-transit = 650, total = 785. The game ends at Period 50. Considering the 1-period reporting delay and the 4-period lead time, orders placed in Period 44 will arrive in Period 48 and be visible in Period 49. Orders placed in Period 45 will arrive in Period 49 and be visible in Period 50. Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends. To bridge the gap between my current pipeline (785) and the required stock to prevent stockouts through Period 49 (at least 200 * 5 = 1000 units), I should order 215 units. Ordering 200 units aligns with the current consumption rate and maintains the necessary buffer.",

There is a projected deficit of ~404 units. Specifically, I need to place an order in P45 to arrive in P49, and in P46 to arrive in P50.

Total expected supply currently in the pipeline plus on-hand is 63 + 200 + 150 + 200 + 200 = 813 units. To cover the total expected demand of ~1,000 units by the end of Period 50, I need an additional ~187 units. Since an order placed now in P46 will arrive in P50 (L=4), this is the last order that will contribute to sold units before the game ends. I will order 200 units to comfortably meet P50 demand while accounting for potential variance, as the profit margin ($19) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1).

Therefore, these orders will only incur costs without providing any benefit to revenue or demand fulfillment. The current inventory position is: On-hand = 125 units, In-transit = 400 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, the arrivals for Period 49 and Period 50 have already been dispatched in previous periods (specifically orders from P45 and P46 are due to arrive during Period 49 and Period 50 respectively).

After the Period 50 demand resolution occurs (estimated at ~190 units based on recent averages), the ending inventory will likely be near zero or slightly negative (stockout), but any new order placed now will not arrive until Period 54.
