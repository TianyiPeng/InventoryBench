I will use a baseline lead-time of 4 periods as promised, targeting coverage for L+1 (5 periods) of demand. Current inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. Projected demand for 5 periods is approximately 500 units.

Total pipeline needed = 5 periods * ~100 units/period = 500 units. Currently, I have 500 units in-transit (from Period 1) and 0 on-hand.

The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (specifically up to Period 43) confirms that actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we are at Period 44 of a 50-period game, we must consider the remaining window. Orders placed now (Period 44) will arrive in Period 48. Orders placed in Period 45 will arrive in Period 49. Orders placed in Period 46 will arrive in Period 50. Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends. Inventory assessment: On-hand is 56. In-transit is 750 (250 from P40, 200 from P41, 200 from P42, 100 from P43). Expected arrivals: P44: 250 (P40), P45: 200 (P41), P46: 200 (P42), P47: 100 (P43). Total stock available to cover demand for Periods 44-47 (4 periods) = 56 (on-hand) + 750 (in-transit) = 806. Total expected demand for Periods 44-47 \u2248 4 * 200 = 800. This looks tight but sufficient for the lead time duration. However, to cover the final three periods (P48, P49, P50), we need stock to arrive in P48. Placing an order of 300 now (P44) to arrive in P48 ensures we aren't stocked out at the very end while minimizing holding costs for the non-arriving tail end.",

Currently, for Period 45, the on-hand inventory is 117 units. The in-transit pipeline contains orders from P41 (200), P42 (200), P43 (100), and P44 (300). With 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), our goal is to minimize ending inventory while avoiding stockouts. The inventory arriving in P45 (from P41) is 200 units, bringing usable stock for the period to 317, which covers the expected ~200 demand. To cover the lead-time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods), we need roughly 1000 units. Total inventory (On-hand 117 + In-transit 800) is 917. An order of 100-200 units will maintain this safety level. However, given we are approaching the end (Period 50), I will target a safety stock level that ensures we don't carry excessive inventory past P50 while respecting the 4-period lead time.",
