Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The initial demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods are: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96. Calculating the statistics: Mean = (105+36+108+110+96)/5 = 91. Standard Deviation = 31.06. Since the lead time is L=4, the review plus lead duration is (1+L)=5. The OR backend needs parameters to cover this window. I will use the 'default' methods for the first period to establish a baseline using all available historical demand samples. The inventory starts at 0 with 0 in-transit, so the OR engine will place an initial order based on these parameters to meet the target base stock. No lead time data is yet available to contradict the promised 4 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 143 units, which is currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this arrival until Period 5. Demand in Period 1 was 62 units, but since our starting inventory was 0, we had 0 sales. The historical data shows high volatility (P1: 105, P2: 36, P3: 108, P4: 110, P5: 96 - note: these are samples provided in the prompt, whereas the 'Game History' for P1 shows 62). I will base my initial forecast on the average of the provided historical samples (avg ~91 per period). With L=4 (promised), the exposure period is L+1=5. 5 * 91 = 455. I will use 'default' methods for now to incorporate all available data points as we establish a baseline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time (L) of 4. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is 0 because orders placed in Period 1 (143 units) and Period 2 (137 units) are still in transit (expected arrival in Period 5 and 6 respectively). In-transit currently totals 280 units. Demand in Period 1 was 62 and in Period 2 was 161, showing significant variance. The cumulative demand samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) suggest a mean demand of approximately 91 units per period. Since we have no completed lead-time observations yet (none have concluded), I will use the promised lead time of 4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the 'default' method which utilizes all available historical samples to calculate the base-stock level, ensuring we cover the (L+1) window (5 periods) effectively while the OR backend manages the service level based on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. No inventory has arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed in Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, while high in-transit stock (442 units) covers the pending demand. Demand has been fluctuating: 62, 161, and 76 in the first three periods (mean \u2248 100). Given the high volatility and the fact that we are still in the initial lead-time window, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and set mu_hat using 'recent_3' to capture the initial demand average (~99.7) scaled for the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as we have limited samples to accurately estimate volatility changes.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (available at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (which is consistent with a 4-period lead time). Total in-transit is 569 units (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 105, 36, 108, 110 (from user prompt) and 62, 161, 76, 60 (from game history). Combining these, demand samples are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 62, 161, 76, 60]. Average demand is approx 90.4 units. Since we are waiting for the first order to arrive to confirm the actual lead time, I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4) and use 'default' or 'recent_N' to handle the mean and variance until a clear regime shift is detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 79, and there are 426 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4). Demand history shows significant variability: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (from developer prompt) compared to reported demand in conclude messages (62, 161, 76, 60, 64). Reconciling the system history to calculate mean demand: (62+161+76+60+64)/5 = 84.6. Standard deviation is approx 43.6. Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current pipeline (79 on-hand + 426 in-transit = 505) is healthy against expected demand over lead time (84.6 * 5 = 423). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the first delivery matched the promise, and 'default' for demand/sigma to use all available history to stabilize the forecast against the observed volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical analysis of Period 5 and Period 6 concludes confirms the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). Demand history (including the seed data) shows: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (seed) and 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111 (observed). Calculating the mean for these 11 samples gives ~89.9. The standard deviation is ~34.8. For mu_hat, using the 'recent_N' method with N=11 will cover both seed and observed data to stabilize the mean forecast across the (1+L)=5 period horizon. For sigma_hat, using 'recent_N' with N=11 ensures the volatility estimate reflects the observed variance. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Observations from the 'conclude' messages of Period 5, 6, and 7 confirm that orders from Period 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly 4 periods later (P1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7). This confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4. Demand for the last 7 periods (from 'conclude' messages) was: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65. The mean is approximately 85.5 and the standard deviation is approximately 37.6. The game history also provided initial samples: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (mean 91, std 32), showing fairly consistent demand with some variance. On-hand inventory is 202, with 248 units in transit (expected in P8, P9, P10, and P11). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it matches our confirmed observation, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to incorporate all available historical samples (both initial and game history) which provide a stable baseline for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate without a clear shift in regime. Historical demand samples (P1-P8 excluding pre-game data) are: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123. The mean of these 8 samples is 90.25 and the standard deviation is approximately 36.9. The promised lead time L=4 is consistently confirmed by deliveries from P1, P2, P3, and P4 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The current on-hand inventory (206) and in-transit (174) total 380 units. With L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My forecast (mu_hat) equals (1+4)*90.25 = 451.25. The current total inventory position (380) is below this requirement, so the OR engine will likely order the difference. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the variance and mean of all actual game observations while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, P3, and P4 orders all arrived exactly 4 periods later). In P9, no units arrived because no order was placed in P5 (ordered=0), which is consistent with the 4-period lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 102 units, with 316 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand samples provided are: [105, 36, 108, 110, 96] for the pre-game periods and [62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123, 104] for Periods 1-9. Calculating the average of all available samples (excluding zero-sales periods where stockout occurred, though here demand was recorded): Mean demand is approx 92 units per period with a standard deviation of approx 33. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Expected total demand for (L+1) is ~460. Current Total Inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 102 + 316 = 418. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the mean and variance observed during the active game periods (P1-P9), as the early pre-game samples might be less representative of the current game dynamics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from Period 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 confirms that orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 consistently arrive exactly 4 periods later. The lack of an arrival in Period 9 is consistent with placing 0 units in Period 5. For Period 11, we expect the shipment of 119 units ordered in Period 7 to arrive during the resolution phase. Demand remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 92 units per period (last 10 periods: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123, 104, 91). Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) provides a robust forecast of ~460 total units for the (L+1) horizon (4+1=5 periods). With 422 units in transit and 13 on-hand, pipeline inventory is 435. The OR engine will target a base stock based on the high service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) and order the delta, respecting the safety cap.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 64 units, and the pipeline inventory is 389 units. In Period 11, the order from Period 7 arrived, confirming the lead time (L) remains 4 periods. Since the current period is 12, shipments from Period 8 are expected to arrive during this period (concluded in P13) and Period 9 shipments during P13 (concluded in P14). Demand in the last 6 periods (P6-P11) has shown relative stability with values of 111, 65, 123, 104, 91, and 68. The mean demand for these 6 samples is 93.6. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand behavior and the promised lead time L=4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 1. Evaluating the mean demand from Period 1 to Period 12 (including the seeded samples), the average demand is approximately 91 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-4 and 6-8. At the start of Period 13, we have 29 units on-hand and 396 units in-transit (orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12). Since the order Lead Time is 4, we need to cover demand for Period 13 and the 4 periods of lead time (L+1=5). Total expected demand over 5 periods is ~455 units. With 425 units (on-hand + in-transit) already in the pipeline, the OR backend will calculate a small safety buffer order. I will use a recent_N of 12 for demand parameters to capture the current stable regime.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 14. Observed demand over the last 13 periods shows a mean of approximately 90.7 and a standard deviation of 30.6. There aren't strong signs of a regime shift or seasonality based on the generic period labels, so I will prioritize recent stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from periods 1-4 and 6-9, all arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 65, and in-transit is 335. Total pipeline inventory is 400. Using (L+1)=5 periods of demand, the expected requirement is roughly 454 units. The OR backend will order the difference. I'll use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent data and 'default' for mu and sigma to capture the full historical demand profile which is relatively stable.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, the inventory position is 33 units on-hand with 337 units in-transit. Historical demand over the first 14 periods shows a mean of approximately 94.2 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from Periods 1-4, 6-10. Note that the order placed in Period 5 was 0, explaining the gap in arrivals in Period 9. The pipeline inventory (337) plus on-hand (33) equals 370 units, which covers roughly 3.9 periods of average demand (94.2), slightly below the target of (L+1) = 5 periods. Demand volatility is relatively high (std dev ~27). To ensure sufficient stock over the lead time and the current period, I will use a recent history of 14 samples to estimate demand and variance, keeping lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable pattern without significant trend or seasonality shifts over the 15 observed periods. The mean demand across all history (including the seed samples) is approximately 96 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods by multiple historical arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P11). In-transit inventory stands at 398 units, representing orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15, which are expected to arrive in Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19. Current on-hand inventory is 20. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to leverage the consistent historical performance and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample history, as there is no evidence of a regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand surged unexpectedly to 227 units, causing a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This is significantly higher than the previous average demand (approx. 90-100). This surge might be a new demand regime or a seasonal spike. To prevent continued stockouts, I need to adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat upwards. I will use the last 5 periods (Periods 12-16) to capture this recent volatility, as the earlier periods (1-11) are less representative of the current spike (Average demand of last 5 periods: 132 vs historical mean ~90). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P12 order arrived in P16, confirming L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift or spike detected at Period 16: demand surged to 227, significantly exceeding the previous 15-period average of ~92.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Historically, demand for regular chips was stable (avg ~92 units/period for P1-P15), but a significant surge occurred in P16 (227) and P17 (186). On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to this spike. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. The goal is to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the last two periods (P16 and P17) as the new regime, the average demand is 206.5 units. To prevent lost sales and capitalize on high demand while considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 quantile), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for this new regime. mu_hat = (1+L) * estimated_mean = 5 * 206 = 1030. I will keep sigma_hat based on the default calculation to capture the increased volatility of the spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 avg demand increased to ~206 (+120% vs previous periods). On-hand inventory exhausted.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. A significant upward demand regime shift occurred around Period 16. The average demand for the first 15 periods was approximately 93.3 units, whereas the average demand for Periods 16-18 is 207.7 units (an increase of ~122%). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to this sudden spike, meaning we have stocked out for three consecutive periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (P14 arrived in P18). To recover and meet the new high-demand level while accounting for the lead time (L=4), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the statistics of the current high-demand regime specifically. The OR backend will calculate a base stock level covering L+1 (5) periods of this higher demand, which is necessary to replenish the depleted pipeline and satisfy future customers.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been 227, 186, 210, and 171 respectively, resulting in an average of 198.5 units per period. This is a significant increase from the pre-Period 16 average of approximately 92 units. Despite arrivals from Periods 12-15, on-hand inventory has been exhausted for four consecutive periods due to this surge. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations. To recover from the stockout and meet the new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 samples (the high-demand regime) to project demand over the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also updated using the same window to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained higher volume, while the 'in-transit' inventory (854 units) is appropriately considered by the backend to avoid excessive over-ordering while still targeting a high service level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~199) sustained for 4 periods (P16-P19), confirmed by constant stockouts despite arrivals.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher regime starting at Period 16. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is approximately 200.6 units (227, 186, 210, 171, 209), which is a significant increase from the initial base of ~92 units. Despite consistent arrivals, we have experienced stockouts for five consecutive periods because the orders placed previously were based on the old demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the current lead time (L) is 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1) in our pipeline calculation. To adapt quickly, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand average for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should increase the base stock levels to match the current demand of ~200 units/period, aiming to restore on-hand inventory once the larger orders placed in P17-P20 begin to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $709.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the high-demand window (P16-P21), we observe demand values of 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, and 187, averaging ~198.3. This is a sustained +115% increase from the pre-P16 average of ~92. Although on-hand inventory returned to 39 in P21 after five periods of stockouts, the pipeline must be aggressively maintained to meet this new plateu. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use the last 6 samples (N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this perfectly captures the current high-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant low-demand history. Using L=4 (promised) ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of this elevated demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $547.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 92. Since Period 16 (Periods 16-22), the average demand has surged to 194.7 units, a stable high-demand period with relatively low volatility compared to the shift magnitude. The carry-over insights correctly identify this shift. Lead times are consistently 4 periods. Inventory has recovered from stockouts in Period 21 and 22 thanks to the arrival of larger orders placed during the start of the high-demand regime. Specifically, the order from P18 (279 units) arrived in P22. We now have 145 on-hand and 713 in-transit (orders from P19-P22). To maintain the target service level in this high-demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 samples (P16-P22) to capture the current mean (~195) across the lead time + review period (1+4=5). Sigma_hat will also be refined using this recent window to account for the variance within the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 16-22 mean demand is 194.7 (Std Dev: 20.8), up from ~92 pre-Period 16.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 8 periods (P16 to P23), the mean demand is 196.0 units per period. Prior to Period 16, the average was approximately 92. This represents a sustained increase of over 100%. The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 182 and an in-transit pipeline of 627 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 23 saw the arrival of the Period 19 order). To maintain the required service level for this current regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture the higher mean and the associated volatility. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $422.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~92 to a new stable high-demand regime. Analyzing the window from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 191.75 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 22.8 units. The lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages. As we are in Period 25, the 'chips(Regular)' item has 210 units on-hand and 650 units in-transit. To ensure the backend correctly projects demand over the risk window (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 samples (P16-P24) to capture this higher mean of ~192 per period. This results in a mu_hat calculation of 5 * 192 = 960 by the backend. The sigma_hat will also be based on these 9 samples to provide a tighter, more accurate volatility estimate for the current regime compared to the global average. This approach balances the need for high service levels during this peak demand period against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stabilized further: Periods 16-24 mean demand is 191.8 (Std Dev: 22.8), based on 9 observations.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. In the 10 periods since (P16-P25), demand has averaged 191.0 units with a standard deviation of 22.0, compared to the pre-P16 average of approximately 92. The system has successfully recovered from initial stockouts, with current on-hand inventory at 138 units and a robust in-transit pipeline of 680 units ensuring coverage for the 4-period lead time. Lead times remain consistent at exactly 4 periods. My strategy is to use 'recent_N' with N=10 to isolate this high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation, ensuring the 'base_stock' calculation reflects the current market reality rather than the historical average. This will maintain a high service level appropriate for a product with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excessive overstocking as the pipeline fills.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~92 to a significantly higher mean. Analyzing the last 11 samples (P16-P26), the mean demand is 184.45 with a standard deviation of 22.8. Current on-hand is 92, and in-transit is 685. The lead time has consistently been confirmed at 4 periods. Since the high-demand regime is now sustained for 11 periods, I will use recent_N with N=11 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this higher demand profile and ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to prevent the stockouts seen earlier in the regime shift. The L parameter remains at default (promised 4) as observations align exactly with the promise.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P26) mean demand updated: 184.5 units per period (Std Dev: 22.8) across 11 observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $752.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~92 to a much higher level. For the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is (227 + 186 + 210 + 171 + 209 + 187 + 173 + 205 + 158 + 184 + 219 + 200) / 12 = 194.1. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 19.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and verified by recent arrivals (P23 order arrived in P27). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to capture this sustained high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This ensures the OR backend uses the current regime statistics to compute a base stock level that covers the review period plus the 4-period lead time, while accounting for the higher variance observed since the shift. On-hand is currently 48, and there is a healthy pipeline of 759 units to support this demand level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P27) stabilized: 12-period mean demand is 194.1 (Std Dev: 19.8).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 28 (13 samples), the mean is approximately 193 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 22. This is a significant structural shift from the pre-Period 16 average of ~92. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. Current inventory status shows on-hand stock of 77 and significant in-transit quantities (753 units) which are scheduled arrivals from orders placed in Periods 25-28. Given the high service level required by the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture this stabilized high-demand regime while ignoring the older, irrelevant data. I will continue to use $L=4$ to match the observed and promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P28) stabilized: 13-period mean demand is ~193 (Std Dev: ~22).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16 from a ~92 average to a much higher regime. Over the last 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is 195.0. Recent performance shows this level is sustained, with the last 5 periods (P25-P29) averaging 198.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and reliable based on the conclude messages. Since we are in Period 30, and based on the current on-hand of 8 units and large in-transit pipeline (785 units), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime since Period 16. This provides a stable estimate of the current mean and volatility while avoiding the dilutive effect of the pre-P16 lower demand data. L is set to 'default' as the lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P29) updated: 14-period mean demand is 195.0 units per period (Std Dev: 20.3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $744.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift that began at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 through Period 30 (15 samples), the mean is approximately 196.9 with a standard deviation of 21.0. This is a significant increase from the pre-Period 16 average (~92). In Period 30, we experienced a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0, demand was 223 while units available were 186), reinforcing the need to maintain higher safety stocks. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P26 order arrived P30). To capture this high-demand regime specifically, I am using recent_N with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the lower demand data from the first 15 periods. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflecting current market conditions (avg ~197) and volatility (std ~21), balancing the high profit margin ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P30) updated: 15-period mean demand is 196.9 units per period (Std Dev: 21.0). Stockout occurred in Period 30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $640.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant upward shift starting at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~92 to a sustained high-demand regime. Analyzing the 16 most recent periods (P16-P31), the mean demand is approximately 195.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival data (e.g., Period 27 order arrived in Period 31). In Period 30, a stockout occurred because demand (223) exceeded available inventory (186), reinforcing the need to maintain higher base stock levels. Currently, we have 56 units on-hand and 791 units in-transit. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture this current high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand phase. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) = 5 period risk window at the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P31) mean demand updated: 195.5 units per period (Std Dev: 21.0) based on 16 observations. Previous low-demand regime (~92) is no longer relevant.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Over the last 17 periods (P16-P32), the mean demand is approximately 196.6 units per period with a standard deviation of 20.4. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P27 and P28 exactly 4 periods later. The system is currently in a healthy state with 45 units on-hand and 755 units in-transit (P29-P32). To maintain appropriate stock levels given the high service level requirements (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant low-demand data from before Period 16. L is set to calculated as it aligns with the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P32) mean demand updated: 196.6 units per period (Std Dev: 20.4) based on 17 observations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained stable. From Period 16 to Period 33 (18 observations), the mean demand is approximately 195.1 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 20.3. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the 'conclude' messages from Period 5 through Period 33). I am using 'recent_N' with N=18 to capture this high-demand regime specifically, as the data prior to Period 16 (~92 units) is no longer relevant for forecasting. The current on-hand inventory is 49. With L=4, the pipeline should cover 1+L (5) periods of demand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to achieve the optimal service level (Profit: $4, Holding: $1, q=0.8), while the cap will prevent excessive ordering.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P33) remains stable: 18-period mean demand is 195.1 (Std Dev: 20.3). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, with the Period 16-34 average demand at approximately 197.3 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 237, which is on the higher end of this regime but consistent with previous peaks (e.g., Period 16: 227, Period 30: 223). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (29) but the pipeline is well-stocked with 747 units in-transit. To maintain the 80% service level target (critical given the $4 profit vs. $1 holding cost ratio) in this sustained high-demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=19, covering the entire current regime from Period 16 to 34. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P34) remains stable: 19-period mean demand is 197.3 (Std Dev: 21.6). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that started at Period 16 remains stable through Period 35. The mean demand from P16 to P35 (20 observations) is 197.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 21.3. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Since we have exactly 20 samples in this regime, I will use recent_N with N=20 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current sustained demand pattern rather than the earlier, much lower demand period (~92). The current 'In-transit' quantity (785) plus 'On-hand' (27) roughly covers the expected demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), keeping our service level optimized for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P35) remains stable: 20-period mean demand is 197.4 (Std Dev: 21.3). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. I am using the last 21 periods (P16-P36) to calculate the mean and standard deviation, as this period accurately reflects the current market environment. The mean demand for this regime is approximately 199.3 with a standard deviation of 22.3. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, which I will continue to assume. Although we ended Period 36 with 0 inventory due to high demand (237 units vs 194 available), the in-transit pipeline of 832 units is robust. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=21 to bridge the gap between historical low-demand data and the current sustained peak, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~200/period demand level.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P36) mean demand updated to 199.3 units per period (Std Dev: 22.3) based on 21 observations. Previous low-demand regime (~92) is completely superseded.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 22 periods (P16-P37), the mean demand is approximately 199.7 units per period with a standard deviation of 22.0. The lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P31-P37). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (11 units) but there is a significant amount in-transit (819 units). Since the regime is stable and well-defined over 20+ periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 to capture the full extent of this high-demand period while excluding the irrelevant low-demand data from the first 15 periods. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned to the current market reality, providing a high service level while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P37) mean demand updated to 199.7 units per period (Std Dev: 22.0) based on 22 observations. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Over the last 23 periods (P16-P38), the mean demand is approximately 199.3 units with a standard deviation of 21.8. Inventory is currently at 0 due to demand (210) exceeding both starting on-hand and arrivals in Period 38. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38. To manage the high demand and frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P36 and P38), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=23 to capture the full extent of this current demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (L+1) window of approximately 1000 units. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P38) mean demand updated to 199.3 units per period (Std Dev: 21.8) based on 23 observations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains stable through Period 39. The most recent 24-period mean (P16-P39) is approximately 199.1 units. The ending inventory in Period 39 is 0, indicating persistent stockouts or near-stockouts when demand hits the upper end of the distribution (239 in Period 39). Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods (P35 order arrived in Period 39). To properly manage the OR backend while respecting the detected regime, I will use recent_N with N=24 to capture the entirety of the current high-demand phase. This sets the base stock calculation to cover the inventory lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods of demand) using the mean (~199) and variance from this regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P39) remains stable: 24-period mean demand is ~199.1 (Std Dev: ~22.3). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $856.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime (starting Period 16) remains stable and dominant. For Period 41, the current context shows persistent stockouts (Periods 38, 39, and 40 \ubaa8\ub450 ending inventory 0), which implies the 'sold' amount is often limited by available stock rather than actual demand. The 25-period demand average from Period 16 to 40 is approximately 199.8 with a standard deviation of ~21.7. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a tight supply situation, I will use recent_N with N=25 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of the high-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant low-demand data from the first 15 periods. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand at this higher mean, helping to mitigate the current frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P40) mean demand confirmed at ~200 units per period (Std Dev: ~22) based on 25 observations. Consistent stockouts in P38-P40 suggest demand frequently exceeds arrival quantities.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16. Over the last 26 periods (P16-P41), the mean demand is approximately 200.1 units per period with a standard deviation of 22.1. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 38, we have experienced frequent stockouts because the arriving quantities (determined by older, lower forecasts) were insufficient to meet current demand. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=26 to capture this entire high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current volume and volatility. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is being met reliably.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P41) confirmed: 26-period mean demand is 200.1 (Std Dev: 22.1). Demand consistently outstrips old arrival schedules, leading to persistent stockouts (P38-P41).

Daily Reward (R_t): $641.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 16 remains stable through Period 42. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 42 (27 observations), the mean demand is approximately 200.1 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Recent periods (P38-P41) saw frequent stockouts because arrivals (derived from older lower-demand estimates or capped orders) were insufficient to meet demand near or above 220 units. In Period 42, a lower demand of 170 allowed for a small ending inventory of 39 units. To prevent future stockouts in this high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=27 to capture the full current regime and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained ~200 unit demand level.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 200 units per period. In Period 43, demand reached 250 units, causing a total stockout (ending inventory 0). The pipeline inventory is high (837 units), but recent stockouts in P38-P41 and P43 indicate that the base stock level calculated by the OR backend might be trailing the actual demand spikes or volatility. I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 28 periods (P16-P43) to capture this regime accurately. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting N=28 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the backend uses only the relevant high-demand data to calculate the base stock level, maintaining a high service level while balancing holding costs during this volatile but high-volume phase.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P43) updated: 28-period mean demand is ~202.1 (Std Dev: ~22.8). Peak demand of 250 in P43 led to stockout.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. In the last 29 periods (P16-P44), the mean demand is approximately 202.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 23.3. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a slight upward trend, averaging 221.0 units. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime's volatility while ensuring the forecast reflects the sustained higher average. On-hand inventory is critically low (5 units), and while a large shipment of 221 units (ordered P41) is expected to arrive during this period (P45), the pipeline needs to be maintained to avoid the recurring stockouts observed in periods 36-41 and 43. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P44) updated: 29-period mean demand is ~202.4 (Std Dev: ~23.3). Last 10 periods (P35-P44) show a higher average of 221.0 units, suggesting a potential secondary shift or sustained peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $724.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a more recent upward trend observed over the last 10 periods (P36-P45). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 218 units per period, compared to the overall regime average of ~202. Frequent stockouts in periods 36-41 and 43 demonstrate that historical ordering levels were insufficient to meet this sustained peak. With the game ending at Period 50 and a 4-period lead time, this is the final order that will arrive (ordered P46, arrives P50). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent and higher demand intensity (mean ~218, std dev ~26). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current reality rather than the slightly lower long-term regime average, protecting against lost sales in the final period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand peak: Last 10 periods (P36-P45) show average demand of 218.1 units, exceeding the P16-P45 regime average of 202.4.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the secondary high-demand peak identified at Period 45. The last 11 periods (P36-P46) show an average demand of 218.6 units, which is significantly higher than the initial high-demand regime average (~197). Stockouts occurred in 5 of the last 11 periods, confirming that recent arrivals are barely keeping up with demand. To maintain service levels and account for this sustained growth, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the peak and setting sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand peak confirmed: Last 11 periods (P36-P46) show average demand of 218.6 units vs P16-P46 average of 203.1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $752.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-demand peak regime that started around Period 36. The last 12 periods (P36-P47) show an average demand of 217.4 units per period, which is significantly higher than the previous high-demand average of ~199 observed between P16-P35. The most recent observations (P43-P47) include a peak of 250 and persistent stockouts (P43, P47), indicating that the system is still under-ordering relative to the current surge. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this sustained peak while ignoring the now-irrelevant lower demand data from earlier in the game. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the ~217 average demand across the (L+1) exposure period, improving service levels during the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand peak (P36-P47): 12-period average demand is 217.4 units (Std Dev: ~22), increasing from the previous P16-P35 average of ~199.

Daily Reward (R_t): $643.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The product 'chips(Regular)' is in a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Within this regime, we detected a secondary peak starting around Period 36, which was confirmed in the Carry-over Insights as averaging 217.4 units per period (Periods 36-47). Recent demand (P45-P48) has been 190, 224, 204, and 174, averaging 198. The 13-period average (P36-P48) is approximately 214 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 53 units with 903 units in transit. Since the game ends at Period 50 and any order placed now (P49) with a 4-period lead time will not arrive until Period 53 (beyond the game's horizon), the OR backend order logic effectively becomes moot for fulfillment purposes within the window. However, to maintain the correct policy based on the current regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=13) to capture the sustained peak of ~214 units/period, and sigma_hat also based on recent_N=13 to reflect the current volatility (approx 23). This ensures the base stock calculation accurately mirrors the most recent demand environment.

Carry-over insight: High-demand peak (P36-P48) stabilized: 13-period average demand is 214.1 units (Std Dev: ~23), slightly lower than the previously identified 12-period peak but significantly higher than the initial high-demand regime mean.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-demand peak starting around Period 36. Recent history (P36-P49) shows an average demand of approximately 211 units per period, which is higher than the initial high-demand regime (P16-P35) of ~199. Using the last 14 periods (P36-P49) provides a robust estimate for the current mean and volatility while excluding the irrelevant low-demand data from the first 15 periods. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 45 order in Period 49. Inventory levels are currently positive (on-hand 135) with a significant pipeline in-transit (814 units), as the system has adjusted to the higher demand. I will use recent_N with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current peak behavior accurately for the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand peak (P36-P49) stabilized: 14-period average demand is 210.9 units (Std Dev: ~24), confirming a shift upwards from the P16-P35 average of ~199.
