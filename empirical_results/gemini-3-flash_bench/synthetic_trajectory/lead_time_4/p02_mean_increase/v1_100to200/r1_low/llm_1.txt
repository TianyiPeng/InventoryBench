The average demand is approximately 102 units/period. c) Lead Time: The promised lead time is 4 periods.

I need to cover demand for periods 1-5 (L+1 approach). Total demand for 5 periods based on the average (102) is ~510 units. However, since the system satisfies demand from on-hand inventory *after* arrivals, and I start at 0, I will experience stockouts until the first delivery.

In-transit inventory consists of: P40 (200), P41 (225), P42 (265), and P43 (133), totaling 823 units. These will arrive in Periods 44, 45, 46, and 47 respectively. Total demand for the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50) is estimated at 1,435 units (205 * 7). Since order arrival takes 4 periods, any order placed now (P44) will arrive in Period 48. To cover Periods 48, 49, and 50, I need approximately 615 units. I currently have zero arriving in those periods. The existing in-transit (823) covers demand through roughly P47. Therefore, I will order 210 units to cover Period 48, while keeping an eye on the approaching end of the game to minimize ending inventory (holding costs).",

This covers the next ~3.8 periods. To cover exactly up to the end of Period 50, I need to order the difference: 1,025 - 784 = 241 units. Since there is a risk of slightly higher demand (some peaks reach 260-270) and I want to minimize lost sales in the final stretch without excessive holding costs, I will target the mean-based requirement. However, I must note that an order placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50 resolution phase, affecting only the final period's inventory and ending inventory. Any order placed after Period 46 will arrive after the game ends. Therefore, this is the final impactful order.",

Evaluating the last five periods (P42-P46), demand remains consistent with this regime (average 204.2). The actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. As of Period 47, we have 65 units on-hand and 731 units in-transit. The game ends at Period 50, meaning orders placed today (P47) will arrive in Period 51 (after the game concludes) and orders placed in Period 46 (already in-transit) will arrive in Period 50. Therefore, no further orders should be placed from Period 47 onwards to avoid unnecessary holding costs for inventory that arrives after the simulation ends. My current pipeline (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46) will cover the remaining demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50. Specifically: P47 will be met by P43's arrival (133 units), P48 by P44's (210 units), P49 by P45's (147 units), and P50 by P46's (241 units).",

Therefore, the priority is to utilize the current inventory and the incoming pipeline to satisfy the remaining demand (Periods 49 and 50) while minimizing holding costs. Current On-hand is 7 units. The In-transit pipeline of 388 units consists of orders from P45 (147 units), P46 (241 units), and subsequent zero orders. Based on the 4-period lead time: Order P45 (147) arrives in Period 49, and Order P46 (241) arrives in Period 50. Total expected supply for P49-P50 is: 7 (On-hand) + 147 (P45 arrival) + 241 (P46 arrival) = 395 units. The demand mean has been stable at ~201 units/period. Total expected demand for the final 2 periods is approximately 402 units. The current pipeline of 395 units effectively covers most of the expected demand for the remainder of the game without incurring unnecessary holding costs for units that would arrive after the game ends.

With Period 50 being the final period, the goal is to maximize the final period's reward while minimizing ending inventory (as there are no future periods to capture profit from and ending inventory incurs a holding cost). In Period 50, I have 0 on-hand inventory. The orders arriving during Period 50 include the shipment placed in Period 46 (241 units). Based on recent demand (mean ~217 over the last 4 periods), the 241 units arriving should be sufficient to cover Period 50's demand and likely leave a small surplus.
