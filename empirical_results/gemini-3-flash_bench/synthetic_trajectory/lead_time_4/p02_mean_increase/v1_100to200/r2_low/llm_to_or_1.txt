Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Currently, there is 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. The historical demand for the first 5 periods (Period_1 to Period_5) is provided: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89. The mean demand across these 5 samples is 101.8, and the standard deviation is approximately 28.5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. The goal for this first decision is to set a base stock level that covers demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have no specific calendar date or seasonality clues yet, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to generate a stable initial forecast. mu_hat needs to represent demand over (1+L) periods. 101.8 * 5 = 509. sigma_hat needs to represent volatility over the same period: sqrt(5) * 28.5 \u2248 63.7.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (149 units) is in-transit. With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this arrival is expected in Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 1 (demand was 126). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5 including pre-game) are 141, 118, 67, 94, 89, and current game Period 1 demand was 126. The average demand across these 6 points is approx 105.8. Since L=4, the coverage needed is (1+L)=5 periods. Our parameters aim to set a base stock that covers ~529 units (5 periods * 105.8). I will use the default lead time for now as no arrivals have concluded to suggest a drift. mu_hat will use the default (1+L)*mean_all to capture the available history.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have no on-hand inventory and 300 units in transit (ordered in P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at the start of Period 3, the orders from P1 (expected P5 arrival) and P2 (expected P6 arrival) are not yet due. The demand samples for Period 1 (141, 126 reported) and Period 2 (118, 83 reported) and Period 3 (67) show significant variance but no clear regime shift yet. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4 periods) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (using the 5 provided historical samples plus recent game history) to capture the current demand mean of ~101.8 units. This sets base stock to cover (4+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand is being resolved from on-hand inventory. The total in-transit is 428 units (149 from P1, 151 from P2, 128 from P3). Historical demand for the first 5 samples (including the provided context) shows a mean of approximately 101.8 units. Since we are in the early phase and no orders have arrived yet (which is expected given L=4), I will stick to the default lead time. For demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) to reflect the slight downward trend in the most recent periods (126, 83, 70), balancing the initially high demand with the more recent lower values to avoid excessive holding costs once the pipeline starts arriving.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no inventory has arrived yet. This is consistent with a 4-period lead time. Total in-transit is 465 units (149+151+128+37). Demand for the first 5 periods (including current period estimate) has been 141, 118, 67, 94, 89 (Avg: 101.8). Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand over (L+1) periods. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all 5 available demand samples to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, we finally received our first order (149 units) in Period 5, confirming the actual lead time L=4 matches the promised lead time. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods is: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109. The average demand is 98.6. Currently, we have 40 units on-hand and 348 units in-transit (orders from periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0) under the base stock policy. To ensure we cover the risk of stockouts during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), and given the demand seems relatively stable with some variance, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current mean and standard deviation. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate as the observed lead time confirms the promise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Orders from P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with samples: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73 (mean \u2248 94.3). Note that the prompt's provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section lists slightly different values (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) compared to the 'GAME HISTORY' section; I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' concluding demand values as they represent the actual realized environment. Currently, we have 118 units on hand and 302 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Since L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~94, the pipeline target is roughly 470 units. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 118 + 302 = 420. The OR backend will order the difference to reach the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full history of realized demand while allowing the system to stabilize after the initial stockout phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-112.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 (all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time). Demand history (Periods 1-7) shows values: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67. The mean demand is approximately 90.4 units. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), the target service level q = 0.5, meaning we target the mean demand over the risk period (L+1). With L=4, the risk period is 5 periods. Using all available samples (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as there are no clear regime shifts yet. The current pipeline inventory (In-transit: 226) plus on-hand (179) total 405 units, which covers more than 4 periods of average demand (~360 units), so the OR backend will place a smaller replenishment order to maintain the base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analyzing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 arrived in P5, P6, P7, and P8 respectively). This confirms an actual L=4. Demand history shows mean = 101.8 and std dev = 31.7 over periods 1-8. There was a significant demand spike in Period 8 (157 units), which is much higher than the previous periods (avg ~94). However, with only one high data point, it is too early to declare a regime shift. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the more recent demand variability (Periods 4-8: 105, 109, 73, 67, 157. Mean=102.2). The current inventory (On-hand: 59, In-transit: 237) totals 296 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. My parameters will target a base stock sufficient to cover this window while accounting for the recent spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history: Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by orders from Periods 1-5 arriving in Periods 5-9). Current on-hand is 0, and we have 367 units in-transit (orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, 9). Historical demand (Periods 1-9) shows a mean of approximately 99.8 units (126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67, 157, 107). Period 8 and 9 showed higher demand (157, 107), but it fluctuates. Since Profit ($1) is equal to Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand to minimize total costs. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use the last 5 samples to capture the more recent demand variation while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently 4 periods (confirmed across 5 consecutive deliveries: P1-P5 orders). Demand mean remains stable around 100 but shows high variance (Range: 67-157).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical analysis shows the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (confirmed for orders P1 through P6). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has a mean of approximately 98.7 units per period across 10 periods (987 total), but it is volatile, ranging from 67 to 157. Period 9 saw a stockout where demand (107) exceeded on-hand inventory (91), but arrivals in Period 10 helped recover. Currently, we have 15 units on-hand and 408 units in transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent history of this stable but high-variance regime. The OR backend will use the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which is low, meaning it will prioritize avoiding excess inventory at the expense of potential stockouts, given high holding costs relative to profit.

We are at Period 12. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5 through P11). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in P11 (demand was 94, only 67 available). The order from Period 8 (48 units) is expected to arrive during Period 12. Total in-transit is 427 units (Orders from P8-P11). Demand mean over the last 11 periods is approximately 101.9, with a standard deviation of 27.8. The current period (P12) order must cover demand through P17 (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we have had two consecutive periods (P9, P11) with lost sales due to stockouts, I will use recent history (N=11) to stabilize the forecast, ensuring a slightly more robust safety stock to handle the observed variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Analysis of the historical data shows that demand has been fairly stable but volatile, with a mean around 99.5 units and a standard deviation around 28 units. Crucially, we have experienced stockouts in Periods 9, 11, and 12 because historical orders (placed during a dip in Period 4 and 5) were too small to meet current demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P8). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 444 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the full history for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides the most stable estimate given the high variance and no clear regime shift. Setting L to default (4) as it aligns with observed performance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which aligns with the promised lead time (L=4). Orders from Periods 1 to 9 have all arrived exactly on schedule. Regarding demand, the mean for the first 13 periods is approximately 95 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P9-P13) show a slightly lower average of 85.8 units with significant variance (ranging from 44 to 107). To balance against historical high-demand spikes (like 157 in Period 8) while respecting the current trend, I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand estimation to capture the broader volatility while being responsive to the stable mean. With a profit of $1 and a holding cost of $1, the service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock target will be the median of the distribution over (L+1) periods (5 periods). The current in-transit inventory (331) and on-hand (118) total 449 units, which covers about 4.7 periods of average demand (approx 95 units/period), suggesting we are well-positioned but need to maintain replenishment to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 9, 11, and 12.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 10 completed delivery cycles (P1-P10). Average demand remains stable at approximately 101 units per period (combined history and game samples), but the variance is significant, with demand ranging from 44 to 157. Currently, on-hand inventory is 119 and in-transit inventory is 201 (orders from Periods 11-14). Given the profit and holding cost are equal (target service level ~50% before the cap), the priority is avoiding excessive holding costs while maintaining enough stock to cover the expected (L+1) period demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the most relevant demand stability while ensuring L is explicitly 4.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, we have a clear history of 11 completed order cycles, all confirming a consistent lead time (L) of 4. The promised lead time of 4 is accurate. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 94, 84, 44, 145, 155) averages 104.4, with a notable increase in volatility compared to the earlier periods. Specifically, Periods 14 and 15 showed significant demand spikes (145 and 155). The mean for the last 10 periods is approximately 98.9 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increased variance while maintaining a stable mean estimate. With L=4, the backend will calculate a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the service level q is 0.5, meaning base_stock = mu_hat. This approach balances the stock-outs seen in Periods 9, 11, and 12 with the higher holding costs that come from these larger shipments, while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following a stockout in Period 16 (demand 185 vs 100 available). The demand has shown a significant upward trend in recent periods (P14: 145, P15: 155, P16: 185), while the historical mean was approximately 100. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. The pipeline (In-transit: 385) includes orders from P13 (49), P14 (16), P15 (154), and P16 (166). The order from P13 (49 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P17), but it is unlikely to satisfy the new demand level. Given this regime shift in demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent surge and increased volatility. This will increase the base stock level to cover the anticipated higher demand over the lead time and review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 14: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~160 (+60%) over the last 3 periods (P14-P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing a 'chips(Regular)' SKU with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4. The current status shows 0 units on-hand and 553 units in-transit, with historical stockouts occurring in recent periods due to a significant demand regime shift. Starting Period 14, demand jumped from a mean of ~100 to an average of 161.75 over the last four periods (P14: 145, P15: 155, P16: 185, P17: 162). To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. This aims to increase the base stock level to cover the (L+1) period pipeline at the new demand level. The OR backend's inventory policy, targeting a service level (q) of 0.5 (since Profit/Profit+Holding = 1/2), will use these updated estimates to better protect against stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has definitively shifted since Period 14. Average demand from Periods 1-13 was ~95, whereas Periods 14-18 have seen an average demand of ~170, with the most recent sample (P18) reaching 205. The current inventory position is critical: on-hand is 0, and current shipments are lagging behind this spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the recent 5-period average of ~170 units, mu_hat (total inventory across the lead time + review period) should be set to approximately 850 (5 * 170). Using 'recent_N' with N=5 will allow the OR backend to recalculate based on this new higher-demand regime while capturing the increased volatility (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: Period 14-18 average demand is 170.4 (+80% from baseline), with P18 peaking at 205.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20. Analysis of the demand history reveals a significant structural shift: Period 14-19 demand levels are (145, 155, 185, 162, 205, 203), averaging 175.83 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. The last three periods (P17-P19) specifically average 190. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy with a cap, and our profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1 (suggesting a 50% service level target), we must set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime to avoid severe stockouts. I will use N=6 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand regime from P14-P19) and N=6 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility in this new regime. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the new elevated average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 14-19 average demand is 176 (+76% from baseline), with the last three periods (P17-P19) consistently exceeding 160 and reaching 200+.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly from a baseline of ~100 to an average of ~178 over the last 7 periods (P14-P20), with recent periods consistently near or above 200. Despite a high fill rate from in-transit stock, on-hand inventory remains at 0 due to the demand surge. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. To prevent chronic stockouts, I am adjusting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this new regime (mean ~178, so mu_hat for L=4 should be roughly (1+4)*178 = 890). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) handles the increased volatility observed in this higher-demand state. This strategy ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher throughput requirement.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are dealing with a severe stockout situation despite a consistent lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime has shifted dramatically upwards since Period 14. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been: 162, 205, 203, 194, 244, resulting in a mean of 201.6. This is double the initial baseline of ~100. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 676 in-transit (P18-P21 orders). Since L=4, we are ordering for a 5-period window (L+1). My forecast (mu_hat) is set to (1+4) * 201.6 = 1008 to ensure we cover this new high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 8 periods (covering the shift) to capture the increased volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 36, sqrt(5)*36 \u2248 80). The OR backend's service level (q) is 0.5 because profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), but given the recurring stockouts and Lost Sales, a robust mu_hat based on the last 5 samples is necessary to catch up.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Periods 17-21 average demand reached 201.6, a 100% increase from the initial baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was around 100, but starting around Period 14, it escalated. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P14-P22) is approximately 186 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) averaging 205.8 units. Period 21 saw a peak of 244 units. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this higher demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which sets a base stock level that accounts for the current 4-period lead time. Recent observations consistently confirm the lead time remains at 4 periods. Setting parameters using the recent higher-demand window is necessary to prevent stockouts, as ending inventory has been zero or near-zero for several periods despite large arrivals.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by a stable lead time of 4 periods and a confirmed significant demand regime shift that began around Period 14. Initial baseline demand was ~100 per period, but recent data (Periods 18-23) shows a stable average of approximately 201 units per period (132+184 sold+lost at P23, but actual demand was 184). Specifically, the last 6 periods of demand were: 205, 203, 194, 244, 183, 184 (Mean = 202). I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of this new elevated demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this higher volume and the associated volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' is safe given the consistent 4-period lead time observed throughout history. Current on-hand is 0, so the backend OR logic will utilize the in-transit pipeline (800 units) to determine the necessary replenishment to meet the base stock target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began around Period 14 has stabilized at a higher level. Over the last 10 periods (P15-P24), the average demand is approximately 188.5 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. The most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) show a mean demand of 195 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of orders from P1-P20. On-hand inventory is critically low (12 units) with significant stockouts occurring in recent periods (P16-P21, P23). The current pipeline (829 units) is being processed, and larger orders placed since P21 (179, 255, 184, 211) are expected to arrive sequentially. To maintain a high service level for the current high-demand regime while accounting for the stabilized higher variance, I will use a recent_N window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift without being overly reactive to single-period fluctuations (like the 244 in P21 or 170 in P24).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at approximately 190 units (Periods 15-24 average: 188.5; Periods 20-24 average: 195).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14, moving from a baseline of ~100 to a new level around 190. Recent demand samples (P20-P25) are 194, 244, 183, 184, 170, and 221, averaging 199.3. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 752 units in transit. Using N=10 for sigma_hat will provide a robust volatility estimate over the high-demand regime. Despite high in-transit quantities, the stockouts in recent periods (P23, P25) demonstrate that the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to satisfy this increased demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~200 units (Periods 20-25 average: 199.3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 14 and has stabilized in a range of approximately 180-220 units. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P17-P26) is approximately 201 units, while the more recent 5-period average (P22-P26) is 181 units. Lead time is reliably confirmed as 4 periods based on the most recent 18 deliveries (P5 to P26). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock calculation targets the median demand. Currently, the pipeline inventory is high (737 units) due to aggressive ordering during the recent stockout phase. Choosing N=7 for recent_N captures the high-demand regime while moderately smoothing the recent volatility (147 to 244).

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average demand is approximately 196.8 units per period, while the last 5 periods (P23-P27) average 189.8 units. The most recent demand (P27) was 227 units, suggesting continued high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z*=0). I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the higher mean and variance for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=10 balances the need to reflect the newer regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime following a significant shift around Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P19-P28), the mean demand is approximately 196.3 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~100. The most recent 5 periods (P24-P28) show an average of 189.8 units with a standard deviation of 30.6. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving on schedule from P20-P24. No items appear to be lost or excessively delayed. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the backend's base-stock logic will target. I am using recent_N=9 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since P20, providing a robust mean and volatility estimate for the current 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime after a shift that began around Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the average demand is 199.9 units, and the last 5 periods (P25-P29) show an average of 207.6 units. The most recent demand (P29) was 239 units, indicating persistent high volume. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 29 ended with zero on-hand inventory and the last arrival was only 102 units (meeting only part of the demand), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this stable high-demand regime while filtering out the earlier lower-demand baseline. This will ensure the base stock levels are calculated to cover the expected ~200 units/period demand across the review and 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~200 units (Periods 20-29 average: 199.9).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 20, with a mean demand of approximately 200 units per period. The most recent 10 periods (P21-P30) show an average demand of 203.5 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, which targets the median of the demand distribution. I am using recent_N=11 (Periods 20-30) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. This ensures the base stock (forecasted demand over the 5-period risk horizon of L+1) accurately reflects current customer behavior without being skewed by the initial baseline of ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level of approximately 200 units per period starting around Period 20. The most recent 12 periods (P20-P31) show an average demand of 199.33. Although there is high variance, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced several periods of stockouts or near-stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals. To ensure sufficient stock to cover the review period plus lead time (1+4=5 periods), I am setting L to the promised 4 and using the last 12 periods (the duration of the current stable high-demand regime) for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a service level dictated by the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio, while adapting to the significantly increased demand volume observed since the regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial periods. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P20 to P32), the mean demand is approximately 197 units per period, consistently significantly higher than the initial ~100 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by uninterrupted arrivals from P1 through P28 orders. Currently, we have 84 units on-hand and 764 units in-transit (orders from P29, P30, P31, and P32). Since the promised lead time of 4 is reliable and the demand has reached a stable new regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 to capture this sustained shift while ignoring the early lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) at the higher demand rate.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime of approximately 200 units per period since Period 20. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is 192.1 units, and for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) it is 203.0 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 77, and there is a significant pipeline of 728 units scheduled to arrive. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (from Period 20 onwards) will accurately capture this stabilized high-demand regime and its associated volatility. This period's focus is maintaining the base stock level to cover the lead time + review period (5 periods) while accounting for the established demand level of ~200 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 20, with an average of approximately 200 units per period. Recent performance (Periods 30-34) shows an average demand of 200.2 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of shipments from Periods 26 through 30 exactly 4 periods after ordering. The inventory strategy aims to satisfy this sustained high demand while accounting for the lead time delay. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for mu_hat to capture this stable high-demand regime while filtering out the initial low-demand phase. For sigma_hat, N=15 will also be used to reflect the variance within this current regime. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 200 units since approximately Period 20. Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), the average demand is 201.5 units, confirming this stability. There are no recent calendar-based or seasonal shifts detected. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by latest arrivals (P31 order arrived in P35). On-hand inventory is 77, and in-transit inventory is 706, which includes orders from P32, P33, P34, and P35. To maintain the service level at this stable demand level, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean (approx 200) and volatility, while setting L to default (4 periods). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand (~1000 units), accounting for the high pipeline relative to on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 200 units per period since Period 20. Recent demand (Periods 32-36) shows a mean of 207.4, confirming this regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are in a high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (N=17, covering Period 20 to 36) to capture the stabilized mean of ~200 while accounting for the observed variance. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand at approximately 1000 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand spiked significantly to 369, which is nearly double the previous stable average of ~200. This could indicate a new demand regime or a seasonal peak (e.g., a holiday or event). The 'In-transit' inventory is very high (872 units), representing orders from Periods 34, 35, 36, and 37. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp increase in demand, I will adjust mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 33-37) to capture the recent upward trend while acknowledging the volatility. This balances the need to respond to the spike without over-correcting if Period 37 was an outlier. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increased variance observed in recent periods. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift or spike detected at Period 37: demand increased to 369 (+85% vs previous Mean of 200).

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, a major demand spike occurred (369 units), significantly higher than the previous stabilized mean of ~200. Period 38 saw a return to 214, which is closer to the previous mean but still on the higher side. The inventory is currently 0, and we have 1053 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the sharp spike in P37, I will increase the demand forecast to account for higher volatility and a potentially higher average during this period. I am choosing N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility spike while acknowledging the long lead time (L=4). Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected Period 37 (369 units); Period 38 demand (214 units) suggests a return to the ~200 regime but indicates increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase. After a significant spike to 369 units in Period 37, demand has remained elevated compared to the previous ~200 baseline (214 in P38, 271 in P39). The mean demand over the last three periods is approximately 285 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and current demand trending higher, I am adjusting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this recent surge and increased volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-demand regime observed in the most recent periods, helping to mitigate stockouts while balancing the high holding cost which equals the profit margin (critical for avoiding overstock).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike confirmed: Period 37-39 average demand is 284.7 units, an increase of ~42% over the previous 200-unit stability phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new phase of high volatility and increased mean starting at Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to 40 is 256.5 units, compared to the previous stable mean of ~200. This shift is likely seasonal or event-driven given the sharp peak of 369 in Period 37 followed by fluctuations (214, 271, 172). To ensure high service levels during this volatile period, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent higher demand level of approximately 256.5 per period. Over (1+L) = 5 periods, this leads to a mu_hat of ~1282. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the significantly increased standard deviation observed in the last segment (P31-P40 std is approx 57.5, vs earlier periods being lower). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical conclusions, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 37: Mean increased to ~256 units with significantly higher volatility (P37-P40 range: 172-369).

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 37. Analyzing demand from Period 37 to 41, the samples are [369, 214, 271, 172, 164]. While the mean in this segment is 238, the last two periods (172, 164) show a sharp decline, potentially indicating that the spike was temporary or followed by a cooling period. However, given the profit/holding cost ratio (1:1), we aim for a 50% service level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' reflects this consistency. For mu_hat, I am choosing 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the regime since P37) to capture the elevated but now cooling demand level (avg ~238). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility observed during this recent shift (range 164-369). The in-transit inventory is very high (1001), which is significantly above the expected demand for the lead time (avg 238 * 5 = 1190, against current pipeline + on-hand), meaning the OR backend will likely scale back ordering significantly to avoid overstocking while demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly starting P37; while the mean for P37-P41 is ~238, the most recent two periods (P40-P41) have dropped below 175, suggesting the regime shift may be mean-reverting or highly inconsistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-133.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile phase since Period 37. After a significant spike to 369 units, the last three periods (P40-P42) have seen a downward trend with demand values of 172, 164, and 175 respectively. This suggests that the previously suspected regime shift to ~250+ was temporary or that the system is experiencing high-amplitude swings. The current on-hand inventory (308) plus in-transit units (707) provides a substantial pipeline. Given that the recent 6-period mean (P37-P42) is 227.5 but the most recent 3-period mean is only 170, a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat is appropriate to avoid over-ordering during a downward swing while maintaining enough safety stock for the high volatility (sigma). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-P37; recent 3-period demand (P40-P42) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~170 compared to the P37-P39 mean of ~285.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-192.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited significant volatility recently. Following a major spike in Period 37 (369 units), the demand has consistently moderated over the last four periods (P40-P43), averaging 169.5 units. This suggests the high-demand regime either peaked or was a transient series of spikes, and we are now in a lower-demand, high-on-hand state. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (359) and pipeline inventory is substantial (612), totaling 971 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With the recent mean around 170-180, our total stock (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds the projected requirement of ~900 units. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the descent from the spike and the stabilization at the lower ~170 level. I am keeping L at 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to account for the high volatility observed during this transition phase. This configuration will likely result in the OR backend ordering very little or nothing, which is appropriate given the current inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean following Period 37 spike: Period 40-43 average demand is 169.5 units, down from the P37-P39 average of 284.7.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has returned to a more stable regime after the extreme volatility observed between Periods 37-39. In the last five periods (P40-P44), demand has averaged 183.8 units (172, 164, 175, 167, 241), which is closer to the pre-spike 200-unit baseline. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 505 units due to the arrival of large orders placed during the high-volatility phase (P38, P40). With 225 units in-transit (P41-P44 orders), the pipeline is sufficient for the immediate lead time. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 5 to prioritize the current post-spike stability and prevent over-ordering while on-hand inventory is high.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized at 183.8 units over Periods 40-44 following the Period 37-39 volatility spike.

Over the last six periods (P40-P45), demand has averaged 185.5 units (172, 164, 175, 167, 241, 194), which is significantly lower than the ~256 units projected during the spike but consistent with the long-term baseline established after Period 14. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. With 342 units on hand and 383 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders in P42, P43, P44, and P45), the pipeline is well-stocked relative to the current 185-unit mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this stabilized demand mean and variance, which allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock downward from the spike levels, preventing excessive holding costs in the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-P37 spike: Period 40-45 average demand is 185.5 units, returning to the ~190-200 unit range seen before the volatility event.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~185 units following a significant volatility spike between Periods 37-39. Since that spike, demand from Period 40 to 46 has averaged 185.3 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this post-spike stability (Periods 40-46). Sigma_hat is also set using N=7 to reflect the current moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (264) and pipeline inventory (515) is high due to large orders placed during the Period 38-40 spike era arriving now, so the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the significant volatility and spike around Period 37. Over the last eight periods (P40-P47), the average demand is 184.5 units, which aligns closely with the pre-spike regime of ~190-200 units. The inventory position is currently healthy with 173 units on-hand and 515 units in-transit (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). The order from P44 (0 units) will 'arrive' in Period 48, providing no stock, while the order from P45 (189 units) will arrive in Period 49. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50), I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the stabilized mean of 184.5. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=8) to reflect the recent demand variability while avoiding the extreme outlier of Period 37. This approach ensures sufficient inventory for the final periods without excessive holding costs.

Daily Profit: $173.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at zero on-hand inventory with 750 units in-transit. Looking at the history, the order from Period 44 (0 units) would have arrived in Period 48, which explains the 'arrived=0' message in the P48 conclude. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The demand regime has stabilized following the P37 spike. Over the last 9 periods (P40-P48), the average demand is 187 units. While the most recent three periods (P46-P48) averaged 190.3, the overall trend since the post-spike stabilization (P40-P48) suggests a mean of ~190. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this stabilized post-volatility mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need for recent accuracy while smoothing out the volatility observed since Period 37.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-P37 spike at ~190 units (Average P40-P48: 187.1). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a regime of approximately 190-200 units following a period of extreme volatility (P37-P39). The most recent demand samples (P47-P49: 214, 208, 200) confirm this stability with an average of 207.3. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Note: Period 44 order was 0, which explains the 'arrived=0' in Period 48 conclude message (since P44 + 4 = P48). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a total of 747 units in-transit. To maintain the service level across the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 1+L=5 periods), the base stock should be calculated using the recent stable regime. I will use recent_N=10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable behavior since P40, which yields a mean of 196.6 units per period. I'll also use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the current moderated volatility compared to the P37 spike.
