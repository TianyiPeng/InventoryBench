According to the timing mechanism, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (after this decision).

Average demand is ~102 units/period. \nPipeline Assessment: The current pipeline (493) plus the OR recommendation (4) equals 497 units. This covers approximately 4.8 periods of demand (497 / 102). Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. \nOR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 4 units. This is very low because the OR agent observes a high pipeline (493) relative to the expected demand and the lead time of 4.

The average demand for Periods 15-18 is 176.75 units, significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. The OR baseline recommendation of 0 is likely due to the high pipeline inventory (601 units) relative to historical (older) demand averages.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Visible in-transit: 120 (P15), 153 (P16), 164 (P17), 164 (P18). Total = 601. \n4. Strategy: Period 19's arrival (ordered P15) is 120 units. Expected demand is ~177 units. This creates a projected stockout for the current period and keeps on-hand inventory at zero for the foreseeable future if demand remains at the new level. The total pipeline of 601 units covers roughly 3.4 periods of demand at the new rate (601 / 177).

The '0' arrival in P36 is expected, as no order was placed in P32. 2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) consists of orders from P33 (0), P34 (180), P35 (180), and P36 (300), totaling 660 units. These are scheduled to arrive in P37, P38, P39, and P40 respectively. However, the order from P33 was 0, meaning an arrival of 0 units this period (P37). 3. Demand Analysis: The demand regime shift noted in Period 15 remains stable, with demand averaging ~205 units over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). 4. Requirement Calculation: To cover the lead time (4 periods) plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), we need roughly 5 * 205 = 1025 units. Total inventory currently accounted for is 0 (on-hand) + 660 (in-transit) = 660. 5. Action: The OR recommendation is 100 units, but based on a target of ~1025 units, the deficit is 365 units. However, I must be mindful of the holding cost ($1) and the OR cap logic which prevents over-ordering.

History confirms this (e.g., P30 order arrived at start of P34). However, the orders from P32 and P33 (both 0 units) resulted in no arrivals in P36 and P37 as expected. Currently, shipments from P34 (180), P35 (180), P36 (300), and P37 (300) are in transit. Demand Analysis: Demand has undergone multiple shifts. Period 15 saw an increase to ~200. Most recently (P37), demand spiked to 369. While P37 might be an outlier, the sustained average since P15 is clearly higher than the early history. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 0 units because the pipeline (960) exceeds its calculated base-stock level. However, the OR agent uses all history (back to P1), which dilutes the current high-demand regime. Strategy: With 960 units in the pipeline and 0 on hand, and a 4-period lead time, we have roughly 240 units/period arriving over the next 4 periods. If demand stays at the ~200-240 level, this is adequate. If demand stays at the P37 level (369), we will stock out again.

There is a critical gap in P40 because no order was placed in P32/P33 (actually, looking at arrivals, P31 arrived P35, but P32 and P33 were 0 orders). This means during P40, arrivals will be 0.

Strategy: With a total pool of 846 units and an expected demand of ~184 units per period, the current stock covers roughly 4.6 periods. Since we are at Period 45 and the game ends at Period 50, we only need to cover 6 more periods of demand. Projected total demand for the remainder is ~1,104 units (184 * 6). Our current inventory (846) is slightly short. However, a large order now would arrive in P49 (lead time 4), meaning it would only be useful for P49 and P50. \n5.

Current On-hand inventory is 503 units, and In-transit inventory consists of 300 units (150 from P45, 150 from P46). Looking at recent demand history (P40-P46), the average demand is approximately 183 units per period. The 503 units on hand already cover roughly 2.7 periods of demand. The 150 units ordered in Period 45 will arrive at the start of Period 50 (the final period), bringing available stock to 653 units for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50). Expected total demand for these 4 periods is approximately 732 units (183 * 4). However, holding costs are high ($1.0), and we are at the end of the game where leftover inventory significantly penalizes the total reward. The OR recommendation is extremely low (16 units) because it recognizes the high on-hand balance relative to the remaining horizon and the risk of holding costs. Given we are at Period 47, any order placed now (lead time 4) will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the game's 50-period window.

Since we already have 589 units (289 on-hand + 300 in-transit) and the lead time is 4, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game end.
