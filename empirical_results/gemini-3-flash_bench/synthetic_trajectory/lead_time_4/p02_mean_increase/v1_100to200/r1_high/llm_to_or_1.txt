Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical 'conclude' messages to infer the actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 4. Historical demand samples for the first 5 periods (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) show a mean of 101.8 and a standard deviation of 28.5. Since we are at the very beginning of the game and have no pipeline or on-hand inventory, I need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'default' methods to utilize all available historical samples to set the initial parameters, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead-time deviation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, 149 units were ordered, but because the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly in-transit and not yet arrived. The inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales (demand was 91, sold 0). The demand history for the last 5 periods (including Period 1 data from the history and the conclude message) is: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89, and the most recent demand was 91. The average demand across these 6 samples is roughly 100. Since we have very little data and no evidence of lead time deviation yet, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the local mean and volatility. I'll set N=5 to focus on the most recent behavior while maintaining some stability.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1:141, P2:118, P3:67, P4:94, P5:89. However, the game observations show demand of 91 and 130 for P1 and P2 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 271 units in-transit (149 from P1 and 122 from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, nothing could have arrived yet if the lead time is indeed 4 (P1 order would arrive in P5). My goal is to set parameters that cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Based on the historical demand provided (mean ~102) and recent observations (mean ~110), I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available samples to project the base stock. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies maintaining a healthy safety stock via the OR backend's service level calculation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (149 units), Period 2 (122 units), and Period 3 (148 units), totaling 419 units in-transit. None of these have arrived yet, which is consistent with a 4-period lead time (the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales as demand (Avg ~111 in the first three periods) cannot be met. Historical demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) show significant variance. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent patterns while accounting for the high initial variance, and keep L at the promised 'default' of 4 until arrival data suggests otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 5 periods is: 141 (P1), 118 (P2), 67 (P3), 94 (P4), and 89 (P5). The average demand is approximately 101.8 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, meaning they will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. This is expected given the 4-period lead time. To ensure we have enough stock to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), the base stock should target the expected demand over those 5 periods. Using all 5 available samples provides a stable initial forecast (mean ~102).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1971.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, an order placed in Period 1 arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4, which matches the promised lead time. This confirms the timing mechanism (Order P1 -> Arrive P5). Demand has been relatively stable: Period 1\u20135 demands were 91, 130, 114, 118, 106. The mean demand is approximately 111.8 units per period. The standard deviation across these 5 samples is approximately 14.5. Currently, we have 43 units on hand and 471 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). The pipeline is quite full. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4, I will use L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent and relevant demand distribution which covers all available full-period data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Current demand regime mean is ~112 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $755.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. From game history, we have confirmed the lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods, as both Period 1 and Period 2 orders arrived in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. The promised lead time is also 4. Current inventory status: 119 on-hand and 448 in-transit. The demand history shows a mean of 100.8 units over the first 6 periods (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46). Notably, Period 6 saw a drop to 46 units, but it is too early to call this a sustained regime shift. The carry-over insight suggests a mean of ~112, but recalculating based on all 6 conclude messages gives 100.8. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as it aligns with observed history, and 'recent_N' for demand (N=6) to capture the overall average while including the most recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1453.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7 all showing 4-period durations). Demand across the last 7 periods averages approximately 98.7 units (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86). However, the inclusion of P6 (46) and P7 (86) suggests a potential downward variance or softening from the initial higher levels (114-130). We have 181 on-hand and 347 in-transit. The in-transit includes orders from P4 (133), P5 (68), P6 (99), and P7 (47). The total pipeline plus on-hand (528) is significant. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using recent demand history (N=7) provides a balanced mean estimate of ~99, so mu_hat should be around 495. Since current inventory (528) exceeds this, the OR backend will likely minimize new orders, which is appropriate given the high on-hand and pipeline stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand parameters to reflect the full observed history while honoring the confirmed L=4.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods 5 through 8 confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Total demand samples (N=8) show a mean of ~99.25 units/period. Recent history (Periods 5-8) shows a mean of 85.25. However, the initial samples (Periods 1-4) were higher (~113). Since this is a snack product (chips), demand typically fluctuates but remains relatively stable around a mean of 100. On-hand inventory is currently high (211) due to the pipeline catching up. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=8) to capture the overall average, and the default calculation for lead time as it is stable. The OR backend will use the provided service level (q = 19/20 = 95%) to set the base stock level.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Demand over the last 9 periods has been relatively stable with no clear regime shift beyond random variation around the mean (Avg ~99). Current On-hand + In-transit (181 + 313 = 494) is being managed by the OR backend. Forecast for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at a mean of ~99 would be 495. I will continue to use the recent history (all 9 concluded periods) to estimate mu and sigma to ensure the base stock is responsive to the realized demand volatility (std dev ~25). Setting L to default (4) as it is stable.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 6. The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 10 periods has fluctuated but remains relatively stable around a mean of ~103 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a mean demand of approximately 94 units, while the earlier periods (P1-P5) were around 112 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 305 units and On-hand is 143 units, totaling 448 units. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a service level consistent with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95). I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the overall average demand while accounting for recent variability, and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period duration is stable.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 12, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all 7 received shipments (orders from Period 1 through 7 all arrived exactly 4 periods later). Current demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 11 periods has a mean of 101.36 and a standard deviation of 25.4. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a mean of 102.0. There is no significant evidence of a regime shift or seasonal spike yet; demand remains relatively stable around 100-110 units. The pipeline (404 units) plus on-hand (104 units) totals 508. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using a recent window (N=11) for mu and sigma provides a balanced forecast. The base stock will target approximately (1+4)*101.36 + z*sigma, ensuring high service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Periods 1 through 8. Currently, the system is in a stable demand regime. Analyzing demand from Period 1 to Period 12, the mean is approximately 100.25 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 25.04. The recent Carry-over Insight suggested a mean of 112, but calculating the average across all 12 concluded periods shows a slightly lower average. However, since the goal is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, I will use recent_N=12 to capture the full observed history while maintaining the L=4 assumption. The pipeline inventory (427) plus on-hand (85) total 512, which is roughly 5.1 periods of average demand, suggesting we are well-positioned, but need to maintain the base stock level to account for volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2176.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe a consistent actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable. Calculating the mean demand from the last 13 periods (Periods 1-13) gives approximately 101.5 units per period. The recent 5 periods (Periods 9-13) show an average demand of 105.2, indicating a slight upward trend or stable variance. To ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) window (4+1=5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the full recent history while acknowledging the stability. The profit/holding cost ratio is high ($19/$1), supporting a high service level (~95%). Current on-hand (66) and in-transit (406) total 472 units. With an expected demand of ~102/period, the pipeline covers roughly 4.6 periods, which is close to our L+1 requirement. Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation ensures the OR backend adapts to the observed volatility in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2063.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Period 15. Analysis of the game history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (consistently observed across all arrived orders from Period 1 through Period 10). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable. Recent demand samples (Periods 10-14: 137, 86, 87, 118, 111) show a mean of 107.8 units, which is consistent with the previously identified regime of ~112 units. In-transit inventory (438 units) includes orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14. Specifically, the order from Period 11 (146 units) is expected to arrive during Period 15 (visible at the start of Period 16), bringing the on-hand inventory up to roughly 46 - 108 + 146 = 84 units for the next decision cycle. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), it is optimal to maintain a high service level. Since no structural shifts in demand or lead time are detected, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable demand distribution while filtering out the initial noise. Lead time (L) remains at the promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1348.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 16. Analyzing demand from Period 6 onwards (when stockouts resolved), the mean demand for 'chips(Regular)' is approximately 100 units/period (98.9 units over the last 10 periods). The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all 11 delivered orders. We have 115 units on-hand and 387 units in-transit (orders from periods 12-15). Since the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual lead time, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat, the demand remains relatively stable without clear regime shifts or strong seasonality in the data provided, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the post-stockout mean demand accurately. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock (covering L+1 periods) is calibrated to the most reliable recent performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3914.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand surged unexpectedly to 273 units, compared to the previous average of ~112 units. This wiped out the entire on-hand inventory (starting inventory 206, demand 273, sold 206, leaving 0). This spike may be a one-time event or the start of a higher demand regime. Given the critical stockout, I must increase the demand forecast. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 to incorporate this new data point while still weighting it against recent history. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The order placed in Period 13 (78 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 17) providing some relief, though potentially not enough if demand remains at 273. I'm choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the increased volatility and mean.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 16 (273 units compared to ~100 average), resulting in total stockout and potential regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1482.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a state of stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Period 16 and 17 showed a massive demand spike (273 and 170 respectively), significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. This suggests a potential holiday or seasonal regime shift. The 'In-transit' pipeline is 496 units, with Period 14's order (123 units) expected to arrive in Period 18. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we need to set our parameters to cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of this high-demand regime. The mean demand for the last 2 periods is 221.5. I will set mu_hat to explicitly cover this new level (5 * 220 = 1100). Sigma_hat is increased to 150 to account for the significantly higher volatility observed during this spike. L remains 'default' (4) as lead times are stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 avg increased to ~220 units (+100% vs historical average of 112).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last three periods (P16: 273, P17: 170, P18: 232) averages approximately 225 units per period, which is a significant increase from the historical average of ~112. We are currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite daily arrivals because the orders placed 4 periods ago were based on the old, lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this new regime (Period 16-18). sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand state. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock level (covering L+1 periods) to recover from the stockout and maintain the necessary service level for this SKU's high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1805.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. The demand from P16-P18 averaged ~225 units, though P19 dropped to 116. Given the stockouts (on-hand is 0), we must ensure we cover the lead time (4) plus the current period (total 5 periods). Historical lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline is currently 920 units, largely due to large orders placed in P17-P19 to compensate for the surge. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (covering P16-P19) which results in an average demand of ~198 units per period. This gives a total requirement (L+1) of 990 units. Setting L to 4 using the calculate method. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (4) to capture the increased volatility during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly starting Period 16; mean demand for P16-P19 is 197.75, compared to pre-P16 mean of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly since Period 16. The pre-Period 16 mean was approximately 100 units/period, but the mean of the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 191 units/period (273, 170, 232, 116, 164). We are currently experiencing a stockout situation (on-hand is 0) despite consistent arrivals, because the lag between ordering and receiving (Lead Time = 4) means we are only now receiving orders placed during the lower-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P20 conclusion (P16 order arrived in P20). I will use N=5 for the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this new, higher-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the earlier periods. This will increase the base stock calculation to align with the new demand average of ~191 units/period, ensuring future orders are sized appropriately to meet the higher demand and clear the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 16-20 average demand is 191.0 units/period, representing a sustained ~90% increase over the baseline of ~100.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand for the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21: 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180), the average is 189.17 units/period, compared to the pre-P16 average of approximately 100. This confirms a sustained ~90% increase in mean demand. The volatility has also increased, with a standard deviation of approximately 50.8 units in this new regime. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (P17 order arrived in P21). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (33) following several periods of stockouts, but there is a large in-transit pipeline (969 units) resulting from aggressive ordering in periods 18-20 to catch up to the new demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (P16-P21). I will set L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent periods (P16-P22), the demand has averaged approximately 189 units per period (samples: 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189), which is nearly double the pre-shift average of ~100. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. My objective is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of this new high-demand regime. The carry-over insights confirm this shift. We currently have 175 units on hand and a large pipeline (786 units) following the aggressive orders placed in Periods 18-20 to catch up with the surge. By setting the calculation window for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to N=7, I capture the entirety of the high-demand regime while excluding the irrelevant lower historical data. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock level appropriate for the current ~190 units/period demand pattern.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P16-P23) is approximately 181.37 units per period, compared to the baseline of ~100. Recent periods (P21, P22, P23) show stabilized demand at 180, 189, and 187 respectively. I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime while capturing the volatility introduced by the spike in Period 16. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory has finally recovered (299 units) due to the large orders placed during the stockout phase arriving. I will maintain the base stock level using the recent demand statistics to ensure service levels are met without excessive overstocking now that 'In-transit' is quite high (646 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 16 shift: P21-P23 average is ~185 units/period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted and stabilized since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean is approximately 183.1 units per period (excluding Period 16's extreme spike of 273), or 193.1 units if included. Recent stability over the last 4 periods (P21-P24) shows an average of ~190 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering Period 16 to 24) to capture this higher demand regime fully. Lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 408 and in-transit at 506, we are currently well-stocked, but must maintain the base stock level to satisfy the sustained ~190 unit/period demand across the L+1 (5 period) risk window. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to reflect the increased volatility observed since the regime shift.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 189 units per period (P16-P25), compared to the ~100 units/period seen in the first 15 periods. Specifically, the last five periods (P21-P25) have shown consistent demand levels of 180, 189, 187, 203, and 180 (Mean ~188). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 243, with 692 units in-transit. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to specifically capture this higher demand regime that began at Period 16, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~190 units/period demand while covering the 4+1 period lead time horizon. This maintains a high service level for the $19 profit margin while accounting for the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3349.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16 and has stabilized. For the last 6 periods (P21-P26), demand has averaged 187.67 units (180, 189, 187, 203, 180, 187). This confirms a sustained new mean. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on recent arrivals (P22-P26 arrivals all show exactly 4 periods). On-hand inventory is 204, with 710 units in the pipeline. I will set L=4 (default), mu_hat (demand for L+1 periods) based on the recent 6 samples (N=6), and sigma_hat based on those same 6 samples to capture the current volatility accurately. This targets a high service level appropriate for a $19 profit / $1 holding cost ratio (q=95%), while the backend's capping mechanism will prevent over-ordering against the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-P16 shift has stabilized: P21-P26 average demand is 187.7 units/period with significantly lower volatility than the initial spike period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 16. Since then, demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the pre-Period 16 average (~100 units). Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 21-27), the average demand is 178.2 units per period. The last observation (Period 27) was 122 units, which is lower than the recent average, but we must maintain a base stock to cover (L+1) periods of the current 180-unit regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (253) and in-transit (595) total 848 units. With L=4, the system covers 5 periods of demand. Using N=7 for recent_N parameters captures the stabilized post-spike regime while excluding the extreme volatility of the initial transition period (P16-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2515.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from a baseline of ~100 units/period to a higher level. While the initial spike reached 273 units, recent history (Periods 21-28) shows a more stable average. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 8 periods (P21-P28) is 174.4 units/period. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. My strategy is to use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this stabilized post-shift demand mean and variance accurately. This ensures that the base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) is calculated using the updated 174.4 average, while accounting for the current on-hand inventory (278) and in-transit units (563) to avoid over-ordering now that stock levels have recovered from the P16-P20 stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-shift (P21-P28) has stabilized at a mean of 174.4 units/period, lower than the initial spike but ~75% higher than the original baseline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly since the spike in Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable phase from Period 21 to Period 29, the average demand is 179.3 units per period (180, 189, 187, 203, 180, 187, 122, 147, 219). This is a distinct regime compared to the chaotic Period 16-20 interval. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 260 and 491 units in-transit (orders from P26, P27, P28, P29), the pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-shift behavior while excluding the initial extreme volatility of the regime change. This will target an inventory level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), accounting for the current mean of ~179 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime post-shift (P21-P29) is stable with a mean of 179.3 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Analyzing the recent stable period from Period 21 to Period 30, the mean demand is approximately 181.9 units per period ( [180+189+187+203+180+187+122+147+219+205]/10 ). This is consistently higher than the pre-Period 16 average of ~100. The standard deviation during this same P21-P30 interval is approximately 30.5. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods according to consecutive arrivals (P26 order arriving at P30). I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable, post-shift regime. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~0.95 quantile), which is appropriate given the history of stockouts during the initial demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21-30 has settled at a mean of ~182 units/period, down from the initial spike but sustained at ~80% above baseline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (Periods 21-31), the average demand is 185.7 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 31) was 227 units, suggesting the regime remains elevated. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently low (50 units) after a high-demand period, but there is a significant pipeline in-transit (725 units). To maintain service levels for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set the demand forecast based on the last 11 periods (the post-spike stable regime) to capture the current mean and volatility. Using 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend uses the relevant history since the shift stabilized.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16. Since Period 21, the demand has settled into a higher-mean, higher-variance state compared to the initial baseline. From Period 21 to Period 32 (the last 12 samples), the mean demand is approximately 187 units/period. The most recent demand (Period 32) was 177 units. On-hand inventory is currently low (13 units), but there is a substantial pipeline of 821 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sustained demand pattern over the last 12 periods, I am choosing N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-shift regime without being overly influenced by the initial volatile spike (Periods 16-20). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption rates while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2698.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 16. Since Period 21, demand has stabilized at a significantly higher level than the initial baseline. Calculating the average demand from Period 21 to Period 33 yields approximately 183.5 units per period. The recent history shows a minor stockout in Period 33 due to the pipeline delay and sustained demand. To ensure we meet the current demand regime's requirements, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 13 periods (P21-P33) to capture this stable, higher-demand phase. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is also set using the same recent window to reflect the current volatility accurately. This approach ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the ~80% increase in demand compared to the start of the game, while balancing the holding cost against the high profit margin ($19.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 33 is stable at a mean of ~184 units/period, representing a sustained shift from the original baseline (~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4153.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 21 following the significant spike in Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 21-34), the average demand is approximately 186.2 units per period. The recent demand (P30: 205, P31: 227, P32: 177, P33: 160, P34: 219) remains consistent with this elevated level compared to the pre-P16 baseline (~100). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P26-P30. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=14 (P21-P34) to capture this stable post-shift mean while filtering out the initial volatility of the transition. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect current variance. On-hand inventory is very low (8 units), but a large in-transit pipeline (795 units) is expected to cover upcoming demand, as the base-stock policy will account for these scheduled arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 34 is stable at a mean of ~186 units/period, maintaining the ~85% increase from the original baseline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 21 following a significant spike in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 21 to Period 35, the mean demand is approximately 186.8 units per period, which is significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~100. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (16 units), but the pipeline inventory is substantial (800 units), consisting of orders from Periods 32, 33, 34, and 35. I will set mu_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15, covering P21-P35) to capture this stable, higher demand level accurately. Period 36 order will aim to maintain the pipeline to cover the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods (expected demand ~934 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 35 is stable at a mean of ~187 units/period, confirming a sustained ~87% increase over the original baseline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 21. Analyzing the window from Period 21 to Period 36, the average demand is 189.1 units per period. The most recent three periods (P34-P36) show demands of 219, 221, and 212, suggesting a slight upward drift or a tightening of the mean around 210-220, but the broader post-shift average remains safer for forecasting to avoid excessive holding costs given the current in-transit volume. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is low (40), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (798 units). I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering the stable regime from P21-P36) to capture this established higher demand level while filtering out the initial transition volatility from P16-P20. This allows the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock for the current ~190 units/period demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 36 is stable with a mean of 189.1 units/period, maintaining the ~90% increase over the original baseline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has remained stable with a mean of 189.1 units/period (based on P21-P36). Period 37 demand was 182, consistent with this level. On-hand inventory is 57. The 'In-transit' quantity of 817 units reflects orders from Periods 34, 35, 36, and 37 (131+234+234+218=817), which are all within the 4-period lead time. Arrivals have been consistent with the promised lead time of 4. I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering Period 21 to current) to capture the stable post-shift demand characteristics while avoiding the initial spike volatility in Periods 16-20. Lead time remains at the default (promised) value of 4 as observed arrivals are perfectly on schedule.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized significantly since the shift at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 21 to Period 38, the mean demand is approximately 189 units per period (3402 total units / 18 periods). Recent demand in Period 38 was 203. The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to a slight stockout in Period 38 (demand 203 vs available 188). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P34 order arrived P38). I will set L to 'calculate' to use the observed average. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering the stable period from P21 to P38) to capture the higher mean and the current volatility of this regime, ensuring the inventory target reflects the ~189 mean while accounting for recent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4326.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 39, the average demand is approximately 191 units per period, consistently higher than the initial baseline of ~100. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a slightly higher average of 210 units (219, 221, 212, 182, 203, 228). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 6 units on hand and a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), maintaining sufficient inventory is crucial. I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering the stable high-demand regime from P21 onwards) to ensure the base stock is calculated based on this sustained shift, effectively covering the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 39 is stable with a mean of 191.1 units/period, roughly 90% higher than the original baseline of 100.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since the shift at Period 16, with a more consistent mean since Period 21. For Period 41, I am using the data from Period 21 to Period 40 (N=20) to calculate parameters. The mean demand in this window is 191.1 units/period, and the lead time is consistently 4 periods. The inventory position is currently tight (on-hand is 45), but there is a significant amount in transit (823 units), including orders from P37 (218), P38 (176), P39 (190), and P40 (239). The order arriving in P41 (placed P37) is 218 units, which should satisfy the upcoming demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stabilized mean and volatility of this new regime while excluding the high-variance transition period (P16-P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4937.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 21. For Period 42, I am analyzing the demand from Period 21 to Period 41. The mean demand for this segment is 196.1 units per period, which aligns with the trend observed in the carry-over insights showing a sustained 90%+ increase from the baseline. Period 41 saw a spike to 260 units, which is high but within the volatility profile of this regime. I will use recent_N with N=21 (from Period 21 to 41) to capture this stable post-shift mean and variance. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the latest arrival (ordered P37, arrived P41). On-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but the pipeline is substantial (799 units), including an order from Period 38 (176 units) expected to arrive in the current period resolution. The parameters L=4, mu_hat (based on N=21), and sigma_hat (based on N=21) will allow the OR backend to maintain the required service level for this high-margin product.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 41 is stable with a mean of 196.1 units/period, representing a sustained shift approximately 95% higher than the original baseline of 100.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since the shift around Period 16. Analyzing the recent 22-period window (P21-P42), the average demand is approximately 196.1 units per period, which aligns with the observed 95% increase from the original baseline. While there was a slight further increase in the mean toward the end of this window, the 'recent_N' approach with N=22 captures the sustained higher average and increased volatility efficiently. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the consistent 'arrived' messages in history). With an on-hand inventory of only 1 unit and a significant pipeline (869 units), the goal is to maintain a high base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the current demand level and variance. I am using recent_N=22 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the post-shift environment starting Period 21.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 21 to Period 43 has a mean of approximately 201.2 units/period (total 4628 units / 23 periods), which is a slight increase from the previous average of 196.1 reported in Period 42. Recent data (P41: 260, P42: 178, P43: 218) shows some volatility but confirms the sustained higher demand compared to the initial baseline of 100. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 893 units in-transit. To ensure the inventory covers the L+1 window (5 periods) during this high-demand phase, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=23 (covering the start of the stabilized regime at P21) to capture the current mean of ~201 units. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 43 is stable with a mean of 201.2 units/period, roughly 100% higher than the original baseline of 100.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 44, the average demand is 196.1 units per period, showing a sustained shift from the original baseline of ~100. Recent periods (P40-P44) show demand values of 195, 260, 178, 218, and 170, suggesting a slightly higher but volatile mean. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as evidenced by the P40 order arriving in P44). Given we are near the end of the simulation (Period 45 of 50) and have 849 units in-transit (covering roughly 4.3 periods of demand at the 196 avg), I will maintain the base stock level using the recently stabilized mean to ensure high service level without excessive holding costs for the final periods. I am using recent_N=24 to capture the entire stable regime post-Period 21 shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 44 is stable with a mean of 196.1 units/period, representing a sustained shift approximately 95% higher than the original baseline of 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4257.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime following a shift around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (Period 21 to Period 45), the mean demand is approximately 196.7 units per period. The inventory position currently shows 37 units on hand and 819 units in transit. The lead time remains constant at the promised 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival history (e.g., Period 41 order arrived in Period 45). To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=25 to capture the full breadth of the current demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock level that reflects the ~100% increase from the original baseline while accounting for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 45 is stable with a mean of 196.7 units/period, maintaining the ~97% increase over the original baseline of 100.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 46, the average demand is approximately 196.7 units per period, which is nearly double the initial baseline of ~100. Recent periods (P41-P46) show demand values of 260, 178, 218, 170, 226, and 229, maintaining this elevated level. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the Period 42 order in Period 46. To address the backend OR logic, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=26 to capture the entire duration of the current stabilized high-demand regime (starting from Period 21). This provides a robust estimate of both the mean and the volatility while filtering out the noise from the initial spike in Period 16. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the backend uses the consistently observed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3732.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 21, with a secondary slight uptick around Period 40. For Period 48, I am analyzing the demand from Period 21 to Period 47, which shows a mean of 200.2 units per period. The last 10 periods (P38-P47) show a slightly higher mean of 211.7. Given the impending end of the simulation (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory. The lead time has consistently stayed at 4 periods. Since orders placed now (P48) will arrive after the game ends (P48+4=52), and orders placed in P44, P45, P46, and P47 are already in transit to cover the remaining periods, the parameter settings focus on maintaining the current service level for the remaining two periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 27 to capture the full stable regime since Period 21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 47 is stable with a mean of 200.2 units/period, representing a 100% increase over the original baseline of 100.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 48, the mean demand is approximately 198 units per period, which is a 100% increase over the original baseline of ~100. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 60 units with 831 units in transit (orders from P45, P46, P47, P48 are expected in P49, P50 and beyond). Since this is Period 49 and the game ends at 50, the priority is to maintain inventory for the final period while managing holding costs. I will use the recent 28 periods (P21-P48) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable high-demand regime, ensuring L is set to the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to Period 48 is stable with a mean of 197.8 units/period, confirming a sustained ~100% increase over the original baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4256.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 49, the average demand is 197.8 units per period, consistently about double the original baseline. Most recently, Period 49 showed a demand of 237, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0), though an arrival of 164 units did occur. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the stable high-demand period (N=29, from P21 to P49) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current reality without being overly skewed by the early low-demand history. This will maintain a high service level for this high-margin product.
