Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which are technically future samples in a literal sense but provided as historical seed data) are: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89. The mean of these 5 samples is 101.8. Given L=4, the exposure period is (1+L) = 5 periods. I will set the base stock parameters to cover this demand. Using 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the mean of 101.8 units/period. For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the volatility of these initial samples. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock approximately equal to 5 * 101.8 plus a safety stock buffer.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 149 units. Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start observation). We started with 0 inventory, so the demand of 91 in Period 1 was lost. The demand history provided (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) has a mean of 101.8. Given the promised lead time (L=4), the inventory needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using the 'default' method for mu_hat would calculate (1+4) * mean_all. Since the sample size is small (5 items) and we are just starting, the default statistical calculation is appropriate. I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to establish a baseline based on the provided history.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are currently in-transit (total 292). Based on the lead time definition (L=4), the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6's decision phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales because the initial stock was 0. The demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) show a mean of 101.8. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1=5 periods. Currently, 292 units are in transit, which roughly covers 2.8 periods of demand (292 / 101.8). The OR backend will calculate the order needed to reach the base stock level. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the available historical sample set including the pre-game data provided.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4 sequence: P1 ordered -> P5 arrival resolution -> P6 observation). This explains why the 'arrived' count is still 0 in the Period 1-3 concludes. There is no evidence of lost shipments yet. Historical demand samples (p1-p5: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89) average ~101.8. However, observed demand in the game history (p1-p3: 91, 130, 114) averages ~111.7. Given the inventory is currently 0 and on-hand/sold counts reflect stockouts, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use the more recent and slightly higher demand trend from the 'conclude' messages to parameterize mu_hat. I'll use L=4 (promised) and current sample mean (~102) to set base targets, but slightly adjust for the recent higher observations.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase (after this decision). Since actual lead time can only be confirmed from 'conclude' messages and we have not reached Period 5 conclude yet, we cannot confirm any arrivals. Current on-hand is 0, logic dictates we will likely have stockouts until the Period 1 order arrives. The historical demand for periods 1-5 (including the value provided in the prompt's summary for P5) are 141, 118, 67, 94, 89 (mean: 101.8). However, the conclude messages show demand as 91, 130, 114, 118. Using the conclude message demand data for the first 4 periods (mean: 113.25, std: 16.5) and the promised lead time L=4, I will set parameters to cover demand for L+1 periods. I'll use 'default' for L as no shifts are confirmed. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (4) as the regime appears stable.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the lead time is exactly 4 periods as promised (L=4). Historical demand data provided (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) and recorded demand from the game history (91, 130, 114, 118, 106) show relative stability. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (Game History) is 111.8. Current inventory status reflects on-hand: 43 and in-transit: 448. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5. With a lead time of 4, the order from Period 2 is expected to arrive during Period 6 (visible in Period 7). The base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using all 5 available samples from the game history provides a stable baseline for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Concluded history confirms actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 140, with 401 in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Demand history (6 measurements available: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46) shows a mean of approximately 101. The last data point (46) is significantly lower than previous periods, but it's too early to call a regime shift. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture recent fluctuations while maintaining stability. The OR backend will use L=4 to calculate base stock for (L+1)=5 periods. Profit $4 and Holding $1 implies a target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data for Period 5, 6, and 7 confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has been relatively stable with some variance. Historical demand samples (provided and concluded) are: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89 (pre-game) and 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86 (game history). The mean demand over these 12 samples is approximately 100 units. Since there is no clear evidence of a regime shift or strong seasonality yet, I will use a period of 7 for recent_N to capture the mean and variance from the actual game history, which seems slightly more representative than the initial samples. With L=4, the base stock will cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~500 units). On-hand is 186 and In-transit is 304 (total pipeline 490), so the system will place a small adjustment order to maintain the service level while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the available demand history shows relative stability with an average demand of approximately 99 units per period (samples: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103). The most recent period demand (103) is slightly above the mean, though Period 6 saw a notable drop (46). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, 7, and 8 concludes). Current inventory positions are healthy: On-hand is 224 and In-transit is 219 (comprising orders from P5=32, P6=96, P7=35, P8=56). Since the 'chips(Regular)' exhibit stable demand without clear regime shifts or seasonal trends in this early stage, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the full observed demand history) to capture the variance appropriately. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are consistently matching the promised 4 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the history (Periods 1-9), the average demand is 99.1 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P6-P9) show demands of 46, 86, 103, and 98, demonstrating some variance but no clear regime shift away from the long-term mean. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and all completed arrivals (Orders from P1 to P5) have arrived exactly in 4 periods, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4. With L=4, the OR backend needs to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 500 units. Currently, we have 158 units on-hand and 289 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 447). The system is slightly below the target base stock, but the current inventory is healthy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full observed demand history since the start, and 'calculate' for lead time to use the confirmed 4-period timing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $431.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Analysis of the first 10 periods of demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 103 units per period (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103, 98, 137). There is a slight outlier in Period 6 (46 units), but otherwise, demand is relatively stable within the 80-140 range. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 6 (all arriving exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 117 units, and in-transit inventory is 287 units (from orders in Periods 7, 8, 9, 10). The OR backend uses L to calculate the protection period (L+1). With the promised and actual lead time both at 4, setting L=4 covers 5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_5' for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the most recent fluctuations (avg ~94) and 'default' for sigma_hat (standard deviation) to maintain a cautious safety stock given the moderate volatility.

We are at Period 12. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 101 units per period (last 11 periods: 91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103, 98, 137, 86). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the concluded data (Orders from P1 to P7 all arrived with lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is 66, and in-transit is 367. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P8 (56), P9 (102), P10 (94), and P11 (115). Since lead time is 4, the order from P8 is expected to arrive during P12. The OR backend needs parameters to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been stable at 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full recent demand profile, which averages ~101/period. This will set a base stock around 500-600 units, which, minus the pipeline (367), will trigger an appropriate replenishment order to maintain service levels without excessive holding costs.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current system state shows 35 units on-hand and 432 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P12). The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P1-P12 mean ~100.25). Using a recent_N (N=8) approach for demand captures the most recent consumption behavior (P5-P12 avg ~93.6) which is slightly lower than the initial window but provides a safer buffer. Since the promised lead time of 4 periods is perfectly matching historical arrivals, I will use 'default' for L. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat * sqrt(1+L). With L=4, this covers 5 periods of demand. Given profit $4 and holding $1, the critical ratio q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8, which is adequately served by standard deviations.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Historically, for chips(Regular), the lead time is extremely stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5 through P13). Current on-hand inventory is 19 units, and there are 380 units in-transit (ordered in P10, P11, P12, and P13). The demand over the last 13 periods shows a mean of approximately 100.3 units (sum=1304/13) and a standard deviation of approximately 24.3. No major demand shifts or seasonality are evident from the provided 'Period_X' dates. The backend OR engine uses a base-stock policy. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, translated to a z-score of ~0.84. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the most stable recent demand profile for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so 'default' is appropriate.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15. Historical demand over the first 14 periods shows a relatively stable mean around 102 units/period (total 1431/14). Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P10 arrived P14). On-hand inventory is very low (2 units), meaning we are heavily dependent on incoming shipments. In-transit inventory stands at 426 units, representing orders from Periods 11 (115), 12 (121), 13 (50), and 14 (140). The order from Period 11 (115 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 15, which will provide buffer for current demand. Since the demand process appears stable with no evidence of regime shifts or seasonality (given generic period names), I will use the recent_N method for demand parameters with N=14 to capture all observed demand data. This balances our service level (profit=$4, holding=$1 implies a high critical ratio) against the pipeline of 426 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Period 5 through Period 15, with all completed cycles showing exactly 4 periods. Therefore, L is set to 'default'. Demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, with samples from the last 15 periods ranging between 46 and 137. The last 5 samples (118, 111, 77, 86, 87) show a slight downward trend compared to the earlier history, so I am using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent behavior while maintaining a sufficient sample size to smooth out volatility. This provides a balance between meeting demand and managing the holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0). Starting on-hand is 40, and in-transit is 438, which should cover the pipeline for the next 4 periods given average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $644.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand surged unexpectedly to 273 units, compared to a historical average of approximately 100-110 units. This surge resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 12. Currently, there are 361 units in transit (ordered in Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16). Given the lead time L=4, the pipeline inventory must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The recent demand spike (273) significantly skews the average. I will use a recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the spike while acknowledging the previous stable regime. Since the spike might be an outlier or a new trend, I will set sigma_hat to recent_N=5 to account for the increased variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 16 (273 units vs previous avg ~105).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18 and currently facing a stockout with 0 units on-hand. A significant demand spike started in Period 16 (273 units) and continued in Period 17 (170 units), far exceeding the previous average of ~105. This suggests a demand regime shift or a strong seasonal event. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have experienced two consecutive periods of high demand and are now out of stock, I must use an explicit forecast to account for this higher demand level during the lead-time window ((1+L) * forecasted_demand). I am estimating the new mean demand at approximately 200 units per period based on the average of the last two spikes (273 and 170). For L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 200 = 1000. For sigma_hat, I am increasing the volatility estimate to account for the sudden shift and the high variance of the spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~105 to ~200+ starting Period 16 (P16: 273, P17: 170).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. A significant upward demand regime shift occurred starting in Period 16. Demand for the last three periods has been 273, 170, and 232 (mean ~225), compared to the previous baseline of ~105. Due to this spike, we have stocked out for three consecutive periods (ending on-hand inventory is 0). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have zero inventory and are facing a higher demand regime, we need the OR backend to recalculate using only the most recent data (the last 3 samples) to set the base stock high enough to cover the new demand level across the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). We use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased mean and volatility of this new regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the last 4 periods (P16-P19), demand has been 273, 170, 232, and 116, averaging ~198 units per period compared to the previous average of ~105. Despite the dip in Period 19 (116), the overall trend and stockouts in Periods 16, 17, and 18 justify maintaining a high base stock. The on-hand inventory is very low (11 units) and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (931 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P15 order arrived in P19). For OR parameters, I'm using 'calculate' for Lead Time to leverage the consistent 4-period history, and 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift that occurred 4 periods ago. This ensures the backend calculates parameters based on the current higher-volume/higher-volatility environment (L+1 = 5 periods of demand coverage).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Recent demand samples are: P16: 273, P17: 170, P18: 232, P19: 116, P20: 164. The mean of these last 5 periods is approximately 191 units. The on-hand inventory is 0, meaning we are currently stock-out constrained despite arrivals. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the significantly higher mean and variance of this new regime. This will set a base stock level that targets (1 + L) * 191 units, helping to catch up with the increased demand profile and prevent future stock-outs while accounting for the current in-transit pipeline of 1064 units. The OR backend will automatically calculate the base stock and order amount based on the provided lead time and recent demand statistics.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~105 to approximately 189 over the last 6 periods (P16-P21 demand: 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180). Although the mean is around 189, the variability is high, and the high demand caused significant stockouts (sold < demand in P16, P17, P18, P20). Our lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (1+L)=5 periods. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures this new higher-demand regime effectively. For sigma_hat, recent_N=6 captures the increased volatility associated with the demand spike and subsequent shift. This will help the backend maintain a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high in-transit pipeline (807 units).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from an average of ~105 to approximately 189 over the last 7 periods (P16-P22). Specifically, recent demand samples are: 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. We currently have 207 units on hand and 654 in transit (orders from P19, P20, P21, P22). To capture the new demand regime, I am set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=7, covering the period since the spike. This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level using the higher mean (~189) and the increased volatility observed in this period, ensuring sufficient stock for the (L+1)=5 period horizon while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the product 'chips(Regular)' continues in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 16 to 23 shows a mean of approximately 190.1 units per period (273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189, 187). Currently, on-hand inventory is 331 units, and pipeline inventory is 523 units (sum of orders from P20-P23: 177+8+158+180=523). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current high-demand regime) to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the increased mean (~190) and the higher volatility observed during this shift to prevent stockouts while managing the cost of the currently high on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $507.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~105 units to ~190 units (average demand from P16 to P24 is 190.4). I will use a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat starting from the changepoint (N=9). Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments; thus, 'calculate' is the most robust method for L. The inventory levels (on-hand 305 + in-transit 525) are currently high because large orders placed during the initial spike (P18-P19) have arrived, but since demand remains high (~190-200), we must maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of this elevated demand. The 'recent_N' approach will naturally capture the higher mean and increased volatility of the current regime, allowing the OR backend to set a sufficient safety stock for the regular chips SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~190 units (measured P16-P24) compared to the initial avg of ~105.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting in Period 16. Previously averaging ~105 units/period, the demand since P16 has stabilized at a higher level. Analysis of the last 10 periods (P16-P25) shows a mean demand of 189.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 40.5 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Since the inventory levels (on-hand + in-transit) are currently high due to recent large orders catching up with the demand spike, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to accurately reflect the current high-demand regime without over-ordering based on the earlier low-demand phase. Lead time (L) remains at the default/promised 4 periods as observed in recent 'conclude' messages.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 27. The product is 'chips(Regular)'. Based on history, a significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 16. The demand increased from a mean of ~105 to approximately 190. Analysis of recent demand (P16 to P26) shows: 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189, 187, 203, 180, 187. Excluding the initial spike of 273, the mean over the last 10 periods (P17-P26) is approximately 181 units, while the mean over the last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 189.2 units. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (promised lead time). I will use recent_N with N=10 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the stable period of the new high-demand regime while smoothing out the initial surge. This ensures our base stock level reflects the current average demand of ~180-190 units across the L+1 cycle.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 16, moving from an average of ~105 to a higher stabilized mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 27 (the last 12 periods), the mean is approximately 184 units per period (273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189, 187, 203, 180, 187, 122). Although Period 27 showed a dip to 122, it is too early to call a downward shift. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P20-P23 orders). To set the OR parameters, I will use a recent window of N=12 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) is calculated against the current mean of ~184 rather than the long-term historical average, while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $394.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable period (P16 to P28), the mean demand is approximately 181 units/period. The standard deviation in this period is roughly 41 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed deliveries (P1 through P24 orders have all arrived exactly 4 periods later). Current on-hand inventory (194) and in-transit units (657) sum to 851. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). A base stock target of roughly 1100 units (181 * 5 + safety stock) is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering P16-P28) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand phase.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~105 to approximately 190. Recent demand (last 14 periods, P16-P29) averages 181. However, the four most recent periods (P26-P29) show a slightly lower average of 168. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will use a conservative N=14 for mu_hat to capture the post-shift average while smoothing recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the increased volatility (std dev in this period is approx 42). This ensures we maintain a base stock that covers the elevated demand regime during the 5-period lead time + review cycle (L+1=5).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 16 from an average of ~105 to a higher level. Looking at Period 25-30, demand has been 180, 187, 122, 147, 219, and 205. The average over these last 6 periods is 176.7. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime that stabilized around Period 16, which provides a sample size of 15 (P16-P30). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. We have 146 units on hand and 645 in transit, which is a healthy pipeline for a lead time of 4. Setting parameters based on the last 15 periods will ensure the OR backend maintains a base stock that reflects the current high-demand environment (~180-200 units/period).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~105 to approximately 180-200 units. Recent demand (P28-P31: 147, 219, 205, 227) confirms this higher level, with a 4-period mean of ~199.5. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31). With an on-hand inventory of 40 and 734 units in-transit (covering orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 16 samples (N=16, from P16 to P31) to capture this 'high demand' regime accurately while ignoring the early low-demand period. This helps the OR engine maintain a sufficient base stock level for the current 200-unit-per-period demand environment.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an initial mean of ~105 to a higher mean. Analyzing the period from P16 to P32 (17 samples), the mean demand is approximately 186.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 40.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. Current on-hand inventory is low (23 units), but there is a significant pipeline (814 units) to cover future demand. Since the demand has stabilized at this new level for 17 periods, I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the characteristics of this current demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will continue to use the calculated lead time which has shown high stability at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) successfully transitioned to a higher regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is approximately 183 units with a standard deviation of 33. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there is a significant pipeline of 854 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Orders from P30 (232 units), P31 (210 units), P32 (240 units), and P33 (172 units) are in transit and expected to arrive in P34, P35, P36, and P37 respectively. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stabilized higher demand (approx 183/period) and volatility (approx 33/period) to set the base stock for the (L+1) horizon. Setting N=10 balances responsiveness to the recent regime while maintaining statistical robustness.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 16. In the most recent 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is approximately 184.1 units, following the initial shift from ~105 to ~190. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by every concluded order. Currently, we have 13 units on-hand and 744 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory is quite high (it includes orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34, totaling 744 units). With an average demand of ~185, a 5-period window (L+1) requires approximately 925 units. Since 13 + 744 = 757, the OR backend will place an order to bridge the gap to the base stock. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stabilized higher demand regime (P25-P34) and set lead time to 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16 and has remained in a higher regime. For the last 20 periods (P16-P35), the average demand is approximately 192 units. Most recently (P30-P35), demand has been even higher, averaging 210 units. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as using the full history would underestimate demand and lead to stockouts. The lead time has consistently stayed at 4 periods, which is the promised lead time; therefore, I will use the default method for L. On-hand inventory is currently very low (2 units), so the priority is ensuring the pipeline inventory (764 units) is sufficient to cover the (L+1)=5 period lead time demand, which at 200 units/period is roughly 1000 units. The OR backend will order the difference between the base stock and the pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an initial mean of ~105 to a current sustained mean of approximately 194.5 (analyzed over Periods 25-36). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 30, demand has consistently been around 200-230 units (mean for last 7 periods is 206). To ensure sufficient service level (Profit $4, Holding $1 results in a high critical fractile of 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility. I have chosen N=12 to capture the full landscape of the 'high demand' regime (P25-P36) while smoothing out recent fluctuations. This will ensure mu_hat reflects the current stabilized mean (~195) and captures the moderate volatility seen in the current era.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~195 units/period starting Period 25 (confirmed by Period 36 data). Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 195 units per period since Period 25. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (20 units), but there is a significant pipeline (810 units). For Period 38, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the stable demand period from P25 to P37 (13 samples). This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant mean and volatility to calculate the base stock level, effectively bridging the shift from the historical average of ~105 to the current ~195.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 25, with an average of approximately 195 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0, following a period where demand (203) exceeded available stock (142), resulting in lost sales. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P34 order arriving in P38 conclude). The 'In-transit' pipeline contains 864 units (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38), which is sufficient to cover approximately 4.4 periods of demand at the current rate. To maintain a high service level (optimal q \u2248 0.8) while accounting for the inventory depletion in P38, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=14 (the length of the current stable regime starting at P25). This will allow the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock and base stock level to replenish on-hand inventory while accounting for the proven 4-period lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we observe that demand has remained stable within the higher regime identified around Period 25. The recent demand mean (since Period 25) is approximately 198 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 29 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Despite the on-hand inventory being low (2 units), the in-transit inventory is high (779 units), covering several periods of future demand. I will use a N=14 window for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the stable behavior of the current regime while excluding the initial low-demand phase and the transitional spike. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock level sufficient to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1) while balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 25, with a mean demand of approximately 198 units/period (calculated from P25-P40). Recent demand history (P36-P40) supports this, with values of 212, 182, 203, 228, and 195. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in all recent concluded periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 57 and in-transit is 777. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 41/50), we must ensure we cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end. Setting L to 4 (promised/actual), mu_hat to 990 (approx 198 * 5) using recent_N (N=16 for the current regime), and sigma_hat to the recent standard deviation to handle volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a stabilized regime around 200 units per period. Recent demands (P38-P41) are 203, 228, 195, and 260, averaging ~221.5, which is slightly higher than the previous stabilization point of 195. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P37 order in P41. In-transit inventory is high (757 units), but on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) following a high demand period (260). I will use a recent_N approach (N=17, covering the period from P25 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand accurately while accounting for the recent variability. This N-value ensures we include the relevant data since the last major stabilization point identified in carry-over insights.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 25. Analyzing the last 18 periods (P25-P42), the average demand is approximately 196.5 units, with a standard deviation of 30.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 42 of the order placed in Period 38 (lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), but the in-transit pipeline is substantial (834 units), which includes orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42. To maintain a high service level (95%+ as targeted by the backend OR logic given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the current stable high-demand regime, and keep L at default since the lead time is stable.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 25, averaging approximately 195-205 units per period. Recent data (P39-P43) shows periodic stockouts and high demand (P41: 260, P43: 218). The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P39 order arrived in P43). I am currently at zero on-hand inventory with a pipeline of 893 units. Given the high demand and the stockout in P43, I need to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the recent mean of ~205. I will use recent_N (N=19, covering the stable regime from P25 to P43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand and its volatility accurately, while maintaining L at the calculate method to reflect the stable 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~200 units/period since Period 25 (confirmed through Period 43). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable around a mean of 200 units per period since Period 25. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is 198.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently realized (last observation: P40 order arrived in P44). As we are approaching the final periods (P45 of 50), it is critical to maintain service levels while being mindful of ending inventory. The OR backend uses L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to set the base stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (approximately 200 units/period) while filtering out the earlier lower-demand history. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is calculated against a mean of ~1000 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 202 units since Period 25, with periodic fluctuations (std ~30). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 37-41 consistently showing a 4-period duration. We are currently at Period 46, and the game ends at Period 50. Inventory is low (40 units), with 819 units in-transit. For Period 46, an order placed now will arrive in Period 50 (after the Period 50 decision, during arrival resolution), which is the final period of the game. This order will be available to satisfy Period 50's demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stable regime starting from Period 25. L is set to 'default' (4), which ensures the base stock covers demand for 5 periods (L+1). This strategy maintains a high service level for the remaining periods while preventing excessive holding costs at the game's end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $852.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at approximately 200 units per period since Period 25. Analyzing the last 21 periods (P25-P46), the average demand is 198 units with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), the goal is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Current pipeline inventory is 758 units, and on-hand is 64, totaling 822 units. Given there are 4 periods left (including current), and average demand is ~200, we expect to need ~800 units total. Since the current inventory position (822) already covers the expected demand for the remainder of the game, I will maintain parameters that reflect the current stable regime to ensure the OR backend manages the tail-end of the simulation efficiently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $732.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since orders placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52 (after the game ends), the priority is managing existing inventory to cover the remaining periods (P48, P49, P50). Demand has been stable around ~200 units since Period 25. Recent demand samples (P44-P47: 170, 226, 229, 200) result in an average of 206.25 units. Since there are only 3 demand events remaining (P48, P49, P50), and we have 68 on-hand plus 790 in-transit (orders from P44-P47 which will arrive in P48-P51), we are well-covered. Specifically, the order from P44 (153 units) arrives during P48, P45 (209 units) arrives during P49, and P46 (192 units) arrives during P50. Total expected availability for the last 3 periods is 68 + 153 + 209 + 192 = 622 units against a forecast of ~600 units. I will use recent_N (N=23, reflecting the stable regime since P25) for demand mean and volatility to maintain the base stock logic, but the capped policy will naturally limit excessive ordering for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $794.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~200 units since Period 25. Looking at the most recent 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is 210.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistently accurate based on the arrival history (P44 order arrived in P48). Currently, in Period 49, the on-hand inventory is 18 units and there is a significant pipeline of 831 units (orders from P45-P48 expected in P49-P52). To sustain availability and address the recent mean, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the total history, which includes the lower demand period (P1-P15). The lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Profit: $908.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $908.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 49 where demand (237) exceeded available stock (227). The demand regime remains stable around ~200 units/period since Period 25. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 25 to 49 is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of 30. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 877 units, which corresponds to the orders placed in Periods 46, 47, 48, and 49 (192+236+194+255=877). Since the order from Period 46 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 50, and we are currently at the decision phase, this pipeline is critical for coverage. Using recent_N=25 for mu_hat captures the stable regime since Period 25 (25 periods of data). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=25 to reflect the current volatility.
