Analyzing History: Initial demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) and recorded game demand (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46) suggest a mean demand of approximately 101 units per period. The Period 6 demand (46) is a significant downward outlier compared to the previous average, but it's too early to declare a new regime. Lead Time: The only arrival (Period 5) confirmed a lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 368. In-transit consists of orders from P3 (80), P4 (20), P5 (100), and P6 (100) totaling 300 units. Expected Arrivals: P3 order (80) should arrive in P7; P4 order (20) in P8; P5 order (100) in P9; P6 order (100) in P10. Forecast: Based on a lead time (L) of 4, I need to cover demand for Period 7 through Period 11 (L+1 = 5 periods). Estimated demand for 5 periods is ~505 units (using the mean of ~101). Current Pipeline (On-hand 368 + In-transit 300) = 668 units. Final Logic: Total inventory (668) already exceeds the 5-period demand forecast (505) by a healthy margin (safety stock of ~163 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), over-ordering is risky. I will skip ordering this period to let the existing pipeline bleed down.",

My lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. With only 8 periods remaining (ends at P50), I must balance the high service level needed to capture $4.0 profit against the risk of overstocking near the game's end at $1.0 holding cost. Current status: On-hand = 12, In-transit = 882 (P39: 190, P40: 290, P41: 162, P42: 240). Expected arrivals: P43 (from P39) = 190, P44 (from P40) = 290, P45 (from P41) = 162, P46 (from P42) = 240. Pipeline analysis: Total units to cover demand from P43 to P47 (L+1 periods) should be approximately 213 * 5 = 1065. Current pipeline (OH + IT) = 12 + 882 = 894. Gap = 171 units. To maintain safety stock and account for demand variability, I will order 210 units. This order will arrive in P47, leaving 3 periods (P48-P50) of demand remaining to be covered by future orders.",
