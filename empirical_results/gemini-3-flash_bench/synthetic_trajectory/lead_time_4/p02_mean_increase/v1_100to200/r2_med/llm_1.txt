There is high initial variance, but the last four periods average ~92. c) Lead Time: The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are at Period 1 (re-starting the simulation or entering the decision phase), I must account for the 4-period lead time. d) Inventory Assessment: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. My order in Period 1 will arrive at the start of Period 6 (visible in P6, usable for P6 demand). e) Strategy: I need to cover demand for Periods 1-5 with current stock (which is 0, so P1-P5 will likely result in lost sales unless there's an initial stock not listed) and ensure stock for Period 6. Since I have 0 inventory and 0 in-transit, I must place an order immediately to cover the lead time (4) + 1 period. Estimating demand at ~100 units/period, I need to build a pipeline. I will order 500 units to cover approximately 5 periods of demand starting from the arrival in P6.",

The average demand across all available data (7 samples) is approximately 103 units/period. c) Lead Time Analysis: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (500 units) are expected to arrive in Period 1+4=5. Orders placed in P2 (100 units) are expected in Period 2+4=6. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 0. Total units sold to date is 0 because arrivals haven't started. Inventory is effectively running on stockouts until the first shipment arrives. Total in-transit is 600. e) Order Logic: We need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (4+1=5). Total pipeline required = 103 units/period * 5 periods = 515 units. We currently have 600 units in transit, which covers the next 5-6 periods of expected demand. However, to maintain a rolling inventory and account for the 126 + 83 = 209 units of backlogged/lost sales (assuming some demand might be captured once stock arrives or simply to ensure no future gap), I will place a maintenance order. Given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4), I must avoid overstocking. Since pipeline (600) > required coverage (515), no large order is needed yet. I will order 100 units to maintain the pipeline for Period 7.",

I will forecast ~95 units per period. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4. My P1 order (500 units) is expected to arrive during P5 (concluding at P5, visible P6).

I have had three consecutive periods of lost sales (demand: 126+83+70=279 units) due to starting with 0 inventory and a 4-period lead time. e) Order Logic: To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~95 * 5 = 475), I already have 700 units in the pipeline. These 700 units will easily cover the next several periods once they start arriving in P5.

At an estimated demand of ~170-200 units per period, total required stock for the rest of the game is approximately 1190-1400 units.

Even at the high-volatility mean of ~210 units, total demand for the remaining 6 periods (P45-P50) is estimated at approximately 1260 units. With 1433 units already available or in transit, we have a surplus of over 170 units relative to the forecast.
