Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and a 4-period lead time, we must place an order immediately to cover demand in the upcoming periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 shows samples: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89. The mean of these 5 samples is 101.8. To ensure sufficient stock for the review period plus lead time (1+L = 5 periods), the expected demand (mu_hat) should be roughly 101.8 * 5 = 509. The standard deviation of these 5 samples is approximately 28.5, so sigma_hat should be sqrt(5) * 28.5 \u2248 63.7. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and variance captures the most relevant initial data points to set our base stock level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The game started with 0 inventory, even though we placed an order of 149 units in Period 1. Based on the lead time definition, since the promised lead time is 4 periods, an order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. The 0 sales in Period 1 were due to 0 starting inventory. In Period 2, we still have 0 on-hand inventory and 149 units in-transit. Demand history shows relatively high consumption (Mean: 101.8, range: 67-141). Since the system is currently in a 'stockout' recovery phase, I will use a 'recent_N' approach to capture the available history and allow the OR backend to calculate base-stock levels that account for current demand levels and the 4-period lead time. I'll use N=5 for demand to encompass all provided historical points.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 126 and 83 respectively (average ~104.5). The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) because orders from Period 1 and 2 have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which means the Order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 5 and become visible in Period 6. The current in-transit inventory is 287 (149 from P1 + 138 from P2). Since we have only 5 historical samples total and 2 'concluded' periods in the game history, the data is still stabilizing. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting, selecting N=5 to encompass all provided sample data (including the seed data) to establish a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4 sequence: order N, arrive N+L). Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for Periods 1-3, resulting in lost sales for all demand encountered so far. Total in-transit is 415 units (149 from P1, 138 from P2, 128 from P3). Demand has shown a downward trend (126, 83, 70), though 5 samples are provided in the context (141, 118, 67, 94, 89). Using the provided samples, the average demand is ~101.8. With L=4, the base stock should cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the recent variance while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, meaning they will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message read at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales because demand (which occurs after the decision phase) cannot be satisfied. Total in-transit is 502 units (149+138+128+87). Given there are no concluded arrivals yet, we cannot verify if the actual lead time differs from the promise. Demand history for 5 periods shows values: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89 (mean ~101.8). However, the internal 'Period X conclude' demand data shows slightly different historical values: 126, 83, 70, 105. I will use the recent_N method with N=4 to capture the most relevant demand mean and standard deviation for the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. L is set to default (4) as no evidence yet exists to suggest a lead-time shift.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109 (Mean = 98.6, Std Dev = 21.6). Note that historical samples provided in the prompt (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) differ slightly from the GAME HISTORY; I will prioritize the GAME HISTORY samples for statistical calculations. Currently, 40 units are on-hand, and 378 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all 5 available history samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The backend uses z* for the service level, which for Profit=4 and Holding=1 is \u03a6\u22121(4/(4+1)) = \u03a6\u22121(0.8) \u2248 0.84.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 105. We have 357 units in transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). Based on 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude', the actual lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6), which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 6 periods has been [126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73], averaging 94.3 units per period. There are no obvious seasonal trends yet. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and set mu_hat based on the average of all available demand samples (N=6) to cover the inventory needs for L+1 (5) periods. Sigma_hat is also set using all available samples to capture the historical volatility (std \u2248 21.3). This should maintain an appropriate buffer as the pipeline starts to deliver consistently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is [126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67], with an average of approximately 90.4. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Current inventory is 166 on-hand + 281 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). The total pipeline plus on-hand (447) needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Since 5 * 90.4 = 452, the current position is roughly aligned with average demand. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift visible in the first 7 periods for 'chips(Regular)'. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using all 7 available samples (N=7) to stabilize the forecast against the early volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'default' as the observed 4 periods matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods 5 through 8 confirms that orders placed in periods 1 through 4 all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods (as promised). Demand has shown some volatility: from periods 1-7, the mean demand was approx 90, but Period 8 saw a significant spike to 157. This could be a random outlier or the start of a trend. Given that total pipeline inventory (243) plus on-hand (96) equals 339 units, and the calculated base stock for a 4-period lead time (covering 5 periods of demand) at an average of 100 units/period is roughly 500-600 units, we need to maintain consistent ordering. I am using recent_N (N=8) for demand mean to incorporate the recent spike without overreacting, and explicit lead time L=4 based on confirmed historical data to ensure the backend uses the correct horizon.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 9 (all orders from Periods 1-5 arrived exactly after 4 periods). Therefore, L=4 is confirmed. Demand across the first 9 periods has shown some volatility but no clear structural regime shift yet (mean demand \u2248 100). Period 8 saw a spike (157), but Period 9 returned closer to the average (107). Current on-hand inventory is low (14), but we have 369 units in-transit, which includes the orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9 (117+52+49+151 = 369). The backend OR engine needs to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. I will use recent_N=9 for demand statistics to encompass all available historical data since start, as there is no strong evidence of a recent regime change, but sufficient data to move beyond a static prior.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Promissed lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms this (orders from P1-P6 all arrived with lead_time=4). Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable across the first 10 periods. The historical demand samples provided (P1-P5) and the concluding demand data (P1-P10) show a mean of approximately 98.7 units per period. The recent demand (last 5 periods: 73, 67, 157, 107, 90) averages 98.8, suggesting no significant regime shift. Current on-hand is 41 units, with 401 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the pipeline (401) + on-hand (41) = 442 is intended to cover the L+1 period window (5 periods), and 5 * 98.7 = 493.5, the system is slightly under-stocked relative to target base stock. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the full observed demand history while allowing for responsiveness to the slight volatility seen in Period 8. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable and well-documented.

Historical demand samples show a range of 67\u2013157, with an average of approximately 99 units per period. The backend needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1) to ensure sufficient stock until the next arrival. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 (all available data) provides a balanced estimate of ~495 total demand (99 * 5). For sigma_hat, using recent_N=11 captures the observed volatility to set an appropriate safety stock. Although in-transit is high (454), our on-hand is zero, and we need to maintain a continuous pipeline to avoid further stockouts.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing stockouts (On-hand: 0). Recent demand has stabilized. In Period 11 and 12, we sold 93/94 and 49/84 units respectively, with the sales being limited by on-hand inventory. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated through Period 12 conclude). Current inventory position: On-hand 0 + In-transit 493 = 493 units. Given L=4, the base stock targets coverage for 1+L = 5 periods. Mean demand from the last 12 periods is approximately 100 units/period (total demand 1205 / 12 periods). mu_hat should target ~500 units. Using recent_N=10 to capture the most stable demand regime while accounting for the recent stockouts which might indicate underlying demand is higher than 90-100. I will maintain L=4 via the calculate method as it matches the observed history exactly.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a stable actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 13 periods has averaged approximately 94.5 units (with a standard deviation of 30.6). In Period 13, demand dropped to 44, which is significantly lower than previous periods but may be a transient dip. Current on-hand inventory is 107, and in-transit inventory is 377. The total pipeline + on-hand is 484 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 94.5 = 472.5. We are currently well-covered by the pipeline. I will set the demand parameters using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture the more stable recent behavior while smoothing out the Period 13 outlier. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time has been consistent since P5.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 14 (all orders arrived exactly 4 periods after being placed). Demand over the first 14 periods shows a mean of approximately 98.1 units. Recently, demand has fluctuated (e.g., Period 14 spike to 145), but there is no sustained regime shift yet. Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation (N=10) focuses on the post-initial-startup distribution. The OR backend will calculate a base stock target covering (4+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 500 units), accounting for the current on-hand (111) and in-transit (255) inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $559.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed consistent lead times of exactly 4 periods (P1 through P11 arrivals followed this pattern). Demand has shown a significant upward trend in the last four periods (mean of ~107.0 in periods 12-15 vs previous mean). Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 304, consisting of orders from P12 (88), P13 (35), P14 (27), and P15 (154). We expect the P12 order (88 units) to arrive during the current Period 16 resolution. To account for the recent demand surge (P14: 145, P15: 155), I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to capture the higher mean while maintaining stability, and using the last 7 samples for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility. Method 'calculate' for L is used as the lead time has been perfectly stable at the promised value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected from Period 12: Average demand increased from ~90 to ~107 units (+20%) with higher volatility peaking at 155 units.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a high demand period (185 units in P16). A lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed. There is a confirmed demand regime shift starting around Period 12; mean demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has risen to ~122.6 units compared to the earlier average of ~96. More critically, the peak demand reached 185, and recent volatility is significantly higher. Given we have 381 units in transit (expected arrivals from P13, P14, P15, and P16 orders), we need to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to cover the increased demand mean and variance over the 5-period window (L+1). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the established 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified: Average demand for Period 12-16 increased to 122.6 (+27% from original) with a new peak of 185 units observed in Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stayed consistently high, confirming a regime shift that started around Period 12. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 12 to 17 has risen to approximately 129 units, compared to the earlier average of ~90. Recent peaks (185 and 162 units) indicate significantly higher volatility. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory and have faced stockouts in Period 16 and 17 because incoming shipments (based on older, lower demand forecasts) were insufficient. We have 563 units in-transit, but since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must set parameters that prevent future stockouts under this higher demand level. I will use a recent_N of 6 periods for mu_hat to capture the post-shift mean of ~129 (implying a mu_hat of ~645 for 1+L). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N to reflect the increased variance observed in these last 6 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: Periods 12-17 average demand is 129.2 units (+43% from baseline), with increased volatility peaking at 185 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand inventory and recent stockouts. The demand has entered a significant upward regime shift starting around Period 12. Between Period 12 and Period 18, the average demand has risen dramatically to approximately 140 units per period (84, 44, 145, 155, 185, 162, 205), with the last three periods all exceeding 160 units (avg of last 3 is 184). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on P14's arrival. I am choosing N=7 for mu_hat to capture this high-growth regime (P12-P18), and N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (peak 205). Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent 4-period history. This configuration aims to raise the base stock level to cover the increased demand and protect against the high variability observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift further intensified: Periods 15-18 average demand is 176.7 (+94% from baseline), peaking at 205 units in Period 18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift starting around Period 12, accelerating significantly from Period 15 onwards. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 182 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~90-100. We are currently facing high stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0 for the last four periods) because incoming shipments (ordered before the spike) are insufficient to meet this new 180+ unit/period demand level. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To stabilize the service level and address the stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime (5 * ~182 = 910). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility (Standard Deviation of P15-P19 is ~22.4). This will raise the base stock level to better cover the (L+1) window in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 15-19 average demand is 182 units, representing a >100% increase from the initial baseline of 90 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the product is in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 15. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 189.8 units, which is a significant increase from the initial baseline (~90). Due to this surge, on-hand inventory has been consistently depleted, resulting in stockouts even with arrivals. We need to set parameters based on this recent high-demand regime to ensure the OR backend calculated a sufficiently high base stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high mean and volatility levels without being Diluted by the much lower early-game data. This targets a service level dictated by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.8).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stabilized: Periods 16-20 average demand is 189.8 units (previously ~90), with consistent stockouts despite arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $868.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted to a higher level, with Period 21 recording a new peak of 244 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is approximately 201.6 units, up significantly from the baseline of ~90 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced consistent stockouts despite increasing arrival sizes. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover from this stockout position and meet the elevated demand, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). This should aggressively increase the order quantity to match the sustained demand levels observed since Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift further intensified: Average demand for Periods 17-21 increased to 201.6 units, with a new peak of 244 units observed in Period 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $731.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted upward from an initial baseline of ~90 units/period to approximately 205 units/period over the last 5 periods (Periods 18-22). Specifically, demand in the recent window has been 205, 203, 194, 244, and 183. The average for these 5 periods is 205.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P18 order arrived in P22). With an on-hand inventory of only 1 unit and consistently high demand, the system is frequently stocking out, indicating that the base stock level (governed by mu_hat and sigma_hat) needs to reflect this higher mean and volatility. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime of ~206 demand units/period which, when multiplied by (1+L)=5, results in a base stock target around 1030 units. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased variance seen in this new regime (standard deviation of ~23.5 vs the historical ~40 which was skewed by the regime shift).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of 206 units (range 183-244) over Periods 18-22 (+128% from original baseline).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift, stabilizing at a much higher level compared to the initial periods. Over the last 6 periods (P18-P23), demand has averaged 202.1 units (183, 244, 194, 203, 205, 162), with a peak of 244 in Period 21. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is experiencing frequent stockouts because historical orders (placed during lower-demand periods) are insufficient to meet current demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To ensure the OR backend properly captures this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6), which fully encompasses the high-demand stabilization. This will set a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) at this higher mean, helping to recover from the current stockout situation as larger orders arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~202 units per period (Periods 18-23), representing a sustained >120% increase from the initial baseline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand has averaged 196.3 units (203, 194, 244, 183, 184, 170), representing a significant and sustained increase from the initial baseline of ~90 units. The current on-hand inventory is 50 units, and the pipeline is substantial (834 units), largely due to the aggressive ordering in recent periods to catch up with the surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is high (q=0.8). I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (Avg ~200 units per period). This will ensure the base stock calculation (covering 5 periods of demand) remains responsive to the current volume while the pipeline catches up to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in high-volume state: Periods 19-24 average demand is 196.3 units, approximately 118% higher than the Period 1-10 baseline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 195.1 units, which is a significant increase from the initial baseline (~90). In the most recent 5 periods (P21-P25), the mean demand is 198.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 21 order exactly in Period 25. The current on-hand inventory is 48 units and the in-transit pipeline (ordered P22-P25) is 764 units. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80%, which the backend OR engine will calculate. I am using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the initial low-demand period. Setting L to default (4) as the lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume regime since Period 19. Over the last 8 periods (P19-P26), the mean demand is approximately 192 units. Although Period 26 saw a drop to 147 units, this follows a period of 221, and the overall volume remains significantly higher than the initial baseline (~90). Profit is $4.0 and Holding Cost is $1.0, implying a high service level is optimal (q = 0.8). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 151 and in-transit at 724 (total pipeline 875), and lead time L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods of demand), the logic 5 * 192 = 960 suggests we need to maintain a higher base stock to prevent stockouts seen in previous weeks. Using N=8 for 'recent_N' captures this stabilized high-demand regime while filtering out the initial low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high-volume state: Periods 19-26 average demand is ~192 units, approximately 113% higher than the Period 1-10 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $740.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume regime significantly above the initial baseline. Over the most recent 9 periods (P19-P27), the average demand is 194.3 units, compared to the ~90 units seen at the start. On-hand inventory is 168 and in-transit is 628, totaling 796 units of coverage. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At a mean of ~195, 5 periods require approx 975 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the current stable high-demand regime. Sigma_hat will also use N=9 to reflect the current volatility (std dev is approx 31 in this window). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $631.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a significantly higher level compared to the start of the game. For the last 10 periods (P19-P28), the mean demand is 193.3 units, compared to the original baseline of approximately 90 units. Recent demand observations (P24-P28) are [170, 221, 147, 227, 184], which shows continued high volatility (standard deviation ~34). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P24 order in P28. Current inventory position: On-hand (105) + In-transit (753) = 858. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 5 * 193.3 = 966.5. Since the pipeline (858) is currently below the projected 5-period demand (966.5), the backend needs to trigger replenishment. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable high-demand regime, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has been a stable 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime since Period 19, with the most recent average demand (Periods 25-29) being approximately 207 units and a peak of 239 units in Period 29. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is low (15 units) relative to recent demand, and there is a healthy pipeline of 779 units. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80%, meaning we prioritize meeting demand while managing stockout risk. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (starting around Period 19) while smoothing out recent volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volume regime since approximately Period 16-18. Looking at the last 10 periods (P21 to P30), the average demand is 203.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by the latest arrival (ordered P26, arrived P30). The current on-hand inventory is very low (9 units), but the in-transit pipeline is substantial (819 units), which represents orders from P27, P28, P29, and P30 (expected arrivals in P31, P32, P33, and P34). Given the profit/holding ratio, the backend base-stock calculation will target a high service level. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) provides a stable estimate of this high-demand regime, while L is set to calculated to reflect the 4-period reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 21-30 average demand is 203.5 units (Std Dev ~32), confirming the sustained >100% volume increase from the start of the simulation.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) being 201.2 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 31, where demand (211) exceeded available units (157). Although there are 912 units in-transit, these represent orders from Periods 28, 29, 30, and 31. The order from Period 28 (246 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 32. To maintain service levels and account for the high volatility (sigma around 32-35 in this regime), I will use the recent 10-period window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current state accurately. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling (1+L=5) periods of demand.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volume regime since approximately Period 21. For the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand is 200.7 units with a standard deviation of 33.1. The current on-hand inventory is 85 units, and a large shipment of 800 units is already in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volume and current in-transit levels, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable high-demand regime. This provides a base_stock target that accounts for 5 periods (L+1) of demand (~1000 units), which reconciles well with current inventory (85) and in-transit (800) levels to ensure high service levels without over-ordering beyond the backend cap.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent 10-period window (Periods 24-33), the average demand is 199.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival data (e.g., Period 29 order arrived in Period 33). On-hand inventory is currently 72 units with 779 units in-transit, which covers the upcoming demand cycles. I will use a recent_N approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=10 to capture this stable high-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the initial low-demand phase. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that balances the high service level requirements (high profit/holding ratio) against the holding costs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volume regime. Looking at the last 15 periods (P20-P34), demand averages 202.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 27.6. Recently (P31-P34), demand averages 196 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P34 of the P30 order. Current inventory metrics show On-hand at 97 and In-transit at 719. To optimize for the service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent window (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the entire stable high-demand regime without being skewed by the initial low-demand period (P1-P11). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering (L+1) periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a high-volume regime established around Period 20. Over the last 15 periods (P21-P35), the average demand is 205.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 123 units and in-transit is 715 units. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, I will use a 15-period lookback (recent_N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. This period's demand (215) and others are very close to the 205 average, suggesting consistent demand behavior. This parameter setting helps the OR backend determine if the current pipeline (715) + on-hand (123) is sufficient to cover the (L+1)=5 period lead time demand, which is approximately 1025 units. Since 838 < 1025, the OR backend will likely trigger an replenishment order.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volume regime since approximately Period 21. Analyzing the last 15 periods (P22-P36), the mean demand is approximately 204.6 units with a standard deviation of 30.2 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as reinforced by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently low (9 units), and we have 804 units in the pipeline (orders from P33-P36). To maintain a high service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) while accounting for the current demand volatility, I will use a recent window (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the stabilized high-demand regime without being diluted by the early low-demand periods. The backend OR engine will use these parameters to determine the base stock sufficient for the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P22-P36): Mean ~205 units, Std Dev ~30 units (sustained >100% increase from baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we observed a massive demand spike of 369 units, far exceeding the previous high-demand regime average of ~205 units. This suggests a potential new demand regime or a significant outlier/seasonal peak. The 'chips' category often experiences sharp spikes around events. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 33 order. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To capture this new upward volatility and avoid stockouts while respecting the OR backend's inventory balancing, I will shift the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 calculation to specifically target the most recent behavior (the last 10 periods, which captures the lead-time window and the recent peak). I'm choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent volatility and the 369-unit peak heavily while maintaining some stability.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand surge detected at Period 37: 369 units (80% above previous regime mean). Monitoring for sustained increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $760.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, a major demand spike occurred (369 units), significantly higher than the previous stabilized mean of ~205. While Period 38 demand returned towards the previous mean (214 units), the system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory and heavy reliance on the 1029 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the potential for a new high-demand regime or seasonal peak (often seen late in cycles), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to aggressively capture the recent volatility and the spike. This averages (~369+214+248)/3 = 277 units per period. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well (N=3) to account for this increased variance, which will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock to protect against further spikes while we wait for the large pipeline to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Recent demand volatility observed (P37 demand: 369) suggests a potential transition to a higher-volume regime or seasonal peak; monitoring if demand sustains above the previous 205-unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $948.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are managing a significant demand surge that began in Period 37 (369 units) and has continued through Period 39 (271 units). The previous mean of ~205 is no longer sufficient. Over the last 3 periods (P37-P39), average demand is 284.7 units, a 39% increase over the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 1204 units (ordered P36-P39). I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the immediate impact of this new high-volume surge/volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for roughly 285 units per period across the lead time plus review period (1+4=5 periods). This captures the recent trend while acknowledging the high variance (369 vs 214 vs 271).

Carry-over insight: New demand surge regime confirmed at Period 40: Average demand for P37-P39 is 284.7 units (+39% from the previous 205-unit regime), with a peak of 369 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $637.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand surge regime that began around Period 37. While the demand in Period 40 was lower (172 units), the average for the P37-P40 period is approximately 256.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous baseline of ~205 units. Despite this recent lower data point, the volatility remains high (as seen in Period 37's 369 units). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With only 51 units on hand and 1348 units in transit, we must maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts during this volatile period. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated average (approx 256.5 per period, totaling 1282.5 over L+1) and sigma_hat to account for the increased standard deviation (approx 83.5 per period, resulting in 186.7 over sqrt(L+1)). This ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for high profit-to-holding-cost ratios while reacting to the most recent regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $519.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a highly volatile and elevated regime starting around Period 37. While the previous regime (P22-P36) averaged ~205 units, the last 5 periods (P37-P41) have averaged ~238 units (369, 214, 271, 172, 164) with significant variance. Although the last two periods show a dip, the peak in P37 and the carry-over insights suggest we are in a higher-volume phase. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this latest volatility and the higher mean, ensuring our base stock covers the current (L+1) demand window. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history. The 'sigma_hat' is set via 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the recent spike in volatility (Std Dev > 80 in this window due to the 369 outlier), which helps the OR backend maintain a higher safety stock to prevent stockouts during this unpredictable surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated and volatile (P37-P41 mean: 238 units), though softening in the most recent two periods (P40-P41).

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant surge starting at Period 37, peaking at 369 units. While demand in the last three periods (P40-P42) has moderated (172, 164, 175 respectively), it remains volatile. The average demand for the 'surge regime' (P37-P42) is approximately 227.5 units, which is higher than the previous 205-unit baseline but lower than the initial surge peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 281 and a large pipeline of 894 units (reflecting aggressive orders from P39-P40 finally arriving), we are well-covered. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated and volatile state (P37-P42), ensuring the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and increased standard deviation observed during this recent period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surged significantly between Period 37 and 39 (peaking at 369), but has recently moderated and stabilized over the last four periods (P40: 172, P41: 164, P42: 175, P43: 167), averaging approximately 170 units. This is lower than the previous high-sustained regime of ~205 units. My on-hand inventory is currently high (526) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the peak surge (P38 and P39). With an in-transit pipeline of 595 units, I am well-stocked to cover the current demand. I am setting L to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=7 to capture the surge and the recent moderation (spanning P37 to P43), which balances the need for protection against volatility while acknowledging the recent softening in demand to prevent excessive overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand moderated after Period 37-39 surge: Average demand for P40-P43 is ~170 units, a decrease from the previous ~205 unit baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand surge (P37-P39) has completely subsided. Demand over the last five periods (P40-P44) has averaged 183.8 units (172, 164, 175, 167, 241), effectively returning to the pre-surge baseline of ~200 units. My previous aggressive ordering (orders from P38, P39, P40) has resulted in a high on-hand inventory of 652 units, which is already sufficient to cover over 3 periods of current demand. Total pipeline inventory (346 units from P41-P44) plus on-hand inventory (652 units) equals 998 units. Given an average demand of ~185 units and a (L+1) window of 5 periods, the target base stock is approximately 5 * 185 = 925 units. Since 998 > 925, I need to allow the inventory to bleed down to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat to reflect the post-surge moderation using the last 5 periods (N=5) and stick with the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge (P37-P39) has concluded; demand returned to ~185 unit average over P40-P44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The simulation is entering its final stages (Period 46/50). Current on-hand inventory is 502 units with 302 units in-transit, totaling 804 units. Given the lead time is 4 periods and the simulation ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 46) would arrive at the start of Period 51 (Period 50 conclude), making it unusable for satisfying demand within the game's timeframe. Recent demand from Period 40 to 45 (172, 164, 175, 167, 241, 194) averages approximately 186 units per period. With only 5 periods of demand remaining (P46-P50), the total expected demand is roughly 930 units (5 * 186). Since we have 804 units already available or arriving before the game ends (P42, P43, P44, P45 orders), and the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0) makes overstocking near the end very costly, I am setting parameters to prevent further ordering. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 captures the current moderated demand regime (~186/period) while the backend calculation for base stock will recognize the high pipeline inventory and minimize additional orders.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chip category has returned to a stable, mid-high demand regime following a significant surge (Period 37-39). Over the last 7 periods (P40-P46), the mean demand is 179.7 units with a standard deviation of 36.3. The current on-hand inventory (424) and in-transit units (410, primarily from P43 and P44 orders) provide a substantial buffer. Since we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50) and current pipeline inventory (834 total) covers roughly 4.6 periods of current mean demand, I will focus on maintaining a lean position to minimize holding costs while ensuring service levels for the remaining 4 periods. I'm using N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-surge stability accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $533.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand surge observed in Periods 37-39 has concluded. Over the last 8 periods (P40-P47), demand has stabilized at a mean of 184.5 units, which is slightly lower than the pre-surge baseline of ~205. The system currently has a high level of on-hand inventory (323 units) and significant in-transit stock (421 units) totaling 744 units. At the current demand rate, this covers approximately 4 periods of demand, which aligns with the total review + lead time (1+4=5). Since we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50), the priority is to avoid accumulating excess inventory that will incur holding costs without being sold. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the last 8 periods to reflect the stabilized post-surge demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Post-surge demand stabilization confirmed: Period 40-47 mean demand is 184.5 units, reflecting a return to lower volume following the Period 37-39 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $599.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized after the surge observed in Periods 37-39. Since Period 40, the average demand has been approximately 185.5 units (P40-P48), which is significantly lower than the ~285 units seen during the peak but consistent with a post-surge normalization. Current on-hand inventory is 233 units, and there are 538 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only two periods remaining in the simulation (P49 and P50), and a lead time of 4, any order placed now will not arrive before the simulation ends. Therefore, the parameter settings should focus on accurately reflecting the most recent demand regime (P40-P48) to manage the pipeline and service level for the final periods. I am using recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized post-surge demand mean (~185) and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $767.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the demand has stabilized following the significant surge observed during Periods 37-39. Since that surge, demand has settled into a regime with a mean of approximately 188.4 units per period (calculated from Periods 40-49). The current on-hand inventory is 33 units, with a very large in-transit pipeline of 758 units. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need enough inventory (on-hand + in-transit) to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent mean of 188.4, the required base stock is roughly 942 units. Our current pipeline inventory (on-hand 33 + in-transit 758 = 791) is below this level. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this post-surge stabilization regime (Periods 40-49). Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals.
