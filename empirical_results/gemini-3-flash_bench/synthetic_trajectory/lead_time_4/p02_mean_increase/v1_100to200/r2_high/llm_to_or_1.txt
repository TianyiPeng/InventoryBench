Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. I am observing the system for the first time. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profitability-to-holding-cost ratio that suggests a high service level (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95). The promised lead time is 4. I have 5 historical demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) for this SKU. The mean of these samples is 101.8 and the standard deviation is 28.5. Given we are at the start and have no lead time observations yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean (101.8 * (1+4) = 509) and volatility (28.5 * sqrt(5) = 63.7) based on the provided sample set. This ensures a stock level that covers the 5-period risk horizon (1 review + 4 lead).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 149 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), and they remain in-transit. On-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 since demand was 126. The historical demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) and Period 1 demand (126) suggest a mean demand of approximately 106 per period. Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (1+4)=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the recent trend including Period 1, while relying on the OR backend's service level logic (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95) to manage the stock-out risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning orders from Period 1 and 2 won't arrive until Period 5 and 6 respectively. Demand has been relatively stable but lower than the historical samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) provided. Specifically, observed demand in P1 (126) and P2 (83) averages 104.5. Including the historical seed data, the average demand is approximately 102.6. Using the promised lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the localized downward trend compared to the initial historical samples, choosing N=7 to encompass both the 5 historical samples and the 2 observed periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 433 units (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Historical demand for the first three periods was 126, 83, and 70. However, the full sample set provided in the instructions shows periods 1-5 with values 141, 118, 67, 94, 89 (note: there is a slight discrepancy between concluding messages and the provided sample list; I will prioritize the provided 5-period sample data for forecasting). The mean demand over 5 periods is 101.8. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1=5 periods. My target base stock should be approximately 5 * 102 = 510. Since 433 units are already in transit and on-hand is 0, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order. I will use 'default' for L as no arrivals have occurred to suggest a drift yet. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the early baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (totaling 149, 138, 146, and 106 units respectively). According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (Period N+L = 1+4=5). It will not be visible until the Period 6 decision phase. Consequently, current on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have been 0 despite existing demand, because no shipments have arrived yet. Demand over the first 5 periods has been fluctuating (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) with a mean of approximately 101.8. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4 and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the initial demand distribution, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~509 units). Our current in-transit (539) already covers this, so the OR backend will likely moderate order quantities until arrivals begin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2031.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The 'Period 5 conclude' message confirms that the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4), matching the promise. Initial demand samples (Periods 1-5) are: 141, 118, 67, 94, 89 (mean: 101.8, std: 27.6). Note that 'conclude' demand reflects actual sales/demand during the period whereas 'Historical Demand' provides initial context. Current on-hand is 40. In-transit consists of orders from P2 (138), P3 (146), P4 (106), and P5 (14), totaling 404 units. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4, the P2 order is expected during P6 (visible P7), P3 during P7, etc. The OR backend uses (1+L) periods for base stock. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand characteristics while we await more lead-time data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1282.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Reviewing history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). This means we have a 4-period lead time, and our base stock should cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Historical demand (P1 to P6) averages approximately 94.3 units (126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73). Current on-hand is 105, and in-transit is 397 (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Total pipeline + on-hand = 502 units. Based on an average demand of ~95, 5 periods of demand is ~475 units. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full observed demand history while allowing the OR engine to calculate the service level based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (~19:1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1089.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed for the first three orders (P1 arriving P5, P2 arriving P6, P3 arriving P7). Demand remains relatively stable with no clear seasonal spikes yet, averaging approximately 90.4 units per period across all 7 historical samples (126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67). I will use L=4 (promised/observed). For mu_hat, considering (1+L) periods of demand, I'll use all 7 samples (N=7) as the regime appears stable. The on-hand inventory is currently high (184) because P3's order just arrived, but the backend's capped base-stock policy will account for current inventory and in-transit units (304) to avoid over-ordering. sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the recent stable demand history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2850.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Looking at the conclude messages, orders from Period 1 through 4 have all arrived with a consistent lead time of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history shows some volatility (ranging from 67 to 157 in recent periods). The last period (Period 8) saw a significant jump in demand to 157, whereas previous periods were lower. On-hand inventory is 133, and in-transit inventory is 247 (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). Since the lead time L=4 is stable, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the average and variance of the full demand history observed so far, which balances the recent spike with the earlier lower values while ensuring (1+L) coverage.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (P5 through P9) consistently confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 40 units, and there are 384 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). Historical demand samples (P1-P9) show a mean of approximately 99.7 units per period. Recently, Period 8 saw a spike (157), but Period 9 returned to 107. Since there are no specific calendar dates or product descriptions suggesting a seasonal shift, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the full observed history of demand. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as the observed data (L=4) perfectly matches the promised value. This configuration balances the risk of stockouts during the 4-period lead time against the holding cost of the 'Regular' chips category.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Analysis of the concluding messages from Periods 5 to 10 confirms that the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 98.7 units per period across 10 periods, with no significant structural shifts detected yet (values ranging from 67 to 157). My current on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 402. For the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'calculate' as it accurately captures the observed 4-period lead time. 2) mu_hat is set to 'default' to use the full history of samples (10 samples) which provides a stable mean of ~99, reflecting a base stock requirement for L+1 (5 periods) of ~495 units. 3) sigma_hat is set to 'default' because the current sample size is small, and the default standard deviation calculation provides a safe buffer for the 95% service level desired given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data from Period 5 through Period 11 consistently confirms an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. Since the lead time is stable, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. On the demand side, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability. From P1-P11, the demand samples are: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67, 157, 107, 90, 94. The mean of these 11 samples is approximately 98.27. I am choosing N=11 (the full observed history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline variance and mean, as there are no strong signals of a regime shift or seasonality at this stage. This provides a stable estimate for the OR engine to calculate the base stock across the 5-period risk window (L+1). Current on-hand is 40 and in-transit is 466, which covers the pipeline adequately, so no emergency adjustments are needed.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), while the in-transit pipeline is substantial (501 units). Historical lead times have consistently been 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand over the last 12 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 97 units per period. The backend OR logic uses (1+L) as the horizon. With L=4, the horizon is 5 periods. The mean demand for these 5 periods is approximately 485 units. Since we have 501 units in transit and 5 on hand (Total 506), the 'base stock - pipeline' logic will likely result in small or zero orders if we use default parameters. However, to ensure we maintain a high service level given the low on-hand stock, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full observed history's variance and mean accurately. No significant regime shift is detected, so N=12 is appropriate to smooth out noise.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe a steady lead time of 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-13). Total demand history consists of 18 samples (5 provided in context + 13 from game history). The mean demand is approximately 97 units per period. The recent demand (last 3 periods) shows a slight drop (94, 84, 44), but the overall volatility remains moderate. Given the profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1), the target cycle service level q = 19/20 = 95%. I will set L to the default promised lead time (4) as it is consistent with observed data. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture the full game history demand behavior while excluding the initial arbitrary seed samples if they differ from realized demand, ensuring a stable baseline for the (1+L) coverage requirement.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the first 14 periods is approximately 99 units. Recent demand has fluctuated, with a high of 145 in P14 and a low of 44 in P13. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since P9, demand has been slightly more volatile than in the initial periods. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering Periods 9-14) to better capture recent demand variability and mean shifts. The lead time L is stable at the promised value of 4, so I will use the default method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2867.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 78 units on-hand and 342 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every arrival since Period 5 (orders from P1 through P11). Demand has exhibited significant volatility in recent periods: 44 (P13), 145 (P14), and 155 (P15). The mean demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 99.8 units, while the last 5 periods (P11-P15) average 104.4. Given the high stockout risk seen in Period 12 and the recent upswing in demand, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=10) to capture the higher volatility seen in the middle/late history (std dev ~35.5) while anchoring the mean to a broader 10-period window to smooth out the P13 dip. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the 5 periods (L+1) until the next possible replenishment arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3078.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we experienced a stockout (demand 185 vs 162 available), ending with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have a stockout and demand appears to be trending upwards in the last three periods (145, 155, 185), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture this shift. The mean of the last 5 demand samples (Periods 12-16) is 142.6. With L=4 (total 5 periods of coverage), mu_hat should target approximately 713 units. The OR backend will calculate this using recent_N=5. Current in-transit is 424 (from orders in Periods 13, 14, 15, 16), and on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory is 424. The target base stock should be significantly higher than 424 to satisfy the 95% service level (~Profit/(Profit+Holding) = 19/20 = 0.95), especially given the recent high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand has increased significantly over the last 3 periods (avg 161.7 vs previous historical avg 100), leading to a stockout in Period 16.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. A clear demand regime shift was detected starting in Period 15, with demand values of 155, 185, and 162 (avg ~167), significantly higher than the previous average of ~100. This shift caused stockouts in Period 16 and 17. The current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 566 units, which includes orders from Period 14 (35 units), Period 15 (148 units), Period 16 (166 units), and Period 17 (217 units). The order from Period 14 (35 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 18. To capture the recent high demand while maintaining stability, I am using recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to calculate the parameters for the current (L+1)=5 period window. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand regime (approx 5 * 167 = 835) and volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 15/16. Demand for the last 4 periods (P15 to P18) has been 155, 185, 162, and 205, averaging 176.75 units per period. This is a significant increase from the earlier historical average of ~100. Due to this shift and the 4-period lead time, we have experienced stockouts in Periods 16, 17, and 18 because earlier orders were based on the lower demand average. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am setting L to 'default' (4) and using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new elevated demand regime (average ~177) and its volatility, ensuring the base stock level is high enough to cover the lead time plus the review period (5 days total) at the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: avg increased from ~100 to ~177 (+77%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 20. The current date is Period_20. Historical data and recent demand trends (Periods 15-19) show a significant demand regime shift. The average demand from Period 1 to 14 was approximately 100 units, but from Period 15 to 19, the demand increased to an average of 182 units (155, 185, 162, 205, 203). This shift has resulted in four consecutive periods of stockouts (Periods 16-19) because the inventory arriving (ordered 4 periods prior during the lower demand regime) was insufficient to meet the new, higher demand level. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). To address this, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 15-19). L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time. This will raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand and recover from the stockout situation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 15. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P15-P20) is approximately 184 units, significantly higher than the initial average of ~100. We have experienced stockouts from Period 16 through Period 20 because the arriving shipments (orders from P12-P16) were based on the old, lower demand regime. As of Period 21, the on-hand inventory is 0. The arriving stock in P21 will be the order from P17 (217 units). Given the recent demand average of ~184, we expect this 217 to cover Period 21 but leave very little for subsequent periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use N=6 for mu_hat to capture this recent high-demand regime (avg ~184) and N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this period. Setting L to calculate ensures we stick to the observed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4123.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Periods 1-14, demand averaged approximately 93 units. Since Period 15, demand has surged, averaging approximately 193 units over the last 7 periods (P15-P21: 155, 185, 162, 205, 203, 194, 244). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system has been stocking out since Period 16 despite consistent arrivals, because the pipeline order quantities from Periods 12-14 (84, 75, 35) were insufficient for the new demand level. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. To address the new demand level and recover from the stockout cycle, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 samples (recent_N=7) to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~193 * (1+4) = 965). sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=7 to reflect the increased volatility in this new period. This should trigger larger orders to satisfy the service level requirement (profit $19 vs holding cost $1) and replenish the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~193 units/period starting Period 15 (previously ~93). Stockout cycle continues due to low historical pipeline orders (P12-P14).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to ~200. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), the mean demand is 205.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.3. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The inventory is currently recovering from a long stockout caused by low pipeline orders from P12-P14. The arrival in P22 (194 units) finally met demand (183 units), leaving a small surplus (11). I am using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the pre-shift data. With L=4, the base stock will cover (L+1=5) periods of demand, roughly 1030 units. Subtracting the high in-transit (829) and on-hand (11) will results in an order that maintains this coverage as the higher volume pipeline orders (P19-P22) begin to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 now fully stabilized at ~206 avg (last 5 periods: 205.8). Leading to consistent stockouts until Period 22 when larger previous orders began arriving.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to an average of ~206. In the last 5 periods (P19-P23), the actual demand values were 203, 194, 244, 183, and 184 (average 201.6). Although historical averages were heavily suppressed by stockouts, the last two periods where inventory was available show demand tapering slightly but remaining high. To reflect this new stabilized high-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=9, covering the period from the clear shift in P15 to P23) for demand forecasting. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as seen in the arrival history (latest arrival in P23 was ordered in P19). The pipeline inventory is very high (833) because of large orders placed during the stockout phase (P20-P23: 203, 169, 242, 219), which should soon cover the demand and potentially lead to high ending inventory if not managed. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 captures this higher mean demand while setting L=4 correctly accounts for the lead time and the current high pipeline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from a historical average of approximately 100 units to a new sustained level around 205 units. Recent demand (Periods 20\u201324) shows levels of 194, 244, 183, 184, and 170. The average demand across these last 5 periods is 195 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the shift is now well-established and has stabilized at this higher level, I'm setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this regime while smoothing out the volatility observed in Period 21. Standard deviation is also calculated using the last 10 samples to reflect the higher variability (sigma) associated with the increased demand volume. Pipeline inventory (804 units) is currently robust as previous high-volume orders placed during the stockout period (Periods 17-21) are beginning to arrive.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 15. The historical mean of the last 11 samples (Period 15-25) is 191.4 units per period. The recent demand fluctuations (ranging from 170 to 244) suggest maintaining a recent window for forecasting. The lead time is consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 23 and a large pipeline (in-transit: 793), the current strategy is to maintain the service level while accounting for the increased demand. I will use the last 11 samples (Period 15-25) as the basis for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current high-demand regime (+91% over the initial baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2675.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to a significantly higher level. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is approximately 191.3. The most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) show a similar mean of 181.0, though Period 21 had a spike of 244. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 118, and pipeline inventory is healthy at 786 units. To maintain appropriate stock levels given the higher demand regime and the 4-period lead time (requiring coverage for 5 periods) while accounting for the high service level indicated by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (q \u2248 0.95), I will use the last 12 periods (covering the entire high-demand regime) to calculate the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This ensures the OR engine captures the recent volatility and increased average volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed and sustained through Period 26: mean increased from ~100 to ~190 (+90%).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 15, moving from a historical average of approximately 100 to a new average of approximately 190. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 170, 221, 147, 227, 244) confirms this higher level, with a mean of 201.8. Inventory has stabilized since larger orders (placed post-Period 17) started arriving in Period 22. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N=13 to capture the entire high-demand regime since Period 15, setting L=4 to match observations. This allows the OR backend to calculate base stock levels based on the current higher-demand environment while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~190. Recent demand samples (Periods 19-28) show a stable but high mean of 194.3 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 22, the supply chain has stabilized, and stockouts have been avoided as higher-volume orders placed during the regime shift began arriving. I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high-demand mean and variance, which better reflects the current environment than the total historical average. This will set a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5), maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to ~195 units per period. The last 14 periods (P16-P29) show a mean demand of 195.4 with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. We are currently in a period of high demand, and on-hand inventory is low (19 units) following a high demand period (239). The pipeline inventory (827) is healthy, reflecting the larger orders placed recently. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture this new regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the pre-shift data. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the elevated demand across the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to approximately 190-200 units per period. Over the last 15 periods (since P16), the average demand is 196.2, and for the last 5 periods (P26-P30), it is 202.6. Given this sustained higher demand level, I am using recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while filtering out the lower pre-shift data. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrival of the P26 order in Period 30. The In-transit inventory is high (833), which covers roughly 4 periods of demand, but the current On-hand is low (38), so maintaining a consistent base stock via the recent_N parameters is necessary to avoid future stockouts as older, smaller orders finish cycling through.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high regime since Period 15, with an average demand of approximately 199.5 units over the last 17 periods (P15-P31). Period 31 ended in a stockout (on-hand: 0) as the arrival from Period 27 (138 units) was insufficient to meet the demand of 211. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level is high (~95%). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (recent_N=17) to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility, while keeping L at the promised 4 periods since it remains stable.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that occurred around Period 15 has sustained a higher level. Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand is approximately 194.4 units, compared to the earlier historical average of ~100. Despite a stockout in Period 31, inventory is recovering with an arrival of 239 units in Period 32. The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P28 order arrived in P32). I will continue to use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=18 to cover the period since the shift began (around Period 15), ensuring the OR backend captures the higher stable demand while filtering out the noise of the initial transition.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3467.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 15. Over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), the average demand is 196.7 units, which is consistent with the previously identified shift from ~100 to ~190+. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Recent inventory levels have fluctuated due to shifts in demand/supply timing, with a stockout in Period 31. To maintain a high service level (optimal q \u2248 0.95 given profit $19 vs holding $1), I am using a recent window (N=10) to capture the current demand mean and volatility while setting the lead time L to the proven 4 periods. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the active regime without being skewed by the lower demand seen in early periods (P1-P14).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P24-P33): mean is ~197 units per period. Standard lead time remains 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4154.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to approximately 197 units per period. The last 10 periods (P25-P34) show a mean demand of 191.9 with a standard deviation of 31.9. In Period 34, the ending on-hand inventory was 121 and in-transit units totaled 750 (representing orders from Periods 31, 32, 33, and 34). The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is very high (95%), requiring a robust base stock that covers L+1 (5) periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stabilized demand regime (P25-P34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, and 'calculate' for the lead time as it remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to ~200 units per period. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 24-35), the mean demand is approximately 201.25 units with a standard deviation of 26.6. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. The current on-hand inventory is 127, with a healthy pipeline (in-transit) of 780 units. To maintain the high service level required by the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95), I am using 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility based on the last 12 periods to capture the current stabilized regime accurately. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5 periods of demand) while accounting for current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P24-P35): mean is 201 units per period, standard deviation is 26.6. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 15, with the most recent sustained pattern (P24-P36) showing a mean of approximately 205 units per period. The standard lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 48 units with 815 units in-transit. To maintain a sufficient base stock level for the current regime and avoid stockouts (as seen in P31), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (N=13, covering P24-P36) to capture the stabilized high-demand mean and variance accurately. This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant demand profile to calculate the order quantity while balancing holding costs against the $19/unit profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3800.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, there was a massive demand spike to 369 units, causing a stockout. This is nearly double the average of the previous stable regime (~200). Looking at the date sequence, it is possible this represents a seasonal peak or a new step-change. The 'In-transit' inventory of 919 reflects orders placed in P34, P35, P36, and P37 which have not arrived yet. Since lead time is stable at 4 periods, I expect P34's order (208 units) to arrive in Period 38, P35's (251) in P39, etc. To protect against this new higher demand level, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use a more recent window (N=14) to capture the uptrend and increasing sigma_hat using an explicit value of 45 (compared to the previous ~26) to account for the increased volatility seen in the P37 spike. L is kept at 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 4 units.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand surge/regime shift starting Period 37: demand spiked to 369 (+85% vs previous regime avg).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant spike in Period 37 (369 units), indicating a potential new demand regime or a seasonal surge. While Period 38 saw a return to 214, the stockout in both periods suggests that the current inventory levels and pipeline are insufficient for these higher peaks. I will adjust mu_hat to reflect this higher variability and potential sustained increase. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 (covering periods 34-38) to better capture this recent volatility while not overreacting to a single outlier. L remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased standard deviation caused by the Period 37 spike, ensuring a higher service level to mitigate stockout risks.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand volatility increase starting Period 37: Period 37 demand was 369 units (+85% vs previous regime avg). Sustained monitoring required to see if this is a one-time event or a new high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4769.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are managing a second major demand regime shift. After the relatively stable Period 24-36 regime (avg ~201), demand spiked to 369 in Period 37 and remained high at 271 in Period 39 (stockout occurred in P37, P38, P39). This suggests a new, higher mean and significantly increased volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this new higher demand level (averaging ~285 per period in this 3-period window) and account for the spike. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers both the projected demand increase and the higher safety stock required by the increased variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 37: 3-period mean increased from ~201 to ~285 (+42%). High volatility observed (range 214-369).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3236.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 37. The last 4 periods of demand are 369, 214, 271, and 172. While the most recent demand (172) was lower, the overall mean for this segment (P37-P40) is approximately 256.5 units/period, which is a 27% increase over the previous regime (avg ~201). This shift was likely driven by a seasonal or calendar-based surge for chips. On-hand inventory is low (32 units) and we have experienced several stockouts recently due to this sudden surge. The pipeline is healthy (1267 units), but the OR backend needs to recognize the elevated demand. I am setting L to 4 as confirmed by historical arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new volatility and higher mean while allowing for the significant fluctuation observed (172 to 369). This will ensure the base stock levels are high enough to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the current period's demand occurring after our decision.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift (P37-P40) mean is ~256.5 (+27% vs previous regime) with significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~84 vs ~27).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2992.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second regime shift starting at Period 37. The last five periods of demand (P37-P41) are 369, 214, 271, 172, and 164. While the mean of these five periods is approximately 238, there is significant volatility (StdDev approx 84) and a recent downward trend (172, 164). However, the initial spike to 369 suggests high peak potential. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the backend's base-stock logic will naturally target a high service level. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime while acknowledging the recent lower demand levels. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P37 order arrived P41). Pipeline inventory is high (1309 units), which will moderate the final order to avoid excessive overstock while protecting against the observed demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift (starting P37) shows high volatility; mean (P37-P41) is ~238 with a standard deviation of ~84.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3142.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility since Period 37. While an initial surge peaked at 369, the last three periods have settled at 172, 164, and 175, suggesting the 'second regime shift' noted in previous periods might be stabilizing at a lower mean than initially feared, or exhibiting high variance. Given the current on-hand inventory of 183 and a very large pipeline of 1144 units (following aggressive ordering in Periods 39-41), we must avoid excessive overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the post-Period 37 average (approx 227.5) and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (StdDev approx 80). This provides a balanced base stock to cover demand until the large pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 37-42: Mean \u2248 227.5, but last 3 periods (40-42) show a localized mean of 170.3, indicating either high volatility or a return to the Period 24-35 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2794.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing a high inventory level (on-hand 379) following a significant delivery of 363 units from Period 39. Demand analysis shows a two-regime transition: Period 24-36 averaged ~201 units, while Period 37-43 averaged ~219 units. However, the last four periods (40-43) show a marked decline with a localized mean of 169.5 (172, 164, 175, 167), suggesting the high-demand burst from Periods 37-39 (369, 214, 271) has subsided or stabilized back toward previous levels. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this transition (mean ~219), while increasing sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in the preceding few periods (StdDev is ~70). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat this way allows the OR backend to maintain a safe service level while acknowledging the recent dip in demand to avoid excessive overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (P50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 37-43: High-demand burst (P37-39 avg ~285) has settled into a lower, stable range (P40-43 avg ~169.5). Overall Period 37-43 mean is ~219 with high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4027.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand behavior (Period 37-44) shows a high-demand spike followed by a stabilization at a higher mean than the P24-P35 era. Specifically, demand from Period 40-44 has averaged 189.8 units, while the entire P37-44 regime averages 221.6. Period 44 demand (241) confirms we are not fully returning to the old ~200 baseline but rather staying in a more volatile environment. I am using recent_N=8 to capture this entire second regime (P37-P44) to set the mean and variance. This ensures mu_hat is based on the elevated average (~222 * 5 = 1110) while capturing the recent volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand is currently high (552) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the high-spike phase (P39-P40), which will now buffer against any further spikes while the OR backend throttles new orders via the cap.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime (starting P37) has settled; mean (P37-P44) is approx 222 units with increased volatility compared to the previous stable period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3030.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 37 has exhibited significant variability. While it initially spiked (avg ~285 in P37-39), the last 6 periods (P40-45) have averaged approximately 185.5 units, which is closer to the previous stable regime (avg ~200). The current on-hand inventory (656) and in-transit units (521) are very high due to aggressive ordering during the peak of the recent surge. We are currently overstocked relative to the recent demand mean. To prevent excessive holding costs while the backend policy (which will naturally reduce orders due to the high pipeline) adjusts, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=9 (covering the entire P37-45 regime) to capture the higher volatility (sigma) and the mean shift without overreacting to the very recent dip. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2255.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The most recent shift (starting Period 37) was characterized by a high-demand burst followed by a more moderate but highly volatile state. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is approximately 211.8 units/period. However, the last 4 periods (P43-P46) show a lower mean of 187.75, suggesting the 'spike' has fully subsided into a regime similar to the P24-P35 period (~201 units). Given the high on-hand inventory (576 units) and in-transit (616 units), we are currently overstocked due to large orders placed during the P37-P41 surge arriving now. To prevent further excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost implies a 95% service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current mean (approx 211) and updated volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P37 has settled: P37-P46 mean is ~212 units. High inventory accumulation (OH+IT > 1100 units) due to delayed reaction to the P37-P40 demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3599.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a second stable regime after a spike between Periods 37-39. From Period 40 to 47, the mean demand is approximately 184.5 units, significantly lower than the spike avg of 284.7 but slightly lower than the previous regime (P24-P35) of 201 units. Currently, there is an inventory surplus (On-hand: 467, In-transit: 624, total 1091) which is roughly 5.9 periods of demand based on the recent mean. This surplus stems from the high 'explicit' orders placed during the volatility of P39-P41. To minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the shift from P37 to present) to capture the current mean and volatility. The OR backend will naturally reduce orders as the pipeline is full. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3582.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has transitioned from a high-volatility spike (P37-P39) into a more stable regime. Over the last 9 periods (P40-P48), the average demand is approximately 195 units per period, which is very close to the previous stable regime (P24-P35) of ~200. Inventory levels are currently very high (On-hand: 370, In-transit: 716) due to aggressive ordering during the P37-P40 spike. Total inventory (1086) covers over 5.5 periods of the current average demand (~195). Given the 4-period lead time, we are oversupplied. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this stabilization and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to account for the current volatility (std dev \u2248 27). This will allow the OR backend to scale back orders while maintaining a safe buffer, gradually reducing the holding cost burden.

Carry-over insight: Demand has returned to a stable regime (P40-P48) with a mean of ~195 units, following the P37-P39 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3394.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent regime following a significant spike in Periods 37-39. Since Period 40, the average demand has been approximately 196 units per period (P40-P49 mean = 195.8, StdDev = 27.5), which is very close to the previous stable regime seen in Periods 24-35 (mean ~200). Current inventory levels are extremely high: On-hand inventory is 406 units and Pipeline inventory is 480 units, totaling 886 units. With a lead time of 4, the target pipeline (including the current period) should cover 5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~196, a 5-period requirement is approximately 980 units. Since 886 is close to this target and the engine's capped policy will naturally limit ordering when inventory surplus is detected, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable regime (P40-P49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time L is confirmed and stable at 4 periods.
