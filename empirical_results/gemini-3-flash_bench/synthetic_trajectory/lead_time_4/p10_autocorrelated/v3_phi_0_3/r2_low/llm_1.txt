To manage inventory effectively, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Historical demand data provided for Period 1-5 shows: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177. Total demand for the first 5 periods is 590 units. Averaging this gives approximately 118 units per period. Since I start with 0 stock and have a long lead time, I must order immediately to cover the expected cumulative demand for the periods until the first shipment arrives. I will target a slightly higher amount than the average to account for the increasing trend seen in Period 5 (177).",

My target inventory level is roughly (Avg Demand 120 * 5) + Safety Stock, totaling ~750-800 units. I have 600 in the pipeline.
