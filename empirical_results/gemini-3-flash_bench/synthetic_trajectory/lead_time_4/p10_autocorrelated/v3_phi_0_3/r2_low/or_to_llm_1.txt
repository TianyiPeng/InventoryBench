The historical demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggest a mean of approximately 118 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, meaning we must cover the demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 118 * 5 = 590 units. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. The OR algorithm recommends an order of 180 units. This recommendation is likely capped by the safety stock formula to prevent excessive holding costs in a single shipment. However, since we start at 0 inventory and it takes 4 periods for an order to arrive, we will definitely face stockouts for the next 4 periods. The OR recommendation of 180 is very conservative compared to the expected demand across the lead time window. I will follow the OR recommendation as a baseline for this first period to establish a steady flow, but I anticipate needing to order significant amounts in subsequent periods to build up the 'pipeline' to meet the ~118 units/period demand once arrivals begin.",

Strategy: The OR recommendation of 54 units brings total pipeline + current order to 572 units, which covers the expected demand for the lead time duration plus a small safety buffer.

The OR recommendation is 0 because the base_stock calculation (using all historical data) likely considers the 554 units in the pipeline sufficient to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). 4. Strategy: While the pipeline is large, we are currently stocking out. The P16 order (146 units) is expected to arrive in Period 20 (resolving after this decision), which should resolve the immediate stockout. Given the recent demand surge and the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (critical fractile 0.5), we should maintain a lean but safe pipeline. Since the current pipeline (554) covers about 5 periods of the new demand regime (5*112.5 = 562.5), the OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically sound to avoid excessive holding costs, but a small buffer is prudent given recent volatility and the risk of lost shipments.",

Period 24 order (150 units) is expected to arrive in Period 28. Demand Analysis: The current demand regime (since Period 16) is averaging approximately 128 units per period, significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (~78 units). Recent demand has fluctuated (147, 120, 89) but remains elevated compared to early stages. Inventory Position: On-hand is 94. In-transit is 377.

Total pipeline (including this period's expected arrival) + on-hand = 471 units. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests 72 units. The OR base-stock level (assuming L=4) aims to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current regime (128 units/period), the target inventory should be ~640 units plus safety stock. Current inventory + pipeline (471) is significantly below this requirements. However, the OR recommendation of 72 units seems to be calculating based on a lower historical average or conservative capping. Given the lead time is 4 periods, we need to order now to satisfy demand in Period 32.

My calculation of the target pipeline (Demand * (L+1) + Safety Stock) suggests we need ~650-700 total units in the system. Current system inventory (39 OH + 397 IT = 436) is lower than this target due to moderate ordering in previous periods.\n4. **Final Strategy**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 97 units.

Recent demands have been 147, 160, 141, and 118, averaging roughly 141 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data confirms actual lead time is 4 periods. The goal is to cover (L+1) periods (5 periods) of demand. Total pipeline and on-hand inventory should ideally be around 141 * 5 = 705 units. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 503 units, which includes orders from Period 41 (59), 42 (144), 43 (150), and 44 (150). The OR recommendation of 40 units is based on historical averages that likely do not fully account for the recent sustained higher demand levels. Following the logic of a base-stock policy with the higher demand mean: 705 (target) - 503 (pipeline) = 202 units. However, given the game's cap mechanism seen in historical OR recommendations and the need to manage holding costs if demand softens back, I will order 150 units \u2013 reaching the likely maximum order limit to urgently replenish the pipeline and satisfy the high-demand regime, ensuring we do not consistently stock out as we have in the last 4 periods.",

Therefore, any order placed now will only incur holding costs if the game were to continue, but more importantly, it cannot satisfy demand within the remaining window.

Current on-hand inventory is 128 units. Comparing this to the recent demand regime (which shifted in Period 41 to an average of ~149, but showed a lower value of 53 in Period 47), 128 units plus the 400 units already in-transit (reaching back to Period 44) will more than satisfy the demand for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). Specifically, the orders from Period 44 (150 units), Period 45 (150 units), and Period 46 (100 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 48, 49, and 50 respectively. Because the total units available or arriving before the end of Period 50 will drastically exceed expected demand, any further ordering is strictly a liability for holding costs.
